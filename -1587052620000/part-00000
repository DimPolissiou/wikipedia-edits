Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).

Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE. The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] traveled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday. A non-political publication called SNAP Peterborough is published monthly with sections for home, business, sporting events, etc. with a main focus on providing friendly and photographic news.<ref>{{cite web |title=snapd Peterborough |url=https://peterborough.snapd.com/ |publisher=snapd Inc. |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n\n* {{flag|United States}} [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] since 1983.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Peterborough, Ontario}}\n<!-- Other than the 3 people mentioned below, individuals should not be listed here, but rather in List of people from Peterborough, Ontario -->\n[[Sir Sandford Fleming]] originally came to the town in the late 1840s with his first impression finding it to be \"rather a poor little place\".<ref name=\"cheekyfleming\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |title        = Diaries of Sir Sandford Fleming\n |date         = June 17, 1845\n |accessdate   = December 8, 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090209065123/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |archive-date = February 9, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> However, since, there have been a number of people of note, including athletes, musicians, authors and more who made Peterborough their home.

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth.

In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John.

He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected.

The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here.

Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-39|F|1}} on December 21, 1871.<ref name=\"December 1871\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Peterborough ([[Trent University]]), 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes

However, the report offered another perspective, from mayor Daryl Bennett, who explained that there has been a shift toward employment in smaller manufacturing plants and in service industries, leading to a moderate level of unemployment. He added that the shift away from manufacturing had started well before the NAFTA free trade agreements. The president of the Unifor union local was less optimistic. \"The guy that runs a lathe or a guy that runs a C.N.C. machine or a guy that winds large motors \u2014 they\u2019re skilled guys.

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph's at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]]. The school opened in 1973, and moved to its current location in 2001.\n\n====Master's College and Seminary====\n{{Main|Master's College and Seminary}}\nMaster's College and Seminary is a Pentecostal Christian institution of higher education that consists of an on campus Bible College, a church-based Seminary, and a global distance education program. The school has partnerships with Trent University and [[Tyndale University College and Seminary]] of Toronto.\n\n===Public library system===\n[[Image:Peterborough Public Library, Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Peterborough's main library]]\nThe Peterborough Mechanics Institute, established in 1868, housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday.

These climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents, generally between [[latitude]]s 25\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 and are located poleward from adjacent tropical climates. \n\nWhile many subtropical climates tend to be located at or near coastal locations, in some cases they extend inland, most notably in [[China]] and the [[United States]], where they exhibit more pronounced seasonal variations and sharper contrasts between summer and winter, as part of a gradient between the more tropical climates of the southern coasts of these countries and the more continental climates of [[China]] and the [[United States]]' northern and central regions (localities around the Ohio and Yangtze rivers exhibiting continental influence from the north, compared to climates around the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[South China Sea]], which exhibit tropical influence due to their southern coastal positions).\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], '''''Cfa''''' and '''''Cwa''''' climates are either described as humid subtropical climates or mild temperate climates.

Monthly mean summer temperatures are normally between {{convert|24|and|27|C}}. A deep current of tropical air dominates the humid subtropics at the time of high sun, and daily intense (but brief) convective thundershowers are common.  Summer high temperatures are typically in the high 20s to mid-30s \u00b0C (80s or 90s \u00b0F), while overnight lows in the summer are typically in the lower 20s \u00b0C (70s \u00b0F).

Other areas have a more uniform or varying rainfall cycles, but consistently lack any predictably dry summer months. Most summer rainfall occurs during [[Air-mass thunderstorm|thunderstorms]] that build up due to the intense surface heating and strong subtropical sun angle. Weak [[tropical low]]s that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans, as well as infrequent tropical storms often contribute to summer seasonal rainfall peaks. Winter rainfall is often associated with large storms in the [[westerlies]] that have fronts that reach down into subtropical latitudes. However, many subtropical climates such as southeast Asia and Florida in the United States have very dry winters, with frequent brush fires and water shortages.\n\n== Breakdown of letters ==\n'''''Cfa''''': '''''C''''' = Mild temperate    '''''f''''' = Fully humid     '''''a''''' = Hot Summer\n\n'''''Cwa''''': '''''C''''' = Mild temperate   '''''w''''' = Dry Winter    '''''a''''' = Hot Summer <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hanschen.org/koppen/|title=K\u00f6ppen climate classification|last=Hans Chen|website=hanschen.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814145617/http://hanschen.org/koppen/|archive-date=2017-08-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Deliang|last2=Chen|first2=Hans Weiteng|date=April 2013|title=Using the K\u00f6ppen classification to quantify climate variation and change: An example for 1901\u20132010|journal=Environmental Development|language=en|volume=6|pages=69\u201379|doi=10.1016/j.envdev.2013.03.007}}</ref><br />\n==Africa==\n{{climate chart|[[Durban]], [[South Africa]]|21.1|27.8|134\n|21.1|28.0|113\n|20.2|27.7|120\n|17.4|26.1| 73\n|13.8|24.5| 59\n|10.6|23.0| 38\n|10.5|22.6| 39\n|12.5|22.8| 62\n|15.3|23.3| 73\n|16.8|24.0| 98\n|18.3|25.2|108\n|20.0|26.9|102\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n|source=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/climate/durban_climate.asp|title=Durban climate|website=SA Explorer|access-date=2013-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528123755/http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/climate/durban_climate.asp|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn Africa, humid subtropical climates are primarily found in the southern hemisphere of the continent. The ''Cwa'' climate is found over a large portion of the interior of the [[Central Africa|Middle]] and [[East Africa|Eastern African]] regions. This area includes central [[Angola]], northeastern [[Zimbabwe]], the [[Niassa Province|Niassa]], [[Manica Province|Manica]] and [[Tete Province|Tete]] provinces of [[Mozambique]], the southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] provinces, southwest [[Tanzania]], and the majority of [[Malawi]], and [[Zambia]]. Some lower portions of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] also have this climate.\n\nThe climate is also found in the narrow coastal sections of southern and eastern [[South Africa]], primarily in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and the [[Eastern Cape]] provinces. South Africa's version of this climate features heavy oceanic influences resulting in generally milder temperatures. This is particularly evident in its winters when temperatures do not drop as low as in many other regions within the humid subtropical category.\n\n==Asia==\n===East Asia===\n\nIn [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], this climate type is found in the southeastern quarter of [[mainland China]] from Hong Kong north to Nanjing, the northern half of [[Taiwan]], northern Myanmar, northern Vietnam, north through southern and central Japan ([[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]] and half of [[Honshu]]), and the extreme southern tip of South Korea around Busan. Cities near the equatorward boundary of this zone include [[Hong Kong]], [[Hanoi]] and [[Taipei]]; while [[Tokyo]] and [[Qingdao]] are near the northern boundary.\n\nThe influence of the strong [[Siberian anticyclone]] in East Asia brings colder winter temperatures than in the humid subtropical zones in North America, South America, and Australia. The {{convert|0|C}} isotherm reaches as far south as the valleys of the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and [[Wei River|Wei]] rivers, roughly [[34th parallel north|latitude 34\u00b0 N]]. At [[Hainan Island]] and in Taiwan, the climate transitions from subtropical into tropical. In most of this region, the winter monsoon is very well developed, as such eastern Asian humid subtropical zones have a strong winter dry season and heavy summer rainfall.\n\nOnly in inland areas below the Yangtze River and coastal areas between approximately the [[Huai River]] and the beginning of the coast of [[Guangdong]] is there sufficient winter rainfall to produce a ''Cfa'' climate; even in these areas, rainfall and [[runoff (water)|streamflow]] display a highly pronounced summer peak, unlike other regions of this climate type. [[Drought]] can be severe and often catastrophic to agriculture in the ''Cwa'' zone.\n\n{{climate chart\n | [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\n |  0.9 |  9.6 |  52.3\n |  1.7 | 10.4 |  56.1\n |  4.4 | 13.6 | 117.5\n | 9.4 | 19.0 | 124.5\n | 14.0 | 22.9 | 137.8\n | 18.0 | 25.5 | 167.7\n | 21.8 | 29.2 | 153.5\n | 23.0 | 30.8 | 168.2\n | 19.7 | 26.9 | 209.9\n | 14.2 | 21.5 | 197.8\n |  8.3 | 16.3 |  92.5\n |  3.5 | 11.9 |  51.0\n | source = [http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=47662&block_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E&year=&month=&day=&elm=normal&view= Japan Meteorological Agency]\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\nThe only area where winter precipitation equals or even exceeds the summer rain is around the [[San'in region]] at the western coast of Japan, which during winter is on the windward side of the westerlies. The winter precipitation in these regions is usually produced by low-pressure systems off the east coast that develop in the onshore flow from the Siberian high. Summer rainfall comes from the East Asian Monsoon and from frequent [[typhoon]]s. Annual rainfall is generally over {{convert|1,000|mm}}, and in areas below the Himalayas can be much higher still.\n\n===South Asia===\nHumid subtropical climates can also be found in [[South Asia]], primarily along the [[Ganges River]]. However, the humid subtropical climates exhibited here differ markedly from those in [[East Asia]] (and for that matter a good portion of the globe). Winters here are typically mild, dry and relatively short. They also tend to be foggy. Summers tend to be long and very hot, starting from mid-April and peaking in May and early June with high temperatures often exceeding {{convert|40|C}}. They also tend to be extremely dry, complete with [[dust storm]]s, traits usually associated with [[arid climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate]]s. During this period many native trees defoliate to save water. This is followed by the cooler [[monsoon]]s, where the region experiences heavy rains on almost a daily basis. Average high temperatures decrease during the monsoon season, but humidity increases. This results in hot and humid conditions, similar to summers in other humid subtropical climates. Cities such as [[New Delhi]], [[Lucknow]], [[Kanpur]] and [[Patna]] exhibit this atypical version of the climate in India. In Pakistan, the twin cities of [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]], as well as the city of [[Swabi]] in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, feature this weather pattern.\n\nIn South Asia, humid subtropical climates generally border on continental climates as altitude increases, or on winter-rainfall climates in western areas of Pakistan and northwestern India (e.g. [[Peshawar]] in northwestern Pakistan or [[Srinagar]] in the [[Kashmir Valley]] in India, where the primary precipitation peak occurs in March, not July or August). Further east, in highland areas with lengthier monsoons such as Nepal, seasonal temperature variation is lower than in the lowlands.\n\n===Western Asia===\n{{climate chart\n | [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]\n |  1.2 | 7.7 |  106\n |  1.8 | 8.9 |  129\n |  4.6 | 13.1 | 100\n | 7.7 | 18.2 | 112\n | 12.4 | 23.3 | 85\n | 15.9 | 26.4 | 105\n | 18.9 | 28.1 | 106\n | 19.5 | 28.9 | 86\n | 16.1 | 25.8 | 116\n | 11.9 | 21.3 | 108\n |  7.5 | 15.2 |  141\n | 3.5 | 10.3 |  139\n | source =<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_373950_kt.pdf |title=Data |website=www.dwd.de |access-date=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221151116/https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_373950_kt.pdf |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\n\nAlthough humid subtropical climates in Asia are mostly confined to the southeastern quarter of the continent, there are two narrow areas along the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] with humid subtropical climates. Summers in these locations are cooler than typical humid subtropical climates and  snowfall in winter is relatively common, but is usually of a short duration.\n\nIn [[Western Asia]], the climate is prevalent in the [[Gilan]] and [[M\u0101zandar\u0101n Province]]s of [[Iran]], in parts of the [[Caucasus]], in [[Azerbaijan]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] wedged between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas and coastal ([[Black Sea]]) Turkey, albeit having more oceanic influence.\n\nAnnual rainfall ranges from around {{convert|740|mm}} at [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] to over {{convert|2000|mm}} at [[Bandar-e Anzali]], and is heavy throughout the year, with a maximum in October or November when Bandar-e Anzali can average 400 millimetres (16&nbsp;inches).

It can also be found in the Midwest, primarily in the central and southern portions of Kansas and Missouri, and the southern portions of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nIn [[Mexico]], there are small areas of ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climates. The climate can be found in small areas scattered around the northeastern part of the country, in proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Other areas where the climate can be found is in the high elevations of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre Oriental. Despite being located at higher elevations, these locations have summers that are too warm to qualify as a subtropical highland climate. [[Guadalajara]]'s climate is a major example of this.\n\nOutside of isolated sections of Mexico, the southernmost limits of this climate zone in [[North America]] lie just north of South Florida and around southern coastal Texas. Cities at the southernmost limits, such as Tampa and Orlando and along the Texas coast around [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] down toward [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] generally feature warm weather year-round and minimal temperature differences between seasons. In contrast, cities at the northernmost limits of the climate zone such as New York and Philadelphia feature hot, humid summers and chilly winters. These areas have average winter temperatures at the coldest limit of climates classed as humid subtropical.\n\n[[Snowfall]] varies greatly in this climate zone. In locations at the southern limits of this zone and areas around the [[Gulf Coast]], cities such as Orlando, Tampa, Houston, New Orleans, and Savannah rarely see snowfall, which occurs, at most, a few times per generation.

Closer to the [[South Atlantic]] and Gulf coasts, there is a summer maximum, with July or August usually the wettest month \u2013 as at Norfolk, Cape Hatteras and Jacksonville, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans. A semblance of a monsoon pattern (dry winters/wet summers) is evident along the Atlantic coast from southern North Carolina (Wilmington, North Carolina area) south to Florida. The seasonal monsoon is much stronger on the Florida peninsula, as most locations in Florida have dry winters and wet summers.\n\nIn addition, areas in Texas that are slightly inland from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Austin and San Antonio that border the [[semi-arid climate]] zone, generally see a peak of precipitation in May, a drought-like nadir in mid-summer and a secondary, if not equal, precipitation peak in September or October.

Winter rainfall is often associated with large storms in the [[westerlies]] that have fronts that reach down into subtropical latitudes. However, many subtropical climates such as southeast Asia and Florida in the United States have very dry winters, with frequent brush fires and water shortages.\n\n== Breakdown of letters ==\n'''''Cfa''''': '''''C''''' = Mild temperate    '''''f''''' = Fully humid     '''''a''''' = Hot Summer\n\n'''''Cwa''''': '''''C''''' = Mild temperate   '''''w''''' = Dry Winter    '''''a''''' = Hot Summer <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hanschen.org/koppen/|title=K\u00f6ppen climate classification|last=Hans Chen|website=hanschen.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814145617/http://hanschen.org/koppen/|archive-date=2017-08-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Deliang|last2=Chen|first2=Hans Weiteng|date=April 2013|title=Using the K\u00f6ppen classification to quantify climate variation and change: An example for 1901\u20132010|journal=Environmental Development|language=en|volume=6|pages=69\u201379|doi=10.1016/j.envdev.2013.03.007}}</ref><br />\n==Africa==\n{{climate chart|[[Durban]], [[South Africa]]|21.1|27.8|134\n|21.1|28.0|113\n|20.2|27.7|120\n|17.4|26.1| 73\n|13.8|24.5| 59\n|10.6|23.0| 38\n|10.5|22.6| 39\n|12.5|22.8| 62\n|15.3|23.3| 73\n|16.8|24.0| 98\n|18.3|25.2|108\n|20.0|26.9|102\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n|source=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/climate/durban_climate.asp|title=Durban climate|website=SA Explorer|access-date=2013-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528123755/http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/climate/durban_climate.asp|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn Africa, humid subtropical climates are primarily found in the southern hemisphere of the continent. The ''Cwa'' climate is found over a large portion of the interior of the [[Central Africa|Middle]] and [[East Africa|Eastern African]] regions. This area includes central [[Angola]], northeastern [[Zimbabwe]], the [[Niassa Province|Niassa]], [[Manica Province|Manica]] and [[Tete Province|Tete]] provinces of [[Mozambique]], the southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] provinces, southwest [[Tanzania]], and the majority of [[Malawi]], and [[Zambia]]. Some lower portions of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] also have this climate.\n\nThe climate is also found in the narrow coastal sections of southern and eastern [[South Africa]], primarily in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and the [[Eastern Cape]] provinces. South Africa's version of this climate features heavy oceanic influences resulting in generally milder temperatures. This is particularly evident in its winters when temperatures do not drop as low as in many other regions within the humid subtropical category.\n\n==Asia==\n===East Asia===\n\nIn [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], this climate type is found in the southeastern quarter of [[mainland China]] from Hong Kong north to Nanjing, the northern half of [[Taiwan]], northern Myanmar, northern Vietnam, north through southern and central Japan ([[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]] and half of [[Honshu]]), and the extreme southern tip of South Korea around Busan. Cities near the equatorward boundary of this zone include [[Hong Kong]], [[Hanoi]] and [[Taipei]]; while [[Tokyo]] and [[Qingdao]] are near the northern boundary.\n\nThe influence of the strong [[Siberian anticyclone]] in East Asia brings colder winter temperatures than in the humid subtropical zones in North America, South America, and Australia. The {{convert|0|C}} isotherm reaches as far south as the valleys of the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and [[Wei River|Wei]] rivers, roughly [[34th parallel north|latitude 34\u00b0 N]]. At [[Hainan Island]] and in Taiwan, the climate transitions from subtropical into tropical. In most of this region, the winter monsoon is very well developed, as such eastern Asian humid subtropical zones have a strong winter dry season and heavy summer rainfall.\n\nOnly in inland areas below the Yangtze River and coastal areas between approximately the [[Huai River]] and the beginning of the coast of [[Guangdong]] is there sufficient winter rainfall to produce a ''Cfa'' climate; even in these areas, rainfall and [[runoff (water)|streamflow]] display a highly pronounced summer peak, unlike other regions of this climate type. [[Drought]] can be severe and often catastrophic to agriculture in the ''Cwa'' zone.\n\n{{climate chart\n | [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\n |  0.9 |  9.6 |  52.3\n |  1.7 | 10.4 |  56.1\n |  4.4 | 13.6 | 117.5\n | 9.4 | 19.0 | 124.5\n | 14.0 | 22.9 | 137.8\n | 18.0 | 25.5 | 167.7\n | 21.8 | 29.2 | 153.5\n | 23.0 | 30.8 | 168.2\n | 19.7 | 26.9 | 209.9\n | 14.2 | 21.5 | 197.8\n |  8.3 | 16.3 |  92.5\n |  3.5 | 11.9 |  51.0\n | source = [http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=47662&block_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E&year=&month=&day=&elm=normal&view= Japan Meteorological Agency]\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\nThe only area where winter precipitation equals or even exceeds the summer rain is around the [[San'in region]] at the western coast of Japan, which during winter is on the windward side of the westerlies. The winter precipitation in these regions is usually produced by low-pressure systems off the east coast that develop in the onshore flow from the Siberian high. Summer rainfall comes from the East Asian Monsoon and from frequent [[typhoon]]s. Annual rainfall is generally over {{convert|1,000|mm}}, and in areas below the Himalayas can be much higher still.\n\n===South Asia===\nHumid subtropical climates can also be found in [[South Asia]], primarily along the [[Ganges River]]. However, the humid subtropical climates exhibited here differ markedly from those in [[East Asia]] (and for that matter a good portion of the globe). Winters here are typically mild, dry and relatively short. They also tend to be foggy. Summers tend to be long and very hot, starting from mid-April and peaking in May and early June with high temperatures often exceeding {{convert|40|C}}. They also tend to be extremely dry, complete with [[dust storm]]s, traits usually associated with [[arid climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate]]s. During this period many native trees defoliate to save water. This is followed by the cooler [[monsoon]]s, where the region experiences heavy rains on almost a daily basis. Average high temperatures decrease during the monsoon season, but humidity increases. This results in hot and humid conditions, similar to summers in other humid subtropical climates. Cities such as [[New Delhi]], [[Lucknow]], [[Kanpur]] and [[Patna]] exhibit this atypical version of the climate in India. In Pakistan, the twin cities of [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]], as well as the city of [[Swabi]] in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, feature this weather pattern.\n\nIn South Asia, humid subtropical climates generally border on continental climates as altitude increases, or on winter-rainfall climates in western areas of Pakistan and northwestern India (e.g. [[Peshawar]] in northwestern Pakistan or [[Srinagar]] in the [[Kashmir Valley]] in India, where the primary precipitation peak occurs in March, not July or August). Further east, in highland areas with lengthier monsoons such as Nepal, seasonal temperature variation is lower than in the lowlands.\n\n===Western Asia===\n{{climate chart\n | [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]\n |  1.2 | 7.7 |  106\n |  1.8 | 8.9 |  129\n |  4.6 | 13.1 | 100\n | 7.7 | 18.2 | 112\n | 12.4 | 23.3 | 85\n | 15.9 | 26.4 | 105\n | 18.9 | 28.1 | 106\n | 19.5 | 28.9 | 86\n | 16.1 | 25.8 | 116\n | 11.9 | 21.3 | 108\n |  7.5 | 15.2 |  141\n | 3.5 | 10.3 |  139\n | source =<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_373950_kt.pdf |title=Data |website=www.dwd.de |access-date=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221151116/https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_373950_kt.pdf |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\n\nAlthough humid subtropical climates in Asia are mostly confined to the southeastern quarter of the continent, there are two narrow areas along the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] with humid subtropical climates. Summers in these locations are cooler than typical humid subtropical climates and  snowfall in winter is relatively common, but is usually of a short duration.\n\nIn [[Western Asia]], the climate is prevalent in the [[Gilan]] and [[M\u0101zandar\u0101n Province]]s of [[Iran]], in parts of the [[Caucasus]], in [[Azerbaijan]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] wedged between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas and coastal ([[Black Sea]]) Turkey, albeit having more oceanic influence.\n\nAnnual rainfall ranges from around {{convert|740|mm}} at [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] to over {{convert|2000|mm}} at [[Bandar-e Anzali]], and is heavy throughout the year, with a maximum in October or November when Bandar-e Anzali can average 400 millimetres (16&nbsp;inches). Temperatures are generally moderate in comparison with other parts of Western Asia. During winter, the coastal areas can receive snowfall, which is usually of a short duration.\n\nIn [[Rasht]], the average maximum in July is around {{convert|28|C}} but with near-saturation [[humidity]], whilst in January it is around {{convert|9|C}}. The heavy, evenly distributed rainfall extends north into the Caspian coastal strip of [[Azerbaijan]] up to its northern border but this climate in Azerbaijan is, however, a ''Cfb''/''Cfa'' (''Oceanic climate''/''Humid subtropical climate'') borderline case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water+Resurs.html|title=Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic|last=Mahmudov|first=Rza|date=June 4, 2003|website=Hydromet Azerbaijan|publisher=Scientific Research Institute of Hydrometeorology, [[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan Republic]]|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012193627/http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html|archive-date=12 October 2007|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>\n\nWestern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Batumi]] and [[Kutaisi]]) in the [[Colchis|Kolkheti Lowland]] and the northeast coast of [[Turkey]] ([[Giresun]]), have a climate similar to that of Gilan and Mazandaran in Iran and very similar to that of southeastern and northern Azerbaijan. Temperatures range from {{convert|22|C}} in summer to {{convert|5|C}} in winter and rainfall is even heavier than in Caspian Iran, up to {{convert|2300|mm}} per year in [[Hopa]] (Turkey). These climates are a ''Cfb''/''Cfa'' (''Oceanic climate''/''Humid subtropical climate'') borderline case.\n\n==North America==\nIn North America, humid subtropical climates are found in the American Gulf and lower East Coast states, including [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]. On the Florida peninsula, the humid subtropical climate gives way to the [[tropical climate]] of [[south Florida]] and the [[Florida Keys]].\n{{climate chart\n | [[Houston]], [[United States]]\n |  6.2 | 17.2 | 85.9\n |  8.1 | 19.1 | 81.3\n | 11.4 | 22.8 | 86.6\n | 15.2 | 26.4 | 84.1\n | 19.8 | 30.2 | 129.3\n | 23.1 | 33.0 | 150.6\n | 23.9 | 34.3 | 96.3\n | 23.8 | 34.7 | 95.5\n | 21.0 | 32.1 | 104.6\n | 16.1 | 27.8 | 144.8\n | 11.2 | 22.5 | 110.2\n |  7.0 | 17.9 | 95.0\n | source =<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/hgx/climate_iah|title=Houston IAH Climate Data|website=NOAA, National Weather Service|publisher=US Department of Commerce|access-date=2017-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822113552/https://www.weather.gov/hgx/climate_iah|archive-date=2018-08-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\nUnder K\u00f6ppen's climate classification, the climate can also be found in the Mid-Atlantic, primarily eastern Virginia, the lower elevations of West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania, far southern New York, specifically [[New York City]] and sections of [[Long Island]]. It can also be found in the Midwest, primarily in the central and southern portions of Kansas and Missouri, and the southern portions of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nIn [[Mexico]], there are small areas of ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climates. The climate can be found in small areas scattered around the northeastern part of the country, in proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Other areas where the climate can be found is in the high elevations of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre Oriental. Despite being located at higher elevations, these locations have summers that are too warm to qualify as a subtropical highland climate. [[Guadalajara]]'s climate is a major example of this.\n\nOutside of isolated sections of Mexico, the southernmost limits of this climate zone in [[North America]] lie just north of South Florida and around southern coastal Texas. Cities at the southernmost limits, such as Tampa and Orlando and along the Texas coast around [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] down toward [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] generally feature warm weather year-round and minimal temperature differences between seasons. In contrast, cities at the northernmost limits of the climate zone such as New York and Philadelphia feature hot, humid summers and chilly winters. These areas have average winter temperatures at the coldest limit of climates classed as humid subtropical.\n\n[[Snowfall]] varies greatly in this climate zone. In locations at the southern limits of this zone and areas around the [[Gulf Coast]], cities such as Orlando, Tampa, Houston, New Orleans, and Savannah rarely see snowfall, which occurs, at most, a few times per generation. In Southern cities farther north or inland, such as [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], snow only occasionally falls and is usually three inches or less.

Much of the interior South, including Tennessee, Kentucky, and the northern halves of Mississippi and Alabama, tends to have a winter or spring (not summer) precipitation maximum. Closer to the [[South Atlantic]] and Gulf coasts, there is a summer maximum, with July or August usually the wettest month \u2013 as at Norfolk, Cape Hatteras and Jacksonville, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans. A semblance of a monsoon pattern (dry winters/wet summers) is evident along the Atlantic coast from southern North Carolina (Wilmington, North Carolina area) south to Florida. The seasonal monsoon is much stronger on the Florida peninsula, as most locations in Florida have dry winters and wet summers.\n\nIn addition, areas in Texas that are slightly inland from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Austin and San Antonio that border the [[semi-arid climate]] zone, generally see a peak of precipitation in May, a drought-like nadir in mid-summer and a secondary, if not equal, precipitation peak in September or October. Areas further south along [[South Texas]]' Gulf Coast (Brownsville), which closely border [[Tropical climate|tropical climate classification]], typically have a strong September precipitation maximum, and a tendency toward dry conditions in winter with rain increasing in spring, with December or January often the driest months.\n\n==South America==\n\n{{climate chart|[[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]\n|20.4|30.4|122\n|19.4|28.7|123\n|17.0|26.4|154\n|13.7|22.7|107\n|10.3|19.0| 92\n| 7.6|15.6| 50\n| 7.4|13.9| 53\n| 8.9|17.3| 63\n| 9.9|18.9| 78\n|13.0|22.5|139\n|15.9|25.3|131\n|18.4|28.1|103\n|float=right\n|clear=right\n|source=[http://www.smn.gov.ar/?mod=clima&id=30&provincia=Capital%20Federal&ciudad=Buenos%20Aires National Meteorological Service]\n}}\nHumid subtropical climates are found in a sizable portion of South America.

As an example [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] which lies in the centre of this zone, the annual rainfall can range from less than {{convert|550|mm|in}} in 1915 to more than {{convert|2780|mm|in}} in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=139&p_display_type=dataFile&p_stn_num=058037|title=Monthly Rainfall Lismore (Centre Street)|last=|first=|date=|website=Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050426/http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=139&p_display_type=dataFile&p_stn_num=058037|archive-date=24 September 2015|access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Europe==\n{{climate chart\n | [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]\n |  3.8 |  7.6 | 58.0\n |  4.3 |  9.0 | 56.9\n |  6.6 | 12.2 | 63.4\n | 10.0 | 16.5 | 82.8\n | 14.5 | 21.6 | 84.2\n | 17.8 | 25.0 | 100.4\n | 20.3 | 27.9 | 62.1\n | 20.4 | 27.7 | 84.5\n | 16.8 | 23.3 | 103.4\n | 12.7 | 17.8 | 111.4\n |  8.1 | 12.3 | 107.4\n |  4.0 |  8.8 | 88.5\n | source =<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/viewClino.php?type=File&station=110&name_station=Trieste+Barcola|title=Application Control Violation|website=clima.meteoam.it|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818161052/http://clima.meteoam.it/viewClino.php?type=File&station=110&name_station=Trieste%20Barcola|archive-date=2014-08-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n | float  = right\n | clear = right\n}}\nIn [[Central Europe]], a small area of humid subtropical climates are located in transitional areas between the oceanic and continental climates in areas where higher summer temperature do not quite qualify it for inclusion in the Oceanic climate schema (but, in the [[Trewartha climate classification]], this type of climate is included in that typical of the other areas of central-west Europe, classified as Do -the Temperate Oceanic climate-) and mild winters do not allow their inclusion into continental climates. Average summer temperatures in areas of [[Europe]] with this climate are generally not as hot as most other subtropical zones around the world.\n\nThe [[Po Valley]], in [[Northern Italy]], including major cities such as [[Milan]], [[Turin]], [[Bologna]], and [[Verona]], have a humid subtropical climate, featuring hot, humid summers with frequent thunderstorms; winters are foggy, damp and chilly, with sudden bursts of frost. Some parts of the valley have a mild continental climate. Places along the shores of [[Lake Maggiore]], [[Lake Lugano]], [[Lake Como]] ([[Como]] and [[Verbania]] in [[Italy]] and [[Lugano]] in [[Switzerland]]) have a humid subtropical climate with a distinctive high amount of rainfall during summer. Budapest, Hungary is just warm enough to qualify, due to recent warming. At 46 degrees north, the city lies on the northern limit of the humid subtropical zone.  \n\nThe coastal areas in the northern half of the [[Adriatic Sea]] also fall within this climate zone. The cities include [[Trieste]], [[Venice]], and [[Rimini]] in [[Italy]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]], [[Koper]] in [[Slovenia]] and [[Kotor]] in [[Montenegro]]. Other Southern European areas in the ''Cfa'' zone include the central valleys and coast of [[Catalonia]] of [[Girona]] and [[Barcelona]] in [[Spain]], some on the north-east of Spain ([[Huesca]]), [[West Macedonia]] in [[Greece]] ([[Kozani]]), the [[Garonne|Garonne Valley]] ([[Toulouse]]) and [[Rhone|Rhone Valley]] ([[Valence (city)|Valence]]) in [[France]]. More recent data have included the most extreme south of [[Germany]], being [[Balingen]] the limit of this climatic type, but with more [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] characteristics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-europe.php|title=Interactive Europe Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|last=|first=|date=|website=PlantMaps|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307173829/https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-europe.php|archive-date=2019-03-07|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> \n\nAlong the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Bulgaria]] ([[Varna]]), coast of [[Romania]] ([[Constanta]] and [[Mamaia]]), [[Sochi, Russia]] and [[Crimea]], have summers too warm (>{{convert|22|C}} in the warmest month) to qualify as oceanic, no freezing month, and enough summer precipitation and sometimes humid conditions, where they would be fit to be classed under ''Cfa'', though they closely border the [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] zone. All these areas are subject to occasional, in some cases repeated snowfalls and freezes during winter.\n\nIn the [[Azores]], some islands have this climate, with very mild and rainy winters (>{{convert|13|C}}) and no snowfall, warm summers (>{{convert|21|C}}) but with no dry season during the warmest period, which means that they can be classified neither as oceanic, nor as the Mediterranean, but only as humid subtropical climate, as with [[Corvo Island]].\n\nIn many other climate classification systems outside of the K\u00f6ppen, most of these locations would not be included in the humid subtropical grouping. The higher summer precipitation and poleward flow of tropical air-masses in summer are not present in Europe as they are in eastern Australia or the southern United States.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Subtropics]]\n*[[Subtropical ridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Koppen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Humid Subtropical Climate}}\n[[Category:Climate]]\n[[Category:K\u00f6ppen climate classifications]]\n[[Category:Climate of Africa]]\n[[Category:Climate of Asia]]\n[[Category:Climate of Australia]]\n[[Category:Climate of Europe]]\n[[Category:Climate of North America]]\n[[Category:Climate of South America]]\n", "name_user": "2607:fea8:e60:14de:f1b7:9d46:edfc:249c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate"}

The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the [[Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.\n\nDivision among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Libya After Qaddafi: Lessons and Implications for the Future|last=Chivvis|first=Christopher S.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings.

He set up the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] (LROR), which was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013.

Its commander was Adel Gharyani.\n\nIn October 2013, following the kidnapping of the Prime Minister, Abusahmain used his presidency to change the agenda of the GNC in order to prevent a debate over disestablishing the LROR. At the same time, he cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate the allocation, by Abusahmain himself, of 900 million Libyan Dinars (US$720 million) to the LROR and various other armed groups.<ref name=\"John, Ronald Bruce 2014 p. 201\" /> Instead, the LROR had its responsibilities reduced by the GNC but was allowed to continue to operate, and no one was prosecuted for the incident.\n\n=== Kidnapping of Prime Minister Zeidan ===\nMost journalists reported that the kidnapping of Zeidan was by the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] (LROR) (Ghurfat Amaliyat al-Thuwar) created by Abusahmain by decree 143 of 7 July.

The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the [[Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.\n\nDivision among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Libya After Qaddafi: Lessons and Implications for the Future|last=Chivvis|first=Christopher S.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings.
