However, in this context, the term \"Far East\" is used by the Europeans to cover ASEAN countries and the countries in East Asia. However, being a Eurocentric term, [[Far East]] describes the region's geographical position in relation to Europe rather than its location within Asia. Alternatively, the term \"[[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific Region]]\" is often used in describing East Asia, Southeast Asia as well as [[Oceania]].\n\nObservers preferring a broader definition of \"East Asia\" often use the term [[Northeast Asia]] to refer to the greater China area, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, with [[Southeast Asia]] covering the ten [[ASEAN]] countries. This usage, which is seen in economic and diplomatic discussions, is at odds with the historical meanings of both \"East Asia\" and \"Northeast Asia\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher M.

However, in this context, the term \"Far East\" is used by the Europeans to cover ASEAN countries and the countries in East Asia. However, being a Eurocentric term, [[Far East]] describes the region's geographical position in relation to Europe rather than its location within Asia. Alternatively, the term \"[[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific Region]]\" is often used in describing East Asia, Southeast Asia as well as [[Oceania]].\n\nObservers preferring a broader definition of \"East Asia\" often use the term [[Northeast Asia]] to refer to the greater China area, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, with [[Southeast Asia]] covering the ten [[ASEAN]] countries. This usage, which is seen in economic and diplomatic discussions, is at odds with the historical meanings of both \"East Asia\" and \"Northeast Asia\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher M.

He changed his name on coming of age and inheriting property. After studying at private schools, and with tutors, he adopted the profession of a [[civil engineer]], but on completing his articles abandoned it for sport and sporting literature.\n\n==Angler==\nIn 1851 he married Mary Cole of Oxford, and devoted himself to angling. He was angling editor of ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' for more than a quarter of a century, and frequently wrote about his own experiences. Francis established the Thames Rights Defence Association, throughout life advocated the cause of fish culture, and suggested the plan of the National Fish-Culture Association. He had a large share, too, in introducing English [[trout]] to [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]n streams.\n\nFrancis was a member of the commission on [[oyster]] culture from 1868 to 1870. As naturalist director for some years of the [[Brighton Aquarium]] he observed fish and made experiments on their culture.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Grave of Francis Francis in Twickenham Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Grave of Francis Francis and family in [[Twickenham Cemetery]]]]\nHe was seized with a severe stroke of paralysis in 1883. Though he eventually recovered from this, he grew thinner month by month, and an old cancer recurred. He died in his chair on 24 December 1886. He had long lived at [[Twickenham]] and was buried there.\n\nThe following quotation appears below his name on his gravestone: <blockquote>And angle on, and beg to have<br>A quiet passage to a welcome grave.</blockquote> These are the closings lines to the poem ''The Angler's Wish'' by English writer [[Izaak Walton]].<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/360/5/97.html The Angler's Wish], ''The World's Best Poetry'', ed. by Bliss Carman, et al.

He changed his name on coming of age and inheriting property. After studying at private schools, and with tutors, he adopted the profession of a [[civil engineer]], but on completing his articles abandoned it for sport and sporting literature.\n\n==Angler==\nIn 1851 he married Mary Cole of Oxford, and devoted himself to angling. He was angling editor of ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' for more than a quarter of a century, and frequently wrote about his own experiences. Francis established the Thames Rights Defence Association, throughout life advocated the cause of fish culture, and suggested the plan of the National Fish-Culture Association. He had a large share, too, in introducing English [[trout]] to [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]n streams.\n\nFrancis was a member of the commission on [[oyster]] culture from 1868 to 1870. As naturalist director for some years of the [[Brighton Aquarium]] he observed fish and made experiments on their culture.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Grave of Francis Francis in Twickenham Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Grave of Francis Francis and family in [[Twickenham Cemetery]]]]\nHe was seized with a severe stroke of paralysis in 1883. Though he eventually recovered from this, he grew thinner month by month, and an old cancer recurred. He died in his chair on 24 December 1886. He had long lived at [[Twickenham]] and was buried there.\n\nThe following quotation appears below his name on his gravestone: <blockquote>And angle on, and beg to have<br>A quiet passage to a welcome grave.</blockquote> These are the closings lines to the poem ''The Angler's Wish'' by English writer [[Izaak Walton]].<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/360/5/97.html The Angler's Wish], ''The World's Best Poetry'', ed. by Bliss Carman, et al.

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ====\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

In patients who have diffused loss of aeration, PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.\n\nMost modern ventilators have basic monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration.

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ====\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration. There are lipseal mouthpieces with flanges to help hold them in place if patient is unable.\n\n==History==\nThe Greek physician [[Galen]] may have been the first to describe mechanical ventilation: \"If you take a dead animal and blow air through its larynx [through a reed], you will fill its bronchi and watch its lungs attain the greatest distention.\"<ref name=tobin06>{{cite book|last=Colice|first=Gene L|title=Principles & Practice of Mechanical Ventilation|editor=Martin J Tobin|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2006|edition=2|chapter=Historical Perspective on the Development of Mechanical Ventilation|isbn=978-0-07-144767-6}}</ref> [[Vesalius]] too describes ventilation by inserting a reed or cane into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of animals.<ref name=\"RCP\">{{cite journal |author=Chamberlain D |title=Never quite there: a tale of resuscitation medicine |journal=Clin Med |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=573\u20137 |year=2003 |pmid=14703040 |pmc=4952587 |doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.3-6-573 }}</ref> In 1908 [[George Poe]] demonstrated his mechanical respirator by asphyxiating dogs and seemingly bringing them back to life.<ref name=smother>{{cite news|title=Smother Small Dog To See it Revived|quote=Successful Demonstration of an Artificial Respiration Machine Cheered in Brooklyn.

Their presence in Parliament is owed to the number of votes that their party won, not to votes received by the MP personally. This occurs only in countries which have an electoral system based on [[party-list proportional representation]]. \n\n==Different systems==\nIn some countries, seats in the chamber are filled solely in accordance with the share of votes won by each individual party. Thus, in [[Israel]], all Members of the [[Knesset]] (MKs) are list members. Under this system, MKs are appointed from lists of candidates created by each party until the party has reached its allocated number. In other countries, a more complicated system is used. In the method used in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], some seats are filled using party lists, while others are filled by the \"traditional\" [[First Past the Post electoral system|First Past the Post]] system.

The other 49 MPs are selected from the party lists. The List MPs each party gets is the difference between a party's total allocation of seats in parliament and its number of electorate MPs.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe existence of list MPs has caused controversy in some countries. It is sometimes complained that because list MPs do not have a geographic electorate, they are not properly accountable to anyone. In addition, the methods used to create party lists are sometimes criticised as undemocratic &mdash; in a [[closed list]] system, the public have no way of influencing the composition of a party list. In this situation, the public cannot support one candidate without also supporting other candidates from the same party. Supporters of party list proportional representation sometimes retort that the public often have little control over the selection of local candidates, either &mdash; if a voter's preferred party selects a poor candidate, the voter is forced to either vote for a candidate they dislike or vote for a party they dislike. Under a party list system, voters can support their preferred party even if they are unwilling to vote for its local candidate.\n\nAn [[open list]] system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/es/esd/esd02/esd02e/esd02e03|title=Open, Closed and Free lists}}</ref> however, may go some way to addressing the concern that voters can only support all the candidates that were proposed by the party. A notable example of this was in the [[Dutch general election, 2006|Dutch general election of 2006]]. The [[VVD]] had chosen [[Mark Rutte]] as their party leader ([[lijsttrekker]]). In the Netherlands, the party leader usually gets a large majority of the votes for that party, but in 2006 the number 2 on the list, [[Rita Verdonk]] got over 10% more votes than Mark Rutte. This eventually led to Rita Verdonk leaving the VVD and starting her own party.\n\nThere is also debate about the right of a list MP to switch parties. Because list MPs gain their positions by virtue of being on a party list, rather than by winning votes personally, some contend that the party, not the MP, is the rightful \"owner\" of the seat.
