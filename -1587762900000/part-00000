All existing debt was wiped away and the development has $30 million in hand to complete several of the unfinished infrastructure projects.  The Lake Las Vegas bankruptcy creditors, not Lake Las Vegas development themselves, have filed a lawsuit against the former insiders (Bass Brothers, TransContinental, etc.). The creditors' theory is that the $500 million equity loan the former insiders took against the property caused the demise of Lake Las Vegas.  The creditors are hoping to recoup money from the former insiders.  In a related action, resort property owners are suing lender [[Credit Suisse#2000s|Credit Suisse]] as part of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit led by bankrupt [[Yellowstone Club]] founder [[Tim Blixseth|Timothy Blixseth]] and his son Beau Blixseth who claim the Lake Las Vegas Joint Venture bankruptcy was caused by a \"loan to own\" scheme between the bank and resort developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703580904574638052691063912 |title=Luxury-Property Owners Sue Credit Suisse for $24 Billion|first=Jaqueline |last=Palank |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= January 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe golf course was purchased by Nevada South Shore LLC, a Hawaii-based corporation for $4.5 million on February 17, 2011.<ref name=lvs20110401/>\n\nThe Ritz Carlton, Lake Las Vegas, closed after 8 years of operation on  May 2, 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ritz-Carlton Lake Las Vegas to close in May|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/08/ritz-carlton-lake-las-vegas/|first=Amanda|last=Finnegan|date=February 8, 2010|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]}}</ref>  The Ritz Carlton was then reopened by international boutique hotelier Dolce Hotels on February 11, 2011, as the Ravella at Lake Las Vegas.<ref name=lvs20110401>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Takahashi |title= New hotel banks on Lake Las Vegas bouncing back |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/11/lake-las-vegas/ |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=Feb 11, 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-11 }}</ref> On April 30, 2013, Kam Sang Co. announced that the Ravella would be renamed the Hilton Lake Las Vegas, the name under which the hotel continues to operate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2013/apr/30/lake-las-vegas-hotel-getting-new-name-again/#/0|title=Lake Las Vegas hotel getting new name \u2014 again|first=Eli|last=Segall|publisher=Vegas Inc|date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> The Hilton opened June 6, 2013.<ref>{{cite press|title=Hilton Hotels & Resorts Makes Lake Las Vegas Debut|publisher=Hilton Hotels & Resorts|date=June 6, 2013|url=http://news.hilton.com/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/23369}}</ref>\n\nLake Las Vegas was the subject of a lawsuit between investment fund Claymore Holdings and [[Credit Suisse]], which was the agent for a syndicate of entities that loaned $540 million to develop the property.
