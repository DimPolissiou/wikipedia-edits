It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] core on the [[Yukon River]]'s west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the [[Yukon River]] ({{cvt|640|m||}}). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]], one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=[[Whitehorse Star]]|date=14 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Lights (6879315371).jpg|thumb|left|An [[aurora]] over a residential neighbourhood of [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]].

In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge. By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Twice the show travelled to Alert, the Canadian Forces Station five hundred miles from the North Pole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1976, the Company undertook to produce not only the Whitehorse show, but the entertainment in Dawson City's Palace Grand Theatre and Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Casino. At the end of the 1980 season they left Dawson City. In January 1981, the show joined the \"Snow Birds\" for a season and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, for a four-month run. The fall of 1990 saw the Frantic Follies taking to the road again as ambassadors for the Yukon in a whirlwind tour, performing in ten Canadian and American cities in a little over two weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe Frantic Follies was in part replaced by another vaudeville show by the same producer, the Klondike Follies, which hosted two events in the summer of 2017 and 20 shows in the summer of 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/curtain-falls-on-performer-s-local-career|title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Curtain falls on performer's local career|work=Whitehorse Daily Star|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPlays are also performed at the Guild Hall in Porter Creek, and downtown Whitehorse's Wood Street Centre offers smaller local productions.

They will lend assistance to crews in B.C., Alberta, and the other territories as needed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Energy grid===\n[[Yukon Energy]] operates four conventional hydroelectric generating stations: Whitehorse Dam (40 MW), Aishihik Lake (37 MW), Mayo A (5 MW), and Mayo B (10 MW), which provide the bulk of generation for the Yukon Energy grid. An additional 39 MW of diesel generation is maintained for supplemental back-up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Facilities|url=http://www.yukonenergy.ca/energy/facilities/|publisher=Yukon Energy|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Yukon Energy operates two wind turbines near Whitehorse, which are connected to the Whitehorse-Aishihik-Faro grid. The first turbine is a Bonus Energy 150&nbsp;kW MARK III installed in 1993 that is no longer functional. The second turbine, a [[Vestas]] 660&nbsp;kW V47 LT II was later installed in 2000 and operates only in the summer. These units need to be specially adapted to deal with icing and the northern environment.<ref>[http://www.yukonenergy.ca/ Yukon Energy]. Yukonenergy.ca.

During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.\n\nIn 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.\n\n===Transportation===\n====Air====\nWhitehorse is served by the [[Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport]] and has scheduled service to [[Vancouver]], [[Kelowna]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Yellowknife]], [[Ottawa]] (via [[Yellowknife]]), [[Dawson City]], [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]], [[Inuvik]], as well as  [[Frankfurt]], Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941\u201342 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal. [[Air North]], a scheduled passenger and cargo airline operating [[Boeing 737]] jetliners and [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] turboprops, is based in Whitehorse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air North, Yukon's Airline |url=https://www.flyairnorth.com/default.aspx |website=www.flyairnorth.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 work was completed on a {{convert|340|m|abbr=on}} runway extension and other improvements (concrete turn button, installation of storm and sanitary mains, lighting upgrades, tower access road and blast pad).<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitehorse International Airport Runway Extension|url=http://www.yes-group.ca/index.php/Transportation/view_project/airport_runway_extension/|publisher=YES Group|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Expansion of the terminal itself was completed in 2010.\n[[File:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge of the [[Alaska Highway]] crossing over the [[Teslin River]] at [[Johnsons Crossing]].]]\n\n====Roads====\nSurface access to Whitehorse is provided by a network of highways, including the international [[Alaska Highway]] connecting the Yukon with Alaska, British Columbia, and [[Alberta]] highway networks.\n\nWhitehorse has been described as \"pearls on a string\", with its residential, industrial, and service subdivisions located along the main thoroughfares that carry traffic within city limits, with large gaps of undeveloped (often hilly) land between them. The [[Alaska Highway]] is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as \"Highway 1A\" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe city [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon|road]] network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Public transit====\n[[File:Trolley with flags (7041438277).jpg|thumb|The [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] was a [[heritage streetcar]] service that operated from 2000 to 2018.]]\n[[Whitehorse Transit]] provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours.\n\n{{main|Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley}}\nThere was a waterfront tram, known as [[Whitehorse trolley|the \"trolley\"]], which provided transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it was chiefly tourist-oriented and is not integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on the south end of the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station. Whitehorse presently has no active railway service. The trolley system runs on a small portion of the tracks formerly belonging to [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\nThe last scheduled service to Whitehorse from White Pass Railway occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]], with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Water====\nThe Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the [[Bering Sea]]. At {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Highest attainable by transportation|highest point on earth]] that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea. Currently, no passenger or freight services use the river at Whitehorse.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Other services===\nWater disposal is mostly done by draining in a septic tank where the sewage is not that well developed. Waste is disposed mostly in areas requiring reclamation.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900.

Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

The [[White Horse Rapids|rapids]] which were the namesake of the city have disappeared under [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]] and [[Schwatka Lake]], formed by the construction of a hydroelectricity dam in 1958. Whitehorse is currently the [[List of the 100 largest cities and towns in Canada by area|64th]] largest city in Canada by area.

According to [[Meteorological Service of Canada]], Whitehorse has the distinction of being Canada's driest city, mainly because it lies in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Coast Mountains]]. Whitehorse is in the Cordilleran climate region, the Complex Soils of Mountain Areas soil region, the Cordilleran vegetation region, and the Boreal Cordillera ecozone.\n\nIn 2019, Whitehorse recorded

Observing a source using multiple methods is known as [[multi-messenger astronomy]].\n\n[[File:La Silla Poses for an Ultra HD Shoot.jpg|thumb|250px|Ultra HD photography taken at [[La Silla Observatory]].<ref>{{cite news|title=La Silla Poses for an Ultra HD Shoot|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1415a/|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref> ]]\n\nOptical and radio astronomy can be performed with ground-based observatories, because the atmosphere is relatively transparent at the wavelengths being detected. Observatories are usually located at high altitudes so as to minimise the absorption and distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere. Some wavelengths of infrared light are heavily absorbed by [[water vapor]], so many infrared observatories are located in dry places at high altitude, or in space.\n\nThe atmosphere is opaque at the wavelengths used by X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, UV astronomy and (except for a few wavelength \"windows\") [[far infrared astronomy]], so observations must be carried out mostly from [[balloon]]s or space observatories. Powerful gamma rays can, however be detected by the large [[air shower (physics)|air shower]]s they produce, and the study of cosmic rays is a rapidly expanding branch of astronomy.\n\n=== Important factors ===\nFor much of the history of observational astronomy, almost all observation was performed in the visual spectrum with [[optical telescope]]s. While the Earth's atmosphere is relatively transparent in this portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], most telescope work is still dependent on [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions and air transparency, and is generally restricted to the night time. The seeing conditions depend on the turbulence and thermal variations in the air. Locations that are frequently cloudy or suffer from atmospheric turbulence limit the resolution of observations. Likewise the presence of the full [[Moon]] can brighten up the sky with scattered light, hindering observation of faint objects.\n[[Image:MaunaKeaSunset.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sunset over Mauna Kea Observatories.]]\nFor observation purposes, the optimal location for an optical telescope is undoubtedly in [[outer space]]. There the telescope can make observations without being affected by the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, at present it remains costly to lift telescopes into [[orbit]]. Thus the next best locations are certain mountain peaks that have a high number of cloudless days and generally possess good atmospheric conditions (with good [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions). The peaks of the islands of [[Mauna Kea Observatory|Mauna Kea, Hawaii]] and [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|La Palma]] possess these properties, as to a lesser extent do inland sites such as [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory|Llano de Chajnantor]], [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory|Cerro Tololo]] and [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] in [[Chile]]. These observatory locations have attracted an assemblage of powerful telescopes, totalling many billion US dollars of investment.\n\nThe darkness of the night sky is an important factor in optical astronomy. With the size of cities and human populated areas ever expanding, the amount of artificial light at night has also increased. These artificial lights produce a diffuse background illumination that makes observation of faint astronomical features very difficult without special filters. In a few locations such as the state of [[Arizona]] and in the [[United Kingdom]], this has led to campaigns for the reduction of [[light pollution]]. The use of hoods around street lights not only improves the amount of light directed toward the ground, but also helps reduce the light directed toward the sky.\n\nAtmospheric effects ([[astronomical seeing]]) can severely hinder the [[Angular resolution|resolution]] of a telescope. Without some means of correcting for the blurring effect of the shifting atmosphere, telescopes larger than about 15\u201320&nbsp;cm in [[aperture]] can not achieve their theoretical resolution at visible wavelengths. As a result, the primary benefit of using very large telescopes has been the improved light-gathering capability, allowing very faint magnitudes to be observed. However the resolution handicap has begun to be overcome by [[adaptive optics]], [[speckle imaging]] and [[aperture synthesis|interferometric imaging]], as well as the use of [[space telescope]]s.\n\n=== Measuring results ===\nAstronomers have a number of observational tools that they can use to make measurements of the heavens. For objects that are relatively close to the Sun and Earth, direct and very precise [[astrometric|position measurements]] can be made against a more distant (and thereby nearly stationary) background. Early observations of this nature were used to develop very precise orbital models of the various planets, and to determine their respective masses and gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s. Such measurements led to the discovery of the planets [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and (indirectly) [[Pluto]]. They also resulted in an erroneous assumption of a fictional planet [[Vulcan (planet)|Vulcan]] within the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (but the explanation of the [[precession]] of Mercury's orbit by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] is considered one of the triumphs of his [[general relativity]] theory).\n\n== Developments and diversity ==\n[[File:Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] is the world's most powerful telescope for studying the Universe at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths.<ref>{{cite news|title=Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1315a/|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref> ]]\n\nIn addition to examination of the universe in the optical spectrum, astronomers have increasingly been able to acquire information in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The earliest such non-optical measurements were made of the thermal properties of the [[Sun]]. Instruments employed during a solar eclipse could be used to measure the radiation from the [[solar corona|corona]].\n\n[[Image:Green Bank Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Green Bank Telescope|Fully-steerable radio telescope]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]].]]\n\n=== Radio astronomy ===\nWith the discovery of [[radio]] waves, [[radio astronomy]] began to emerge as a new discipline in astronomy. The long wavelengths of radio waves required much larger collecting dishes in order to make images with good resolution, and later led to the development of the multi-dish [[interferometer]] for making high-resolution [[aperture synthesis]] radio images (or \"radio maps\"). The development of the microwave horn receiver led to the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] associated with the [[Big Bang]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dicke|first=R. H.|last2=Peebles|first2=P. J. E.|last3=Roll|first3=P. G.|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D. T.|date=July 1965|title=Cosmic Black-Body Radiation.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=142|pages=414\u2013419|doi=10.1086/148306|issn=0004-637X|bibcode=1965ApJ...142..414D}}</ref>\n\nRadio astronomy has continued to expand its capabilities, even using [[HALCA|radio astronomy satellites]] to produce interferometers with baselines much larger than the size of the Earth. However, the ever-expanding use of the radio spectrum for other uses is gradually drowning out the faint radio signals from the stars. For this reason, in the future radio astronomy might be performed from shielded locations, such as the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]].\n\n=== Late 20th-century developments ===\nThe last part of the twentieth century saw rapid technological advances in astronomical instrumentation. Optical telescopes were growing ever larger, and employing [[adaptive optics]] to partly negate atmospheric blurring. New telescopes were launched into space, and began observing the universe in the [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], [[x-ray]], and [[gamma ray]] parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as observing [[cosmic ray]]s. Interferometer arrays produced the first extremely high-resolution images using [[aperture synthesis]] at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths. Orbiting instruments such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] produced rapid advances in astronomical knowledge, acting as the workhorse for visible-light observations of faint objects. New space instruments under development are expected to directly observe planets around other stars, perhaps even some Earth-like worlds.\n\nIn addition to telescopes, astronomers have begun using other instruments to make observations.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\n[[Neutrino astronomy]] is the branch of astronomy that observes astronomical objects with [[neutrino detector]]s in special observatories, usually huge underground tanks. [[Nuclear reaction]]s in stars and [[supernova]] explosions produce very large numbers of [[neutrino]]s, a very few of which may be detected by a [[neutrino telescope]]. Neutrino astronomy is motivated by the possibility of observing processes that are inaccessible to [[telescope|optical telescope]]s, such as the [[Solar core|Sun's core]].\n\n[[Gravitational wave]] detectors are being designed that may capture events such as collisions of massive objects such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planning for a bright tomorrow: Prospects for gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo|url=http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-ObservingScenario/index.php|publisher=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Robot]]ic [[spacecraft]] are also being increasingly used to make highly detailed observations of [[planet]]s within the [[Solar System]], so that the field of [[planetary science]] now has significant cross-over with the disciplines of [[geology]] and [[meteorology]].\n\n== Observation tools ==\n[[Image:Observat\u00f3rium Skalnat\u00e9 pleso 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Skalnat\u00e9 pleso observatory]], [[Slovakia]].]]\n\n[[File:Quito Observatory 04.JPG|thumb|One of the Oldest Observatories in [[South America]] is the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]], founded in 1873 and located 12 minutes south of the [[Equator]] in Quito, Ecuador.  The Quito Astronomical Observatory is the National Observatory of Ecuador and is located in the Historic Center of Quito and is managed by the [[National Polytechnic School]].<ref>[http://oaq.epn.edu.ec/   The [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is managed by [[National Polytechnic School]], EPN, official web site.   ]</ref>]]\n\n=== Telescopes ===\n[[File:Starwatching.jpg|thumb|200px|An amateur astrophotography setup with an automated guide system connected to a laptop.]]\nThe key instrument of nearly all modern observational astronomy is the [[telescope]]. This serves the dual purposes of gathering more light so that very faint objects can be observed, and magnifying the image so that small and distant objects can be observed. Optical astronomy requires telescopes that use optical components of great precision. Typical requirements for grinding and polishing a curved mirror, for example, require the surface to be within a fraction of a wavelength of light of a particular [[cone (geometry)|conic]] shape. Many modern \"telescopes\" actually consist of arrays of telescopes working together to provide higher resolution through [[aperture synthesis]].\n\nLarge telescopes are housed in domes, both to protect them from the weather and to stabilize the environmental conditions.  For example, if the temperature is different from one side of the telescope to the other, the shape of the structure changes, due to [[thermal expansion]] pushing optical elements out of position. This can affect the image.  For this reason, the domes are usually bright white ([[titanium dioxide]]) or unpainted metal.  Domes are often opened around sunset, long before observing can begin, so that air can circulate and bring the entire telescope to the same temperature as the surroundings.  To prevent wind-buffet or other vibrations affecting observations, it is standard practice to mount the telescope on a concrete pier whose foundations are entirely separate from those of the surrounding dome and building.\n\nTo do almost any scientific work requires that telescopes track objects as they wheel across the visible sky.  In other words, they must smoothly compensate for the rotation of the Earth.  Until the advent of [[computer]] controlled drive mechanisms, the standard solution was some form of [[equatorial mount]], and for small telescopes this is still the norm.   However, this is a structurally poor design and becomes more and more cumbersome as the diameter and weight of the telescope increases.  The world's largest equatorial mounted telescope is the 200 inch (5.1 m) [[Hale Telescope]], whereas recent 8\u201310 m telescopes use the structurally better [[altazimuth mount]], and are actually physically ''smaller'' than the Hale, despite the larger mirrors.  As of 2006, there are design projects underway for gigantic alt-az telescopes: the Thirty Metre Telescope [https://web.archive.org/web/20150130044644/http://lot.astro.utoronto.ca/], and the 100 m diameter [[Overwhelmingly Large Telescope]].<ref>[http://www.eso.org/projects/owl The ESO 100-m OWL optical telescope concept]</ref>\n\nAmateur astronomers use such instruments as the [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]], the [[Refracting telescope|Refractor]] and the increasingly popular  [[Maksutov telescope]].\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe [[photograph]] has served a critical role in observational astronomy for over a century, but in the last 30 years it has been largely replaced for imaging applications by digital sensors such as [[charge-coupled device|CCD]]s and [[CMOS]] chips. Specialist areas of astronomy such as photometry and interferometry have utilised electronic detectors for a much longer period of time. [[Astrophotography]] uses specialised [[photographic film]] (or usually a glass plate coated with photographic [[emulsion]]), but there are a number of drawbacks, particularly a low [[quantum efficiency]], of the order of 3%, whereas CCDs can be tuned for a QE >90% in a narrow band.  Almost all modern telescope instruments are electronic arrays, and older telescopes have been either been retrofitted with these instruments or closed down.  Glass plates are still used in some applications, such as surveying,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} because the resolution possible with a chemical film is much higher than any electronic detector yet constructed.\n\n==== Advantages ====\nPrior to the invention of photography, all astronomy was done with the naked eye.  However, even before films became sensitive enough, scientific astronomy moved entirely to film, because of the overwhelming advantages:\n* The human eye discards what it sees from split-second to split-second, but photographic film gathers more and more light for as long as the shutter is open.\n* The resulting image is permanent, so many astronomers can use the same data.\n* It is possible to see objects as they change over time ([[SN 1987A]] is a spectacular example).\n\n==== Blink comparator ====\nThe [[blink comparator]] is an instrument that is used to compare two nearly identical photographs made of the same section of sky at different points in time. The comparator alternates illumination of the two plates, and any changes are revealed by blinking points or streaks. This instrument has been used to find [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[variable star]]s.\n[[File:Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|160px|50 cm refracting telescope at [[Nice Observatory]].]]\n\n=== Micrometer ===\nThe position or cross-wire [[micrometer]] is an implement that has been used to measure [[double star]]s. This consists of a pair of fine, movable lines that can be moved together or apart. The telescope lens is lined up on the pair and oriented using position wires that lie at right angles to the star separation. The movable wires are then adjusted to match the two star positions. The separation of the stars is then read off the instrument, and their true separation determined based on the magnification of the instrument.\n\n=== Spectrograph ===\nA vital instrument of observational astronomy is the [[spectroscope|spectrograph]]. The absorption of specific wavelengths of light by elements allows specific properties of distant bodies to be observed. This capability has resulted in the discovery of the element of [[helium]] in the Sun's [[emission spectrum]], and has allowed astronomers to determine a great deal of information concerning distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. [[Doppler shift]] (particularly \"[[redshift]]\") of spectra can also be used to determine the radial motion or distance with respect to the [[Earth]].\n\nEarly spectrographs employed banks of [[prism (optics)|prism]]s that split light into a broad spectrum. Later the [[diffraction grating|grating spectrograph]] was developed, which reduced the amount of light loss compared to prisms and provided higher spectral resolution. The spectrum can be photographed in a long exposure, allowing the spectrum of faint objects (such as distant galaxies) to be measured.\n\nStellar photometry came into use in 1861 as a means of measuring [[color index|stellar colors]]. This technique measured the magnitude of a star at specific frequency ranges, allowing a determination of the overall color, and therefore [[temperature]] of a star. By 1951 an internationally standardized system of UBV-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] (''U''ltraviolet-''B''lue-''V''isual) was adopted.\n\n=== Photoelectric photometry ===\n[[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric]] [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] using the [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] is now frequently used to make observations through a telescope. These sensitive instruments can record the image nearly down to the level of individual [[photon]]s, and can be designed to view in parts of the spectrum that are invisible to the eye. The ability to record the arrival of small numbers of photons over a period of time can allow a degree of computer correction for atmospheric effects, sharpening up the image. Multiple digital images can also be combined to further enhance the image. When combined with the [[adaptive optics]] technology, image quality can approach the theoretical resolution capability of the telescope.\n\n[[Filter (optics)|Filter]]s are used to view an object at particular frequencies or frequency ranges. [[Optical coating|Multilayer film]] filters can provide very precise control of the frequencies transmitted and blocked, so that, for example, objects can be viewed at a particular frequency emitted only by excited [[hydrogen]] atoms. Filters can also be used to partially compensate for the effects of [[light pollution]] by blocking out unwanted light. [[Polarization in astronomy|Polarization filters]] can also be used to determine if a source is emitting polarized light, and the orientation of the polarization.\n\n== Observing ==\n[[File:The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla.jpg|thumb|The main platform at [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] hosts a huge range of telescopes with which astronomers can explore the Universe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1546a/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>]]\n\nAstronomers observe a wide range of astronomical sources, including high-redshift galaxies, [[active galaxy|AGNs]], the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|afterglow from the Big Bang]] and many different types of stars and protostars.\n\nA variety of data can be observed for each object. The position [[coordinate]]s locate the object on the sky using the techniques of [[spherical astronomy]], and the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] determines its brightness as seen from the [[Earth]]. The relative brightness in different parts of the spectrum yields information about the [[temperature]] and physics of the object. Photographs of the spectra allow the chemistry of the object to be examined.\n\n[[Parallax]] shifts of a star against the background can be used to determine the distance, out to a limit imposed by the resolution of the instrument. The [[radial velocity]] of the star and changes in its position over time ([[proper motion]]) can be used to measure its velocity relative to the Sun. Variations in the brightness of the star give evidence of instabilities in the star's atmosphere, or else the presence of an occulting companion. The orbits of binary stars can be used to measure the relative masses of each companion, or the total mass of the system. Spectroscopic binaries can be found by observing [[doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of the star and its close companion.\n\nStars of identical masses that formed at the same time and under similar conditions typically have nearly identical observed properties. Observing a mass of closely associated stars, such as in a [[globular cluster]], allows data to be assembled about the distribution of stellar types. These tables can then be used to infer the age of the association.\n\nFor distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[active galaxy|AGNs]] observations are made of the overall shape and properties of the galaxy, as well as the [[groups and clusters of galaxies|groupings]] where they are found. Observations of certain types of [[Cepheid variable|variable star]]s and [[supernova#Type 1a|supernova]]e of known [[luminosity]], called [[standard candle]]s, in other galaxies allows the inference of the distance to the host galaxy. The expansion of space causes the spectra of these galaxies to be shifted, depending on the distance, and modified by the [[Doppler effect]] of the galaxy's radial velocity. Both the size of the galaxy and its [[redshift]] can be used to infer something about the distance of the galaxy. Observations of large numbers of galaxies are referred to as [[redshift survey]]s, and are used to model the evolution of galaxy forms.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Astronomy}}\n* [[Lunar observation]]\n* [[Observational study]]\n* [[Observatory]]\n* [[Space telescope]]\n* [[Timeline of telescopes, observatories, and observing technology]]\n\n== Related lists ==\n* [[List of astronomical observatories]]\n* [[List of radio telescopes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://bibnum.obspm.fr Archives and iconography] from 17th century preserved by the [[Paris Observatory]] library\n{{Wikiversity}}\n{{Commons category-inline|Observational astronomy}}\n\n{{Astronomy navbox|state=expanded}}\n{{Galileo Galilei}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Observational Astronomy}}\n[[Category:Observational astronomy| ]]\n[[Category:Scientific observation]]\n[[Category:Astronomical sub-disciplines]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n[[File:Mayall Telescope.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nicholas U.

Without some means of correcting for the blurring effect of the shifting atmosphere, telescopes larger than about 15\u201320&nbsp;cm in [[aperture]] can not achieve their theoretical resolution at visible wavelengths. As a result, the primary benefit of using very large telescopes has been the improved light-gathering capability, allowing very faint magnitudes to be observed. However the resolution handicap has begun to be overcome by [[adaptive optics]], [[speckle imaging]] and [[aperture synthesis|interferometric imaging]], as well as the use of [[space telescope]]s.\n\n=== Measuring results ===\nAstronomers have a number of observational tools that they can use to make measurements of the heavens. For objects that are relatively close to the Sun and Earth, direct and very precise [[astrometric|position measurements]] can be made against a more distant (and thereby nearly stationary) background. Early observations of this nature were used to develop very precise orbital models of the various planets, and to determine their respective masses and gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s. Such measurements led to the discovery of the planets [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and (indirectly) [[Pluto]]. They also resulted in an erroneous assumption of a fictional planet [[Vulcan (planet)|Vulcan]] within the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (but the explanation of the [[precession]] of Mercury's orbit by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] is considered one of the triumphs of his [[general relativity]] theory).\n\n== Developments and diversity ==\n[[File:Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] is the world's most powerful telescope for studying the Universe at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths.<ref>{{cite news|title=Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1315a/|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref> ]]\n\nIn addition to examination of the universe in the optical spectrum, astronomers have increasingly been able to acquire information in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The earliest such non-optical measurements were made of the thermal properties of the [[Sun]]. Instruments employed during a solar eclipse could be used to measure the radiation from the [[corona]].\n\n[[Image:Green Bank Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Green Bank Telescope|Fully-steerable radio telescope]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]].]]\n\n=== Radio astronomy ===\nWith the discovery of [[radio]] waves, [[radio astronomy]] began to emerge as a new discipline in astronomy. The long wavelengths of radio waves required much larger collecting dishes in order to make images with good resolution, and later led to the development of the multi-dish [[interferometer]] for making high-resolution [[aperture synthesis]] radio images (or \"radio maps\"). The development of the microwave horn receiver led to the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] associated with the [[Big Bang]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dicke|first=R. H.|last2=Peebles|first2=P. J. E.|last3=Roll|first3=P. G.|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D. T.|date=July 1965|title=Cosmic Black-Body Radiation.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=142|pages=414\u2013419|doi=10.1086/148306|issn=0004-637X|bibcode=1965ApJ...142..414D}}</ref>\n\nRadio astronomy has continued to expand its capabilities, even using [[HALCA|radio astronomy satellites]] to produce interferometers with baselines much larger than the size of the Earth. However, the ever-expanding use of the radio spectrum for other uses is gradually drowning out the faint radio signals from the stars. For this reason, in the future radio astronomy might be performed from shielded locations, such as the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]].\n\n=== Late 20th-century developments ===\nThe last part of the twentieth century saw rapid technological advances in astronomical instrumentation. Optical telescopes were growing ever larger, and employing [[adaptive optics]] to partly negate atmospheric blurring. New telescopes were launched into space, and began observing the universe in the [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], [[x-ray]], and [[gamma ray]] parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as observing [[cosmic ray]]s. Interferometer arrays produced the first extremely high-resolution images using [[aperture synthesis]] at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths. Orbiting instruments such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] produced rapid advances in astronomical knowledge, acting as the workhorse for visible-light observations of faint objects. New space instruments under development are expected to directly observe planets around other stars, perhaps even some Earth-like worlds.\n\nIn addition to telescopes, astronomers have begun using other instruments to make observations.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\n[[Neutrino astronomy]] is the branch of astronomy that observes astronomical objects with [[neutrino detector]]s in special observatories, usually huge underground tanks. [[Nuclear reaction]]s in stars and [[supernova]] explosions produce very large numbers of [[neutrino]]s, a very few of which may be detected by a [[neutrino telescope]]. Neutrino astronomy is motivated by the possibility of observing processes that are inaccessible to [[telescope|optical telescope]]s, such as the [[Solar core|Sun's core]].\n\n[[Gravitational wave]] detectors are being designed that may capture events such as collisions of massive objects such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planning for a bright tomorrow: Prospects for gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo|url=http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-ObservingScenario/index.php|publisher=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Robot]]ic [[spacecraft]] are also being increasingly used to make highly detailed observations of [[planet]]s within the [[Solar System]], so that the field of [[planetary science]] now has significant cross-over with the disciplines of [[geology]] and [[meteorology]].\n\n== Observation tools ==\n[[Image:Observat\u00f3rium Skalnat\u00e9 pleso 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Skalnat\u00e9 pleso observatory]], [[Slovakia]].]]\n\n[[File:Quito Observatory 04.JPG|thumb|One of the Oldest Observatories in [[South America]] is the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]], founded in 1873 and located 12 minutes south of the [[Equator]] in Quito, Ecuador.  The Quito Astronomical Observatory is the National Observatory of Ecuador and is located in the Historic Center of Quito and is managed by the [[National Polytechnic School]].<ref>[http://oaq.epn.edu.ec/   The [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is managed by [[National Polytechnic School]], EPN, official web site.   ]</ref>]]\n\n=== Telescopes ===\n[[File:Starwatching.jpg|thumb|200px|An amateur astrophotography setup with an automated guide system connected to a laptop.]]\nThe key instrument of nearly all modern observational astronomy is the [[telescope]]. This serves the dual purposes of gathering more light so that very faint objects can be observed, and magnifying the image so that small and distant objects can be observed. Optical astronomy requires telescopes that use optical components of great precision. Typical requirements for grinding and polishing a curved mirror, for example, require the surface to be within a fraction of a wavelength of light of a particular [[cone (geometry)|conic]] shape. Many modern \"telescopes\" actually consist of arrays of telescopes working together to provide higher resolution through [[aperture synthesis]].\n\nLarge telescopes are housed in domes, both to protect them from the weather and to stabilize the environmental conditions.  For example, if the temperature is different from one side of the telescope to the other, the shape of the structure changes, due to [[thermal expansion]] pushing optical elements out of position. This can affect the image.  For this reason, the domes are usually bright white ([[titanium dioxide]]) or unpainted metal.  Domes are often opened around sunset, long before observing can begin, so that air can circulate and bring the entire telescope to the same temperature as the surroundings.  To prevent wind-buffet or other vibrations affecting observations, it is standard practice to mount the telescope on a concrete pier whose foundations are entirely separate from those of the surrounding dome and building.\n\nTo do almost any scientific work requires that telescopes track objects as they wheel across the visible sky.  In other words, they must smoothly compensate for the rotation of the Earth.  Until the advent of [[computer]] controlled drive mechanisms, the standard solution was some form of [[equatorial mount]], and for small telescopes this is still the norm.   However, this is a structurally poor design and becomes more and more cumbersome as the diameter and weight of the telescope increases.  The world's largest equatorial mounted telescope is the 200 inch (5.1 m) [[Hale Telescope]], whereas recent 8\u201310 m telescopes use the structurally better [[altazimuth mount]], and are actually physically ''smaller'' than the Hale, despite the larger mirrors.  As of 2006, there are design projects underway for gigantic alt-az telescopes: the Thirty Metre Telescope [https://web.archive.org/web/20150130044644/http://lot.astro.utoronto.ca/], and the 100 m diameter [[Overwhelmingly Large Telescope]].<ref>[http://www.eso.org/projects/owl The ESO 100-m OWL optical telescope concept]</ref>\n\nAmateur astronomers use such instruments as the [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]], the [[Refracting telescope|Refractor]] and the increasingly popular  [[Maksutov telescope]].\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe [[photograph]] has served a critical role in observational astronomy for over a century, but in the last 30 years it has been largely replaced for imaging applications by digital sensors such as [[charge-coupled device|CCD]]s and [[CMOS]] chips. Specialist areas of astronomy such as photometry and interferometry have utilised electronic detectors for a much longer period of time. [[Astrophotography]] uses specialised [[photographic film]] (or usually a glass plate coated with photographic [[emulsion]]), but there are a number of drawbacks, particularly a low [[quantum efficiency]], of the order of 3%, whereas CCDs can be tuned for a QE >90% in a narrow band.  Almost all modern telescope instruments are electronic arrays, and older telescopes have been either been retrofitted with these instruments or closed down.  Glass plates are still used in some applications, such as surveying,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} because the resolution possible with a chemical film is much higher than any electronic detector yet constructed.\n\n==== Advantages ====\nPrior to the invention of photography, all astronomy was done with the naked eye.  However, even before films became sensitive enough, scientific astronomy moved entirely to film, because of the overwhelming advantages:\n* The human eye discards what it sees from split-second to split-second, but photographic film gathers more and more light for as long as the shutter is open.\n* The resulting image is permanent, so many astronomers can use the same data.\n* It is possible to see objects as they change over time ([[SN 1987A]] is a spectacular example).\n\n==== Blink comparator ====\nThe [[blink comparator]] is an instrument that is used to compare two nearly identical photographs made of the same section of sky at different points in time. The comparator alternates illumination of the two plates, and any changes are revealed by blinking points or streaks. This instrument has been used to find [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[variable star]]s.\n[[File:Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|160px|50 cm refracting telescope at [[Nice Observatory]].]]\n\n=== Micrometer ===\nThe position or cross-wire [[micrometer]] is an implement that has been used to measure [[double star]]s. This consists of a pair of fine, movable lines that can be moved together or apart. The telescope lens is lined up on the pair and oriented using position wires that lie at right angles to the star separation. The movable wires are then adjusted to match the two star positions. The separation of the stars is then read off the instrument, and their true separation determined based on the magnification of the instrument.\n\n=== Spectrograph ===\nA vital instrument of observational astronomy is the [[spectroscope|spectrograph]]. The absorption of specific wavelengths of light by elements allows specific properties of distant bodies to be observed. This capability has resulted in the discovery of the element of [[helium]] in the Sun's [[emission spectrum]], and has allowed astronomers to determine a great deal of information concerning distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. [[Doppler shift]] (particularly \"[[redshift]]\") of spectra can also be used to determine the radial motion or distance with respect to the [[Earth]].\n\nEarly spectrographs employed banks of [[prism (optics)|prism]]s that split light into a broad spectrum. Later the [[diffraction grating|grating spectrograph]] was developed, which reduced the amount of light loss compared to prisms and provided higher spectral resolution. The spectrum can be photographed in a long exposure, allowing the spectrum of faint objects (such as distant galaxies) to be measured.\n\nStellar photometry came into use in 1861 as a means of measuring [[color index|stellar colors]]. This technique measured the magnitude of a star at specific frequency ranges, allowing a determination of the overall color, and therefore [[temperature]] of a star. By 1951 an internationally standardized system of UBV-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] (''U''ltraviolet-''B''lue-''V''isual) was adopted.\n\n=== Photoelectric photometry ===\n[[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric]] [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] using the [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] is now frequently used to make observations through a telescope. These sensitive instruments can record the image nearly down to the level of individual [[photon]]s, and can be designed to view in parts of the spectrum that are invisible to the eye. The ability to record the arrival of small numbers of photons over a period of time can allow a degree of computer correction for atmospheric effects, sharpening up the image. Multiple digital images can also be combined to further enhance the image. When combined with the [[adaptive optics]] technology, image quality can approach the theoretical resolution capability of the telescope.\n\n[[Filter (optics)|Filter]]s are used to view an object at particular frequencies or frequency ranges. [[Optical coating|Multilayer film]] filters can provide very precise control of the frequencies transmitted and blocked, so that, for example, objects can be viewed at a particular frequency emitted only by excited [[hydrogen]] atoms. Filters can also be used to partially compensate for the effects of [[light pollution]] by blocking out unwanted light. [[Polarization in astronomy|Polarization filters]] can also be used to determine if a source is emitting polarized light, and the orientation of the polarization.\n\n== Observing ==\n[[File:The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla.jpg|thumb|The main platform at [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] hosts a huge range of telescopes with which astronomers can explore the Universe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1546a/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>]]\n\nAstronomers observe a wide range of astronomical sources, including high-redshift galaxies, [[active galaxy|AGNs]], the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|afterglow from the Big Bang]] and many different types of stars and protostars.\n\nA variety of data can be observed for each object. The position [[coordinate]]s locate the object on the sky using the techniques of [[spherical astronomy]], and the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] determines its brightness as seen from the [[Earth]]. The relative brightness in different parts of the spectrum yields information about the [[temperature]] and physics of the object. Photographs of the spectra allow the chemistry of the object to be examined.\n\n[[Parallax]] shifts of a star against the background can be used to determine the distance, out to a limit imposed by the resolution of the instrument. The [[radial velocity]] of the star and changes in its position over time ([[proper motion]]) can be used to measure its velocity relative to the Sun. Variations in the brightness of the star give evidence of instabilities in the star's atmosphere, or else the presence of an occulting companion. The orbits of binary stars can be used to measure the relative masses of each companion, or the total mass of the system. Spectroscopic binaries can be found by observing [[doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of the star and its close companion.\n\nStars of identical masses that formed at the same time and under similar conditions typically have nearly identical observed properties. Observing a mass of closely associated stars, such as in a [[globular cluster]], allows data to be assembled about the distribution of stellar types. These tables can then be used to infer the age of the association.\n\nFor distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[active galaxy|AGNs]] observations are made of the overall shape and properties of the galaxy, as well as the [[groups and clusters of galaxies|groupings]] where they are found. Observations of certain types of [[Cepheid variable|variable star]]s and [[supernova#Type 1a|supernova]]e of known [[luminosity]], called [[standard candle]]s, in other galaxies allows the inference of the distance to the host galaxy. The expansion of space causes the spectra of these galaxies to be shifted, depending on the distance, and modified by the [[Doppler effect]] of the galaxy's radial velocity. Both the size of the galaxy and its [[redshift]] can be used to infer something about the distance of the galaxy. Observations of large numbers of galaxies are referred to as [[redshift survey]]s, and are used to model the evolution of galaxy forms.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Astronomy}}\n* [[Lunar observation]]\n* [[Observational study]]\n* [[Observatory]]\n* [[Space telescope]]\n* [[Timeline of telescopes, observatories, and observing technology]]\n\n== Related lists ==\n* [[List of astronomical observatories]]\n* [[List of radio telescopes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://bibnum.obspm.fr Archives and iconography] from 17th century preserved by the [[Paris Observatory]] library\n{{Wikiversity}}\n{{Commonscat-inline|Observational astronomy}}\n\n{{Astronomy navbox|state=expanded}}\n{{Galileo Galilei}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Observational Astronomy}}\n[[Category:Observational astronomy| ]]\n[[Category:Scientific observation]]\n[[Category:Astronomical sub-disciplines]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy"}

The show is co-presented with his former ''Top Gear'' co-hosts, Clarkson and May, as an exclusive distributed via [[Prime Video|Amazon Video]] to [[Amazon Prime]] customers.  \n\nIn November 2016, Hammond, alongside the co-presenters of ''[[The Grand Tour]]'', Jeremy Clarkson and James May, launched the automotive social media website [[DriveTribe]], where he regularly provides content on his tribe \"Hammond's Fob Jockeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://drivetribe.com/t/VXlDRsr_Sy-uZOvUQgQqBg?iid=G6q5v9TgRRubihgUmtAq3g|title=Hammond's Fob Jockeys|publisher=drivetribe.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>  He has also presented ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]'' (2003\u20132008), ''[[Total Wipeout]]'' (2009\u20132012) and ''[[Planet Earth Live (TV series)|Planet Earth Live]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Mark Hammond was born on 19 December 1969 in [[Solihull]], [[Warwickshire]], and is the grandson of workers in the [[Birmingham]] car industry.<ref name=\"Hammond, Richard 2007\">{{cite book|author=Hammond, Richard|title=On The Edge: My Story|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-297-85327-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/exclusions/familyhistory/fd100207.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|title=Family detective: Richard Hammond|first=Nick|last=Barratt|date=12 April 2008|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In the mid-1980s Hammond moved with his family (mother Eileen, father Alan, and younger brothers Andrew, writer of the 'Crypt' series, and Nicholas) to the [[North Yorkshire]] cathedral city of [[Ripon]] where his father ran a [[probate]] business in the market square. He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Solihull's Sharmans Cross district from the age of 3\u20137. Originally a pupil of [[Solihull School]], a fee-paying boys' independent school, he moved to [[Ripon Grammar School]], and from 1986 to 1988 attended [[Harrogate College|Harrogate College of Art and Technology]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduation, Hammond worked for several BBC radio stations, including [[BBC Tees|Radio Cleveland]], [[BBC Radio York|Radio York]], [[BBC Radio Cumbria|Radio Cumbria]], [[BBC Radio Leeds|Radio Leeds]] and [[BBC Newcastle|Radio Newcastle]].<ref name=BBCAus/>\n\nPresenting the afternoon programme at [[BBC Radio Lancashire|Radio Lancashire]], his regular guests included motoring journalist [[Zogg Zieglar]], who would review a car of the week by being interviewed by Hammond over the phone.

The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause.

Oliver features on Hammond's children's science television show ''[[Richard Hammond's Blast Lab]]'' and in another episode of ''Top Gear'' as a kind of \"Hill-holder\" in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the fake personal plate \"OLI V3R\").
