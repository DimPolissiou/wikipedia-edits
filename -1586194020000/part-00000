Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands\u2014[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]]\u2014as well as outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign.\n\nThe title was unveiled by [[Mick Foley]] on the May 20, 2019 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', where [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a 24/7 rule.

[[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995).

It is a tertiary championship open to anyone\u2014regardless of gender or WWE employment status\u2014and carries the special rule that it can be defended \"[[24/7]]\", as in any time, [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|anywhere]], as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands\u2014[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]]\u2014as well as outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign.\n\nThe title was unveiled by [[Mick Foley]] on the May 20, 2019 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', where [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a 24/7 rule. This rule can be temporarily suspended by an authority figure, usually done during a scheduled match for the title or matches that involve the champion.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Titus O'Neal 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Inaugural 24/7 Champion [[Titus O'Neil]]]]\nDuring the [[Money in the Bank (2019)|2019 Money in the Bank]] pay-per-view on May 19, [[WWE]] announced that a new championship would be introduced on the following night's episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'',<ref name=\"MITB2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=WWE Money in the Bank results: Powell's live review of Seth Rollins vs. AJ Styles for the WWE Universal Championship, Kofi Kingston vs. Kevin Owens for the WWE Championship, Becky Lynch defends the Raw and Smackdown Women's Titles, two Money in the Bank ladder matches|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/19/wwe-money-in-the-bank-results-powells-live-review-of-seth-rollins-vs-aj-styles-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-kofi-kingston-vs-kevin-owens-for-the-wwe-championship-becky-lynch-defends-the-r/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 19, 2019|date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> where hardcore legend and [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Mick Foley]] unveiled the WWE 24/7 Championship.

He also said that WWE legends could return and challenge for the title. After the unveiling, Foley laid the title belt in the ring and said that whoever secured the championship first in a scramble would become the inaugural champion. Raw's [[Titus O'Neil]] became the inaugural champion by doing so, defeating [[Cedric Alexander]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Ethan Carter III|EC3]], [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]], [[Karl Anderson]], [[Luke Gallows]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and [[No Way Jose (wrestler)|No Way Jose]] to claim the championship.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/126603/wwes-newest-championship-is.html?p=1|title=WWE'S NEWEST CHAMPIONSHIP IS...|last=Johnson|first=Mike|publisher=PWInsider|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"24/7belt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/new-24-7-title-unveiling-video/#.XONkdS2ZNQI|title=WATCH: Mick Foley Unveils New WWE 24/7 Title, First Champion Crowned|last=Satin|first=Ryan|work=Pro Wrestling Sheet|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Raw05202019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2019/05/20/5-20-wwe-raw-results-kellers-report-on-money-in-the-bank-fallout-will-brock-lesnar-announce-his-intensions-mick-foley-reveals-new-wwe-title/|title=5/20 WWE Raw Results: Keller's report on Money in the Bank fallout, will Brock Lesnar announce his intensions, Mick Foley reveals new WWE Title|date=May 20, 2019|last=Keller|first=Wade|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 21, 2019}}</ref> It was later confirmed that the title was not gender-exclusive and could also be won by non-WWE personnel after the respective wins of former female wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] and [[Fox Sports|Fox]] sportscaster [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]].<ref name=\"Raw07222019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/07/22/7-22-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-raw-reunion-featuring-steve-austin-ric-flair-dx-hulk-hogan-and-many-more-alexa-bliss-talkshow-with-becky-lynch-the-build-to-summerslam-continues/|title=7/22 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review Raw Reunion featuring Steve Austin, Ric Flair, DX, Hulk Hogan, and many more, Alexa Bliss talkshow with Becky Lynch, the build to SummerSlam continues|date=July 22, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"FOX Founders Day\">{{cite web|last=Tedesco|first=Mike|title=WWE 24/7 Championship changes hands multiple times at FOX Founders Day event|url=https://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/136429-wwe-24-7-championship-changes-hands-multiple-times-at-fox-founders-day-event/|work=WrestleView|date=August 24, 2019|accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough a stipulation of the championship, the 24/7 rule can be temporarily suspended by an authority figure. This usually occurs when the champion is involved in a non-title match. For example, after [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] won the title from [[R-Truth]] on the May 28, 2019 episode of ''[[SmackDown Live]]'', [[Shane McMahon]] suspended the rule until after the scheduled tag team match later that same night, in which both Elias and Truth were involved.<ref name=\"SmackDown05282019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/28/5-28-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-kofi-kingston-vs-kevin-owens-in-a-non-title-match-bayley-vs-lacey-evans-in-a-non-title-match-dolph-ziggler-on-the-kevin-owens-show/|title=5/28 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of Kofi Kingston vs. Kevin Owens in a non-title match, Bayley vs. Lacey Evans in a non-title match, Dolph Ziggler on the Kevin Owens Show|date=May 28, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=June 19, 2019}}</ref> The rule can also be suspended during an actual scheduled match for the title to prevent other wrestlers from getting involved.

[[R-Truth]] has the most reigns at 35 and the longest combined reign at 165 days (152 days as recognized by WWE). [[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions. Non-wrestlers to have held the title include [[Fox Sports|Fox]] sportscaster [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]], NBA player Enes Kanter, [[electronic music]] producer/[[disc jockey]] [[Marshmello]], WWE Senior Account Manager Michael Giaccio, [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Busch]], and ''Raw'' announcer Mike Rome.<ref name=OfficialTitleHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/24-7-championship|title=24/7 Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign.
