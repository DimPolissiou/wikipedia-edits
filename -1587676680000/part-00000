It also owns important American art, Old Masters, European and American decorative arts, Asian art and modern and contemporary art. The '''Art Institute of Chicago''', founded in 1879 and located in [[Chicago]]'s [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], is one of the oldest and [[list of largest art museums|largest]] art museums in the United States.

Its permanent collection of nearly 300,000 works of art is augmented by more than 30 special exhibitions mounted yearly that illuminate aspects of the collection and present cutting-edge curatorial and scientific research.\n\nAs a research institution, the Art Institute also has a conservation and conservation science department, five conservation laboratories, and one of the largest art history and architecture libraries in the country\u2014the [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries|Ryerson and Burnham Libraries]].\n\nThe growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's original 1893 building, which was constructed for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of the same year. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by [[Renzo Piano]], opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet, making it the [[List of largest art museums in the world|second-largest]] art museum in the United States, after the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"second-largest\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/arts/design/14inst.html?ref=design| title=A Grand and Intimate Modern Art Trove| date=13 May 2009| work=The New York Times| first=Roberta| last=Smith| accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> The Art Institute is associated with the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], a leading art school, making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States.\n\n==History==\nIn 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the '''Chicago Academy of Design''' in a studio on Dearborn Street, with the intent to run a free school with its art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the [[Royal Academy]], with Academicians and Associate Academicians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.\n\nClasses started in 1868, meeting every day at a cost of $10 per month. The Academy's success enabled it to build a new home for the school, a five-story stone building on 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.\n\nWhen the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy was thrown into debt. Attempts to continue despite the loss by using rented facilities failed. By 1878, the Academy was $10,000 in debt. Members tried to rescue the ailing institution by making deals with local businessmen, before some finally abandoned it in 1879 to found a new organization, named the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets at auction.\n[[File: Art Institute 1893.gif|thumb|left|This 1893 sketch of the then-new Art Institute of Chicago shows most of today's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] still submerged under Lake Michigan, with the railroad tracks running along the shoreline behind the Museum]]\nIn 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current '''Art Institute of Chicago''' and elected as its first president the banker and philanthropist [[Charles L.

The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were met by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893, the Institute moved into the new building.

As \"one of the most respected museum leaders in the country\", as described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wood created major exhibitions of works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] that set records for attendance at the museum.

Because works on paper are sensitive to light and degrade quickly, the works are on display infrequently to keep them in good condition for as long as possible.\n\n=== Textiles ===\nThe Department of Textiles has more than 13,000 textiles and 66,000 sample swatches in total, covering an array of cultures from 300 B.C. to the present.

The lions were unveiled on May 10, 1894, each weighing more than two tons. The sculptor gave them unofficial names: the south lion is \"stands in an attitude of defiance\", and the north lion is \"on the prowl\". When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (i.e. the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.\n\nThe east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance to the old [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]. Designed by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1894, the Exchange was torn down in 1972, but salvaged portions of the original trading room were brought to the Art Institute and reconstructed.\n\nThe Art Institute building has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect the east and west buildings while the [[Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During the renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.\n\n===Libraries===\n[[File: Burnham Library Simon Fieldhouse 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries|Burnham Library]] was founded in 1912]]Located on the ground floor of the museum is the [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries]].

The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the [[Royal Academy]], with Academicians and Associate Academicians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.\n\nClasses started in 1868, meeting every day at a cost of $10 per month. The Academy's success enabled it to build a new home for the school, a five-story stone building on 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.\n\nWhen the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy was thrown into debt. Attempts to continue despite the loss by using rented facilities failed. By 1878, the Academy was $10,000 in debt. Members tried to rescue the ailing institution by making deals with local businessmen, before some finally abandoned it in 1879 to found a new organization, named the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets at auction.\n[[File:Art Institute 1893.gif|thumb|left|This 1893 sketch of the then new Art Institute of Chicago shows most of today's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] still submerged under Lake Michigan, with the railroad tracks running along the shoreline behind the Museum]]\nIn 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current '''Art Institute of Chicago''' and elected as its first president the banker and philanthropist [[Charles L.

The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were met by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893, the Institute moved into the new building.

The lions were unveiled on May 10, 1894, each weighing more than two tons. The sculptor gave them unofficial names: the south lion is \"stands in an attitude of defiance\", and the north lion is \"on the prowl\". When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (i.e. the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.\n\nThe east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance to the old [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]. Designed by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1894, the Exchange was torn down in 1972, but salvaged portions of the original trading room were brought to the Art Institute and reconstructed.\n\nThe Art Institute building has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect the east and west buildings while the [[Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.\n\n===Libraries===\n[[File:Burnham Library Simon Fieldhouse 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries|Burnham Library]] was founded in 1912]]Located on the ground floor of the museum is the [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries]].

It is also called a '''moving mean''' ('''MM''')<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/cmnt091412/sldmwa/booth_et_al_2006.pdf Hydrologic Variability of the Cosumnes River Floodplain] (Booth et al., San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2006)</ref> or '''rolling mean''' and is a type of [[finite impulse response]] filter. Variations include: [[#Simple moving average|simple]], and [[#Cumulative moving average|cumulative]], or [[#Weighted moving average|weighted]] forms (described below).\n\nGiven a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by \"shifting forward\"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.\n\nA moving average is commonly used with [[time series]] data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.  The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly.  For example, it is often used in [[technical analysis]] of financial data, like stock [[price]]s, [[return (finance)|returns]] or trading volumes.  It is also used in [[economics]] to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series.  Mathematically, a moving average is a type of [[convolution]] and so it can be viewed as an example of a [[low-pass filter]] used in [[signal processing]].  When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.\n\n==Simple moving average==\n[[File:Moving Average Types comparison - Simple and Exponential.png|thumb]]\nIn financial applications a '''simple moving average''' ('''SMA''') is the unweighted [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the previous ''n'' data. However, in science and engineering, the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data on either side of a central value. This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the data rather than being shifted in time.\n{{Anchor|algorithm}}\nAn example of a simple equally weighted running mean for a ''n''-day sample of closing price is the mean of the previous ''n'' days' closing prices. If those prices are <math>p_M, p_{M-1}, \\dots, p_{M-(n-1)}</math> then the formula is\n<!--\nthis used to be a hairy sigma style with i's and j's, but prefer dots since it's a lot easier for financial people with limited math -->\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\overline{p}_\\text{SM} &= \\frac{p_M + p_{M-1} + \\cdots + p_{M-(n-1)}}{n} \\\\\n      &= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{M-i}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen calculating successive values, a new value comes into the sum, and the oldest value drops out, meaning that a full summation each time is unnecessary for this simple case:\n\n: <math>\\overline{p}_\\text{SM} = \\overline{p}_{\\text{SM},\\text{prev}} + \\frac{1}{n} (p_M - p_{M-n}).</math>\n\nThe period selected depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long-term. In financial terms, moving-average levels can be interpreted as [[support (technical analysis)|support]] in a falling market or [[resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]] in a rising  market.\n\nIf the data used are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum point by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old datum points dropping out or new data coming in. One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.<ref>''Statistical Analysis'', Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1975, {{ISBN|0-03-089422-0}}, section 17.9.</ref>\n\nFor a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only \"past\" data. Hence a '''central moving average''' can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated.<ref>The derivation and properties of the simple central moving average are given in full at [[Savitzky\u2013Golay filter]].</ref> This requires using an odd number of datum points in the sample window.\n\nA major drawback of the SMA is that it lets through a significant amount of the signal shorter than the window length. Worse, it ''actually inverts it''. This can lead to unexpected artifacts, such as peaks in the smoothed result appearing where there were troughs in the data. It also leads to the result being less smooth than expected, since some of the higher frequencies are not properly removed.\n\n==Cumulative moving average==\nIn a '''cumulative moving average''' ('''CMA'''), the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average of all of the data up until the current datum point. For example, an investor may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted [[average]] of the sequence of ''n'' values <math>x_1. \\ldots, x_n</math> up to the current time:\n\n:<math>\\textit{CMA}_n = {{x_1 + \\cdots + x_n} \\over n}\\,.</math>\n\nThe brute-force method to calculate this would be to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide by the number of datum points every time a new datum point arrived. However, it is possible to simply update cumulative average as a new value, <math>x_{n+1}</math> becomes available, using the formula\n\n:<math>\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} = {{x_{n+1} + n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n} \\over {n+1}}.</math>\n\nThus the current cumulative average for a new datum point is equal to the previous cumulative average, times ''n'', plus the latest datum point, all divided by the number of points received so far, ''n''+1. When all of the datum points arrive ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''N''}}), then the cumulative average will equal the final average. It is also possible to store a running total of the datum point as well as the number of points and dividing the total by the number of datum points to get the CMA each time a new datum point arrives.\n\nThe derivation of the cumulative average formula is straightforward. Using\n\n:<math>x_1 + \\cdots + x_n = n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n</math>\n\nand similarly for {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, it is seen that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_{n+1} & = (x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n+1}) - (x_1 + \\cdots + x_n) \\\\[6pt]\n\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSolving this equation for <math>\\textit{CMA}_{n+1}</math> results in\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} & = {x_{n+1} + n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {x_{n+1} + (n + 1 - 1) \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {(n + 1) \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n + x_{n+1} - \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {\\textit{CMA}_n} + {{x_{n+1} - \\textit{CMA}_n} \\over {n+1}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==Weighted moving average==\nA weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different positions in the sample window. Mathematically, the weighted moving average is the [[convolution]] of the datum points with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing [[pixelisation]] from a digital graphical image.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn [[technical analysis]] of financial data, a '''weighted moving average''' (WMA) has the specific meaning of weights that decrease in arithmetical progression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weighted Moving Averages: The Basics |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/060401.asp |publisher=Investopedia}}</ref> In an ''n''-day WMA the latest day has weight ''n'', the second latest ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, etc., down to one.\n\n:<math>\\text{WMA}_{M} = { n p_{M} + (n-1) p_{M-1} + \\cdots + 2 p_{(M-n+2)} + p_{(M-n+1)} \\over n + (n-1) + \\cdots + 2 + 1}</math>\n\n[[Image:Weighted moving average weights N=15.png|thumb|right|WMA weights ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;15]]\n\nThe denominator is a [[triangle number]] equal to <math>\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}.</math> In the more general case the denominator will always be the sum of the individual weights.\n\nWhen calculating the WMA across successive values, the difference between the numerators of WMA<sub>''M''+1</sub> and WMA<sub>M</sub> is ''np''<sub>''M''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''<sub>M</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''<sub>''M''\u2212n+1</sub>.

It can be compared to the weights in the exponential moving average which follows.\n\n=={{anchor|exponential_moving_average}}Exponential moving average==\n{{further|EWMA chart|Exponential smoothing}}\n[[Image:Exponential moving average weights N=15.png|thumb|right|EMA weights&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;15]]\n\nAn '''exponential moving average (EMA)''', also known as an '''exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/filter/filewma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329135531/http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/filter/filewma.htm |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}</ref> is a first-order [[infinite impulse response]] filter that applies weighting factors which decrease [[Exponential decay|exponentially]]. The weighting for each older [[data|datum]] decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows an example of the weight decrease.\n\nThe EMA for a series ''Y'' may be calculated recursively:\n\n:<math> S_t = \\begin{cases}\n Y_1,                                           & t = 1 \\\\\n \\alpha \\cdot Y_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot S_{t-1}, & t > 1\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWhere:\n* The coefficient ''\u03b1'' represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher ''\u03b1'' discounts older observations faster.\n* ''Y<sub>t</sub>'' is the value at a time period ''t''.\n* ''S<sub>t</sub>'' is the value of the EMA at any time period ''t''.\n\n''S''<sub>1</sub> may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting ''S''<sub>1</sub> to ''Y''<sub>1</sub> as shown above, though other techniques exist, such as setting ''S''<sub>1</sub> to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The importance of the ''S''<sub>1</sub> initialisations effect on the resultant moving average depends on ''\u03b1''; smaller ''\u03b1'' values make the choice of ''S''<sub>1</sub> relatively more important than larger ''\u03b1'' values, since a higher ''\u03b1'' discounts older observations faster.\n\nWhatever is done for ''S''<sub>1</sub> it assumes something about values prior to the available data and is necessarily in error. In view of this, the early results should be regarded as unreliable until the iterations have had time to [[Convergent series|converge]]. This is sometimes called a 'spin-up' interval. One way to assess when it can be regarded as reliable is to consider the required accuracy of the result. For example, if 3% accuracy is required, initialising with ''Y''<sub>1</sub> and taking data after five time constants (defined above) will ensure that the calculation has converged to within 3% (only <3% of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> will remain in the result ). Sometimes with very small alpha, this can mean little of the result is useful. This is analogous to the problem of using a convolution filter (such as a weighted average) with a very long window.\n\nThis formulation is according to Hunter (1986).<ref>[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc431.htm NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods: Single Exponential Smoothing] at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]</ref> By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can eventually write ''S<sub>t</sub>'' as a weighted sum of the datum points ''Y<sub>t</sub>'', as:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nS_{t}=\\alpha &\\left[Y_{t}+(1-\\alpha )Y_{t-1}+(1-\\alpha )^{2}Y_{t-2}+\\cdots \\right.\\\\[6pt]&\\left.\\cdots +(1-\\alpha )^{k}Y_{t-k}\\right]+(1-\\alpha )^{k+1}S_{t-(k+1)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nfor any suitable ''k'' &isin; {0, 1, 2, ...} The weight of the general datum point <math>Y_{t-i}</math> is <math>\\alpha\\left(1 - \\alpha\\right)^{i} </math>.\n\nThis formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the latest datum point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time):\n:<math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = \\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday} + \\alpha \\left[\\text{price}_\\text{today} - \\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday}\\right]</math>\n\nExpanding out <math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday}</math> each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on each datum point ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, etc., decreases exponentially:\n:<math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = { \\alpha \\left[p_1 + (1 - \\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\cdots \\right] }</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math>p_1</math> is <math>\\text{price}_\\text{today}</math>\n* <math>p_2</math> is <math>\\text{price}_\\text{yesterday}</math>\n* and so on\n\n: <math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = \\frac{p_1 + (1 - \\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\cdots}{1 + (1 - \\alpha) + (1 - \\alpha)^2 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 + \\cdots}, </math>\n\nsince <math>1/\\alpha = 1 + (1 - \\alpha) + (1 - \\alpha)^2 + \\cdots</math>.\n\nIt can also be calculated recursively without introducing the error when initializing the first estimate (n starts from 1):\n: <math>\\text{EMA}_n = \\frac{\\text{WeightedSum}_n}{\\text{WeightedCount}_n}</math>\n: <math>\\text{WeightedSum}_n = p_n + (1 - \\alpha)\\text{WeightedSum}_{n-1}</math>\n: <math>\\text{WeightedCount}_n = 1 + (1 - \\alpha)\\text{WeightedCount}_{n-1} = \\frac{1 - (1 -\n \\alpha)^n}{1 - (1 - \\alpha)}</math>\n: Assume <math>\\text{WeightedSum}_0 = \\text{WeightedCount}_0 = 0</math>\n\nThis is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] with decreasing terms.\n\n=== Approximating the EMA with a limited number of terms ===\n\nThe question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data.  Large price values in old data will affect the total even if their weighting is very small.

Despite the name suggesting there are ''N'' periods, the terminology only specifies the ''\u03b1'' factor. ''N'' is not a stopping point for the calculation in the way it is in an [[#Simple moving average|SMA]] or [[#Weighted moving average|WMA]].

(For example, a similar proof could be used to just as easily determine that the EMA with the same ''half-life'' as an ''N''-day SMA is <math>\\alpha = 1 - 0.5^{1/(0.5N)}</math>). In fact, 2/(N+1) is merely a common convention to form an intuitive understanding of the relationship between EMAs and SMAs, for industries where both are commonly used together on the same datasets.

An example of a coefficient giving bigger weight to the current reading, and smaller weight to the older readings is\n\n:<math>\\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) = 1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{t_n - t_{n-1}}{W \\cdot 60}} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|exp()}} is the [[exponential function]], time for readings ''t''<sub>''n''</sub> is expressed in seconds, and {{mvar|W}} is the period of time in minutes over which the reading is said to be averaged (the mean lifetime of each reading in the average). Given the above definition of {{mvar|&alpha;}}, the moving average can be expressed as\n\n:<math>S_n = \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-{ {t_n - t_{n-1}} \\over {W \\cdot 60}}\\right)\\right] Y_n +\n\\exp\\left(-{{t_n - t_{n-1}} \\over {W \\cdot 60}}\\right) S_{n-1}</math>\n\nFor example, a 15-minute average ''L'' of a process queue length ''Q'', measured every 5 seconds (time difference is 5 seconds), is computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_n &= \\left[1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{5}{15 \\cdot 60}}\\right)\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\frac{5}{15 \\cdot 60}} L_{n-1} \\\\[6pt]\n      &= \\left[1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{1}{180}}\\right)\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\frac{1}{180}} L_{n-1} \\\\[6pt]\n      &= Q_n + e^{-\\frac{1}{180}} \\left( L_{n-1} - Q_n \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Other weightings==\nOther weighting systems are used occasionally \u2013 for example, in share trading a '''volume weighting''' will weight each time period in proportion to its trading volume.\n\nA further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Spencers15-PointMovingAverage.html Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average \u2014 from Wolfram MathWorld<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (a central moving average). The symmetric weight coefficients are \u22123, \u22126, \u22125, 3, 21, 46, 67, 74, 67, 46, 21, 3, \u22125, \u22126, \u22123.\n\nOutside the world of finance, weighted running means have many forms and applications. Each weighting function or \"kernel\" has its own characteristics. In engineering and science the frequency and phase response of the filter is often of primary importance in understanding the desired and undesired distortions that a particular filter will apply to the data.\n\nA mean does not just \"smooth\" the data. A mean is a form of low-pass filter. The effects of the particular filter used should be understood in order to make an appropriate choice. On this point,\nthe French version of this article discusses the spectral effects of 3 kinds of means (cumulative, exponential, Gaussian).\n\n==Moving median==\nFrom a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the '''simple moving median''' over ''n'' time points:\n\n:<math>\\widetilde{p}_\\text{SM} = \\text{Median}( p_M, p_{M-1}, \\ldots, p_{M-n+1} )</math>\n\nwhere the [[median]] is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle.  For larger values of ''n'', the median can be efficiently computed by updating an [[Skip list#Indexable skiplist|indexable skiplist]].<ref>http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576930/</ref>\n\nStatistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the fluctuations about the trend are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. However, the normal distribution does not place high probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to be [[Laplace distribution|Laplace distributed]], then the moving median is statistically optimal.<ref>G.R. Arce, \"Nonlinear Signal Processing: A Statistical Approach\", Wiley:New Jersey, USA, 2005.</ref> For a given variance, the Laplace distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving median tolerates shocks better than the moving mean.\n\nWhen the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the [[median filter]] which has applications in, for example, image signal processing.\n\n==Moving average regression model==\n{{Main|Moving-average model}}In a [[Moving average model|moving average regression model]], a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated.\n\nThose two concepts are often confused due to their name, but while they share many similarities, they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Moving averages}}\n*[[Exponential smoothing]]\n*[[MACD|Moving average convergence/divergence indicator]]\n*[[Window function]]\n*[[Moving average crossover]]\n*[[Rising moving average]]\n*[[Running total]]\n*[[Local regression]] (LOESS  and LOWESS)\n*[[Kernel smoothing]]\n*[[Moving least squares]]\n*[[Zero lag exponential moving average]]\n{{More footnotes|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{statistics}}\n{{technical analysis|state=collapsed}}\n{{Quantitative forecasting methods}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moving Average}}\n[[Category:Statistical charts and diagrams]]\n[[Category:Time series]]\n[[Category:Chart overlays]]\n[[Category:Technical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the statistical process|Moving average model}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|type of statistical measure over subsets of a dataset}}\n[[File:MovingAverage.GIF|thumb|An example of two moving average curves]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MA Example.jpg|thumb|right|13-point moving average. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nIn [[statistics]], a '''moving average''' ('''rolling average''' or '''running average''') is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of [[average]]s of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a '''moving mean''' ('''MM''')<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/cmnt091412/sldmwa/booth_et_al_2006.pdf Hydrologic Variability of the Cosumnes River Floodplain] (Booth et al., San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2006)</ref> or '''rolling mean''' and is a type of [[finite impulse response]] filter. Variations include: [[#Simple moving average|simple]], and [[#Cumulative moving average|cumulative]], or [[#Weighted moving average|weighted]] forms (described below).\n\nGiven a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by \"shifting forward\"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.\n\nA moving average is commonly used with [[time series]] data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.  The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly.  For example, it is often used in [[technical analysis]] of financial data, like stock [[price]]s, [[return (finance)|returns]] or trading volumes.  It is also used in [[economics]] to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series.  Mathematically, a moving average is a type of [[convolution]] and so it can be viewed as an example of a [[low-pass filter]] used in [[signal processing]].  When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.\n\n==Simple moving average==\n[[File:Moving Average Types comparison - Simple and Exponential.png|thumb]]\nIn financial applications a '''simple moving average''' ('''SMA''') is the unweighted [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the previous ''n'' data. However, in science and engineering, the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data on either side of a central value. This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the data rather than being shifted in time.\n{{Anchor|algorithm}}\nAn example of a simple equally weighted running mean for a ''n''-day sample of closing price is the mean of the previous ''n'' days' closing prices. If those prices are <math>p_M, p_{M-1}, \\dots, p_{M-(n-1)}</math> then the formula is\n<!--\nthis used to be a hairy sigma style with i's and j's, but prefer dots since it's a lot easier for financial people with limited math -->\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\overline{p}_\\text{SM} &= \\frac{p_M + p_{M-1} + \\cdots + p_{M-(n-1)}}{n} \\\\\n      &= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{M-i}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen calculating successive values, a new value comes into the sum, and the oldest value drops out, meaning that a full summation each time is unnecessary for this simple case:\n\n: <math>\\overline{p}_\\text{SM} = \\overline{p}_{\\text{SM},\\text{prev}} + \\frac{1}{n} (p_M - p_{M-n}).</math>\n\nThe period selected depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long-term. In financial terms, moving-average levels can be interpreted as [[support (technical analysis)|support]] in a falling market or [[resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]] in a rising  market.\n\nIf the data used are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum point by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old datum points dropping out or new data coming in. One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.<ref>''Statistical Analysis'', Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1975, {{ISBN|0-03-089422-0}}, section 17.9.</ref>\n\nFor a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only \"past\" data. Hence a '''central moving average''' can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated.<ref>The derivation and properties of the simple central moving average are given in full at [[Savitzky\u2013Golay filter]].</ref> This requires using an odd number of datum points in the sample window.\n\nA major drawback of the SMA is that it lets through a significant amount of the signal shorter than the window length. Worse, it ''actually inverts it''. This can lead to unexpected artifacts, such as peaks in the smoothed result appearing where there were troughs in the data. It also leads to the result being less smooth than expected, since some of the higher frequencies are not properly removed.\n\n==Cumulative moving average==\nIn a '''cumulative moving average''' ('''CMA'''), the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average of all of the data up until the current datum point. For example, an investor may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted [[average]] of the sequence of ''n'' values <math>x_1. \\ldots, x_n</math> up to the current time:\n\n:<math>\\textit{CMA}_n = {{x_1 + \\cdots + x_n} \\over n}\\,.</math>\n\nThe brute-force method to calculate this would be to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide by the number of datum points every time a new datum point arrived. However, it is possible to simply update cumulative average as a new value, <math>x_{n+1}</math> becomes available, using the formula\n\n:<math>\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} = {{x_{n+1} + n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n} \\over {n+1}}.</math>\n\nThus the current cumulative average for a new datum point is equal to the previous cumulative average, times ''n'', plus the latest datum point, all divided by the number of points received so far, ''n''+1. When all of the datum points arrive ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''N''}}), then the cumulative average will equal the final average. It is also possible to store a running total of the datum point as well as the number of points and dividing the total by the number of datum points to get the CMA each time a new datum point arrives.\n\nThe derivation of the cumulative average formula is straightforward. Using\n\n:<math>x_1 + \\cdots + x_n = n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n</math>\n\nand similarly for {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, it is seen that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_{n+1} & = (x_1 + \\cdots + x_{n+1}) - (x_1 + \\cdots + x_n) \\\\[6pt]\n\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSolving this equation for <math>\\textit{CMA}_{n+1}</math> results in\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} & = {x_{n+1} + n \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {x_{n+1} + (n + 1 - 1) \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {(n + 1) \\cdot \\textit{CMA}_n + x_{n+1} - \\textit{CMA}_n \\over {n+1}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = {\\textit{CMA}_n} + {{x_{n+1} - \\textit{CMA}_n} \\over {n+1}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==Weighted moving average==\nA weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different positions in the sample window. Mathematically, the weighted moving average is the [[convolution]] of the datum points with a fixed weighting function.

The weighting for each older [[data|datum]] decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows an example of the weight decrease.\n\nThe EMA for a series ''Y'' may be calculated recursively:\n\n:<math> S_t = \\begin{cases}\n Y_1,                                           & t = 1 \\\\\n \\alpha \\cdot Y_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot S_{t-1}, & t > 1\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWhere:\n* The coefficient ''\u03b1'' represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher ''\u03b1'' discounts older observations faster.\n* ''Y<sub>t</sub>'' is the value at a time period ''t''.\n* ''S<sub>t</sub>'' is the value of the EMA at any time period ''t''.\n\n''S''<sub>1</sub> may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting ''S''<sub>1</sub> to ''Y''<sub>1</sub> as shown above, though other techniques exist, such as setting ''S''<sub>1</sub> to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The importance of the ''S''<sub>1</sub> initialisations effect on the resultant moving average depends on ''\u03b1''; smaller ''\u03b1'' values make the choice of ''S''<sub>1</sub> relatively more important than larger ''\u03b1'' values, since a higher ''\u03b1'' discounts older observations faster.\n\nWhatever is done for ''S''<sub>1</sub> it assumes something about values prior to the available data and is necessarily in error. In view of this, the early results should be regarded as unreliable until the iterations have had time to [[Convergent series|converge]]. This is sometimes called a 'spin-up' interval. One way to assess when it can be regarded as reliable is to consider the required accuracy of the result. For example, if 3% accuracy is required, initialising with ''Y''<sub>1</sub> and taking data after five time constants (defined above) will ensure that the calculation has converged to within 3% (only <3% of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> will remain in the result ). Sometimes with very small alpha, this can mean little of the result is useful. This is analogous to the problem of using a convolution filter (such as a weighted average) with a very long window.\n\nThis formulation is according to Hunter (1986).<ref>[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc431.htm NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods: Single Exponential Smoothing] at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]</ref> By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can eventually write ''S<sub>t</sub>'' as a weighted sum of the datum points ''Y<sub>t</sub>'', as:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nS_{t}=\\alpha &\\left[Y_{t}+(1-\\alpha )Y_{t-1}+(1-\\alpha )^{2}Y_{t-2}+\\cdots \\right.\\\\[6pt]&\\left.\\cdots +(1-\\alpha )^{k}Y_{t-k}\\right]+(1-\\alpha )^{k+1}S_{t-(k+1)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nfor any suitable ''k'' &isin; {0, 1, 2, ...} The weight of the general datum point <math>Y_{t-i}</math> is <math>\\alpha\\left(1 - \\alpha\\right)^{i} </math>.\n\nThis formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the latest datum point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time):\n:<math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = \\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday} + \\alpha \\left[\\text{price}_\\text{today} - \\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday}\\right]</math>\n\nExpanding out <math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{yesterday}</math> each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on each datum point ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, etc., decreases exponentially:\n:<math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = { \\alpha \\left[p_1 + (1 - \\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\cdots \\right] }</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math>p_1</math> is <math>\\text{price}_\\text{today}</math>\n* <math>p_2</math> is <math>\\text{price}_\\text{yesterday}</math>\n* and so on\n\n: <math>\\text{EMA}_\\text{today} = \\frac{p_1 + (1 - \\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\cdots}{1 + (1 - \\alpha) + (1 - \\alpha)^2 + (1 - \\alpha)^3 + \\cdots}, </math>\n\nsince <math>1/\\alpha = 1 + (1 - \\alpha) + (1 - \\alpha)^2 + \\cdots</math>.\n\nIt can also be calculated recursively without introducing the error when initializing the first estimate (n starts from 1):\n: <math>\\text{EMA}_n = \\frac{\\text{WeightedSum}_n}{\\text{WeightedCount}_n}</math>\n: <math>\\text{WeightedSum}_n = p_n + (1 - \\alpha)\\text{WeightedSum}_{n-1}</math>\n: <math>\\text{WeightedCount}_n = 1 + (1 - \\alpha)\\text{WeightedCount}_{n-1} = \\frac{1 - (1 -\n \\alpha)^n}{1 - (1 - \\alpha)}</math>\n: Assume <math>\\text{WeightedSum}_0 = \\text{WeightedCount}_0 = 0</math>\n\nThis is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] with decreasing terms.\n\n=== Approximating the EMA with a limited number of terms ===\n\nThe question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data.

An example of a coefficient giving bigger weight to the current reading, and smaller weight to the older readings is\n\n:<math>\\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) = 1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{t_n - t_{n-1}}{W \\cdot 60}} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|exp()}} is the [[exponential function]], time for readings ''t''<sub>''n''</sub> is expressed in seconds, and {{mvar|W}} is the period of time in minutes over which the reading is said to be averaged (the mean lifetime of each reading in the average). Given the above definition of {{mvar|&alpha;}}, the moving average can be expressed as\n\n:<math>S_n = \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-{ {t_n - t_{n-1}} \\over {W \\cdot 60}}\\right)\\right] Y_n +\n\\exp\\left(-{{t_n - t_{n-1}} \\over {W \\cdot 60}}\\right) S_{n-1}</math>\n\nFor example, a 15-minute average ''L'' of a process queue length ''Q'', measured every 5 seconds (time difference is 5 seconds), is computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_n &= \\left[1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{5}{15 \\cdot 60}}\\right)\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\frac{5}{15 \\cdot 60}} L_{n-1} \\\\[6pt]\n      &= \\left[1 - \\exp\\left({-\\frac{1}{180}}\\right)\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\frac{1}{180}} L_{n-1} \\\\[6pt]\n      &= Q_n + e^{-\\frac{1}{180}} \\left( L_{n-1} - Q_n \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Other weightings==\nOther weighting systems are used occasionally \u2013 for example, in share trading a '''volume weighting''' will weight each time period in proportion to its trading volume.\n\nA further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Spencers15-PointMovingAverage.html Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average \u2014 from Wolfram MathWorld<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (a central moving average).

Each weighting function or \"kernel\" has its own characteristics. In engineering and science the frequency and phase response of the filter is often of primary importance in understanding the desired and undesired distortions that a particular filter will apply to the data.\n\nA mean does not just \"smooth\" the data. A mean is a form of low-pass filter. The effects of the particular filter used should be understood in order to make an appropriate choice. On this point,\nthe French version of this article discusses the spectral effects of 3 kinds of means (cumulative, exponential, Gaussian).\n\n==Moving median==\nFrom a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the '''simple moving median''' over ''n'' time points:\n\n:<math>\\widetilde{p}_\\text{SM} = \\text{Median}( p_M, p_{M-1}, \\ldots, p_{M-n+1} )</math>\n\nwhere the [[median]] is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle.  For larger values of ''n'', the median can be efficiently computed by updating an [[Skip list#Indexable skiplist|indexable skiplist]].<ref>http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576930/</ref>\n\nStatistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the fluctuations about the trend are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. However, the normal distribution does not place high probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to be [[Laplace distribution|Laplace distributed]], then the moving median is statistically optimal.<ref>G.R. Arce, \"Nonlinear Signal Processing: A Statistical Approach\", Wiley:New Jersey, USA, 2005.</ref> For a given variance, the Laplace distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving median tolerates shocks better than the moving mean.\n\nWhen the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the [[median filter]] which has applications in, for example, image signal processing.\n\n==Moving average regression model==\n{{Main|Moving-average model}}In a [[Moving average model|moving average regression model]], a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated.\n\nThose two concepts are often confused due to their name, but while they share many similarities, they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Moving_averages}}\n*[[Exponential smoothing]]\n*[[MACD|Moving average convergence/divergence indicator]]\n*[[Window function]]\n*[[Moving average crossover]]\n*[[Rising moving average]]\n*[[Running total]]\n*[[Local regression]] (LOESS  and LOWESS)\n*[[Kernel smoothing]]\n*[[Moving least squares]]\n*[[Zero lag exponential moving average]]\n{{More footnotes|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{statistics}}\n{{technical analysis|state=collapsed}}\n{{Quantitative forecasting methods}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moving Average}}\n[[Category:Statistical charts and diagrams]]\n[[Category:Time series]]\n[[Category:Chart overlays]]\n[[Category:Technical analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Kai Burghardt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:Fixing style/layout errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average"}

For those with higher incomes, more of the food consumed is purchased at market. Most vegetables are in villages and town markets, which usually have a major day, or multiple days, where traders and retailers are active in selling perishables in particular. Fish, meats, staple starch crops, legumes, soy and milk cheeses, fruits, and vegetables are available in the market every week of the year in most places with significant variations in the quantity supplied. Staple crops are usually sold to retailers by wholesalers, who obtain them from the producers. Meat is sold by the [[butcher]]s who source from the producers. The source of vegetables depends on the season. Regional trade keeps a selection of vegetables available, with price and quantity fluctuations depending on the season. Visits to markets in the [[Parakou]] and [[Nikki, Benin|Nikki]] areas observed [[avocado]]s from [[Lom\u00e9]] in Togo and [[red onion]]s from Niger. Eastern border markets have many Nigerian traders coming into Benin to purchase fruits and vegetables for sale in Nigeria. Most of these transactions are not captured in either of the countries' statistical records. Vegetables traders/retailers obtain their products either from the intermediary traders or directly at the [[Farm gate marketing|farm gate]] if possible. For many items there are unwritten agreements that producers will sell to retailers, not directly to consumers. Intermediaries buy at the farms and transport the products directly to their various market destinations. Women dominate the role of vegetable retailers at these open markets. Vegetable producers market much of their produce in bulk at harvest time because of the highly perishable nature of their products. In general, producers conduct all of their sales immediately after harvest. The long marketing channel of vegetables in the larger peri-urban and urban areas involves several types of intermediaries, from local traders to wholesalers. Studies by INRAB have shown that producers are more inefficient in marketing than in production.

A bridge spans the Niger River linking Benin to Niger Republic. Massive movement of grains and other commodities in trucks was observed and the offloading of commodities from Benin and neighboring countries was regular. Corn, beans, rice, peanuts, cashews, pineapples, cassava, yams, and other various tubers from Benin are sold to mostly traders from Niger Republic. Traders from the Niger Republic bring different types of beans, including soybeans, to sell in Benin. Corn sold for about US$45 per 100&nbsp;kg bag (July 2013) at that market while price for the same quantity is approximately US$39 in Nigeria. Like Nigerian farmers, corn farmers in Benin feared becoming uncompetitive if Nigeria permits free imports of corn.<ref name=\"fas\" />\n* [[N\u2019Dali|N'Dali]] and surrounding area markets: The main marketday here is on Saturday.

For items like onions or soap, the item price is kept constant while adjustments are made on the quantity sold for that fixed price. Dissimilarly, prices for a measure of grains are adjusted based on wholesale purchase prices. Interestingly, cow milk and soy cheese (tofu) are also available. The cattle killed and sold in this market are either local or brought down from Malanville, and it was thought that some of these cattle pass through N'Dali on their way to Nigeria. West of N'Dali up to [[Sokodumnou]] village (about 40\u201350 miles from N'Dali center) are dry vast lands featuring piles of harvested cotton and [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic cattle rearing]].

This was an increase of 30 cattle over the 102 sold the year before according to their record book. The number of cattle sold can reach 180 at the peak of the rainy season, in July, while it dwindles in the dry season, as the cattlemen and their herds move away in search of green pasture and water. Depending on the size and health status of the cattle, prices range between 60,000 CFA for a small cow and up to 800,000 CFA for a big bull. Similarly, sheep and goats prices range between 15,000 CFA and 60,000 CFA per animal, but can be sold at 100,000 CFA for the Muslim holiday called [[Eid al-Adha|Tabaski]].

In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.<ref>ARRP Bulletin.

Betsy Tower. page 50. citing Commuting in America III and Arbitron.</ref>\n\nThe term ''country music'' is used today to describe many [[List of country genres|styles]] and subgenres. The origins of country music are found in the [[folk music]] of [[working class Americans]] and/or [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[United States|American]] life, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants and Southern African.\n\n==Generations==\nThe first generation emerged in the early 1920s, with [[Country music in Atlanta|Atlanta's music scene]] playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. [[Gid Tanner|James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner]] (1885\u20131960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the [[Skillet Lickers]], was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label [[Okeh Records]] began issuing hillbilly music records by [[Fiddlin' John Carson]] as early as 1923, followed by [[Columbia Records]] (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") ([[Samantha Bumgarner]]) in 1924, and [[RCA Victor Records]] in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the first family of country music [[Carter Family|The Carter Family]].<ref name=\"78discography.com\">[http://www.78discography.com/COL15000D.htm 78discography.com] ''The Online Discography Project''.</ref> Many \"hillbilly\" musicians, such as [[Cliff Carlisle]], recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.<ref name=\"Russell 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225\">{{cite book| last = Russell| first = Tony| title = Country Music Originals: The Legends and the Lost| date = 2007-11-15| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-532509-6| pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225]| url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the second generation (1930s\u20131940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring the king of the \"singing cowboys\", [[Gene Autry]]. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.<ref name=\"Takecountryback.com\">[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com], Merle Haggard \u2013 Bob Wills {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085028/http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".\n\nThe third generation (1950s\u20131960s) started at the end of [[World War II]] with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], which emerged when [[Bill Monroe]], along with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] were introduced by [[Roy Acuff]] at the Grand Ole Opry. [[Gospel music]] remained a popular component of country music. Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods, became popular among poor communities in [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]; the basic ensemble consisted of [[classical guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[dobro]] or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured [[electric guitar]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of [[tack piano]]), [[banjo]]s, and [[drum]]s. This sound had its roots in the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Hispanos|Hispano]], and [[American frontier]] music of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], including [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[Honky tonk music|honky tonk]], [[ranchera]], and [[corrido]]. By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music, with [[Johnny Cash]] emerging as one of the most popular and enduring representatives of the rockabilly genre; rockabilly was also a starting point for eventual rock-and-roll superstar [[Elvis Presley]], who would return to his country roots near the end of his life. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the [[Nashville sound]] turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]] were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the early 1950s, and during the mid-1960s, Western singer-songwriters such as [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and [[Marty Robbins]] rose in prominence as did others, throughout Western music traditions, like [[New Mexico music]]'s [[Al Hurricane]]. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].\n\nFourth generation (1970s\u20131980s) music included [[outlaw country]] with roots in the [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country pop]] with roots in the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]], folk music and [[soft rock]]. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist [[John Denver]] released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] gained popularity with performers like [[Freddie Fender]]. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production; this [[neotraditional country|neotraditional movement]] would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of [[George Strait]]. Attempts to combine [[Punk rock|punk]] and country were pioneered by [[Jason and the Scorchers]], and in the 1980s Southern Californian [[cowpunk]] scene with bands like [[the Long Ryders]] and [[Mojo Nixon]].\n\nDuring the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as [[Alan Jackson]], and the more broadly popular [[stadium rock|stadium country]] acts, in particular [[Garth Brooks]]. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe sixth generation (2000s\u2013present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. The influence of [[rock music]] in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were in the country pop genre, such as those by [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Taylor Swift]].<ref name=\"best-selling\" /> [[Hip-hop]] also made its mark on country music with the emergence of [[country rap]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/6150280/despite-hits-no-radio-love-yet-for-country-rap |title=Despite Hits, No Radio Love Yet For Country Rap |agency= Associated Press |magazine=Billboard |date= July 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===First generation (1920s)===\n[[File:Vernon Dalhart 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vernon Dalhart]] was the first country star to have a major hit record]]\n\nThe first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"[[The Arkansas Traveler (song)|Arkansas Traveler]]\" and \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & [[Eck Robertson|A.C.

Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. [[Patsy Montana]] opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. [[Cliff Bruner]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Milton Brown]] and [[Adolph Hofner]] were other early Western swing pioneers. [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Tex Williams]] also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, Western swing rivaled the popularity of [[big band]] swing music.\n\n====Changing instrumentation====\nDrums were scorned by early country musicians as being \"too loud\" and \"not pure\", but by 1935 Western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the [[Texas Playboys]]. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956.

By the early 1950s, a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, [[New Mexico music|New Mexico]], [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] rhythms of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", first recorded by [[Marty Robbins]] in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, Western musicians like [[Michael Martin Murphey]], [[New Mexico music]] artists [[Al Hurricane]] and [[Antonia Apodaca]], [[Tejano music]] performer [[Little Joe (singer)|Little Joe]], and even folk revivalist [[John Denver]], all first rose to prominence during this time. This Western music influence largely kept the music of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] and [[folk rock]] from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, [[The Byrds]]' negative reception during their appearance on the ''Grand Ole Opry''). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. Only a handful of folk artists, such as [[Burl Ives]] and Canadian musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]], would cross over into country music after the folk revival died out. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.<ref>{{cite book| last = Morrison| first = Craig| title = Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers| date = 1996-09-01| publisher = University of Illinois Press| isbn = 978-0-252-02207-4| page = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in [[Lubbock, Texas]].<ref name=hamilton>{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| last = Hamilton| first=Shane |title = Trucking Country: The Road to America's Wal-Mart Economy| journal = Trucking Country| pages = 187\u2013232| chapter = Agrarian Trucking Culture and Deregulatory Capitalism, 1960\u201380| date = 2008| jstor = j.ctt7t2vg.12| isbn = 9780691135823}}</ref> The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and [[History of the trucking industry in the United States|truckers]] in particular.

These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music.

The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the [[Ozarks]].

Under the direction of producers such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], [[Owen Bradley]], [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]], and later [[Billy Sherrill]], the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a [[string section]] (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included [[Jim Reeves]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Connie Smith]], [[The Browns]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 10\u201311}} [[Patsy Cline]], and [[Eddy Arnold]]. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician [[Floyd Cramer]] was an important component of this style.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/floyd-cramer |title=Rockhall.com |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the [[British Invasion]] and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into [[countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Lynn Anderson]] and [[Charlie Rich]], as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[Marty Robbins]]. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Buck Owens]], [[Porter Wagoner]], George Jones, and [[Sonny James]] among them.\n\n====Country-soul crossover====\n{{Main|Country soul}}\nIn 1962, [[Ray Charles]] surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western music, topping the charts and rating number three for the year on ''Billboard's'' pop chart<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1962 |title=Billboard.com |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109172855/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The%2BBillboard%2BHot%2B100&g=Year-end%2BSingles&year=1962 |archivedate=9 January 2010 }}</ref> with the \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" single, and recording the landmark album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]''.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 16}}\n\n====Bakersfield sound====\nAnother subgenre of country music grew out of hardcore honky tonk with elements of [[Western swing]] and originated {{convert|112|mi|km|0}} north-northwest of Los Angeles in [[Bakersfield, California]], where many \"[[Okie]]s\" and other [[Dust Bowl]] migrants had settled.

Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Anne Murray]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[The Bellamy Brothers]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\", \"[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]\", \"[[Annie's Song]]\", \"[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]\", and \"[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, [[Jean Shepard]] and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.\n[[File:Dolly Parton, 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dolly Parton]]]]\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again]]\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]], came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|The First Edition]], achieving success the same year with \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]\", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]] would also find success on the pop charts with their records. In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', \"Country music isn't really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hemphill | first1 = Paul | year = 1975 | title = Nashville\u2014Where It All Started | url = | journal = Saturday Evening Post | volume = 247 | issue = 3| pages = 44\u201386 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Juice Newton]] each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted \"[[Always on My Mind]]\" (No. 5, 1982) and \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\" (No. 5, 1984, a duet with [[Julio Iglesias]]), and Newton achieved success with \"[[Queen of Hearts (Hank DeVito song)|Queen of Hearts]]\" (No. 2, 1981) and \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\" (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the 1980s: \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\" by [[Kenny Rogers]], from the late fall of 1980; \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" by [[Dolly Parton]], \"[[I Love a Rainy Night]]\" by [[Eddie Rabbitt]] (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]].

The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]]. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Dylan]], who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 54}} (and even more so with that album's follow-up, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''), followed by [[Gene Clark]], Clark's former band [[The Byrds]] (with [[Gram Parsons]] on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'') and its spin-off [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[The Monkees]] and the [[First National Band]]), the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], among many, even the former folk music duo [[Ian & Sylvia]], who formed [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] in 1969.

Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and [[The Judds]].\n\nBeginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. The arrival of exceptionally talented artists coincided with new marketing strategies to engage fans, technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. [[Garth Brooks]] (\"Friends in Low Places\") in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and [[arena rock|stadium rock]]. Other artists such as [[Brooks and Dunn]] (\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\") also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] updated neotraditionalist styles.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jocelyn R.|title=Country Music|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2224075|website=Oxford music online}}</ref>\n\n===Fifth generation (1990s)===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Garth Brooks at We Are One (edit).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Garth Brooks]]]]\n{{See also|1990s_in_music#Country_music|l1=1990s in music \u00a7 Country}}\n\nCountry music was aided by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Docket 80\u201390, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]] (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the [[classic country]] format for the AM audience). At the same time, [[beautiful music]] stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which had published a [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on [[country radio]] determined a song's place on the chart.<ref>{{cite journal|title=R&B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|journal=Billboard|date=24 April 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=Nielsen+Broadcast+Data+Systems+january+20+1990#v=onepage&q=Nielsen%20Broadcast%20Data%20Systems%20january%2020%201990&f=false|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=1992-08-19 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=1992-09-27 |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=1993-11-25 |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2010-07-26 | first=Jack | last=Hurst}}</ref> who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

[[Toby Keith]] began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the late 1990s with ''[[Pull My Chain]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]''.\n\n====Success of female artists====\nFemale artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Mindy McCready]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album ''[[Wide Open Spaces]]'' went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]]'s comments disparaging then-President [[George W. Bush]] while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the [[Iraq War]] a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall among non-country audiences but largely ignored among country audiences. After ''Taking the Long Way'', the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the [[Court Yard Hounds]]) before reuniting in 2016 and releasing new material in 2020.\n\n[[File:ShaniaTwain3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shania Twain]] performing during her [[Up! Tour]] in 2004]]\n\n[[Shania Twain]] became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, ''[[The Woman in Me (Shania Twain album)|The Woman in Me]]'', which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's ''[[Come On Over]]'', which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time.\n\nUnlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical '[[honky-tonk]]' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.\n\n====Line dancing revival====\nIn the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying, \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"<ref>The Roots of Country Music\" Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994</ref> By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as [[Don Williams]] and [[George Jones]] who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.\n\n====Alt-country/Americana====\n{{Main|Alt country|cowpunk}}\n\n[[File:WilcoFIB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Wilco]] performing in Spain in 2007]]\n\nCountry influences combined with [[Punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] to forge the \"[[cowpunk]]\" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as [[The Long Ryders]], [[Lone Justice]] and [[The Beat Farmers]], as well as the established punk group [[X (American band)|X]], whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.<ref name=\"Malone2002\">W.

Earle, in particular, was noted for his popularity with both country and [[college rock]] audiences: He promoted his 1986 debut album ''[[Guitar Town]]'' with a tour that saw him open for both country singer [[Dwight Yoakam]] and alternative rock band [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=Guitar Town \u2013 Steve Earle {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/guitar-town-mw0000189768|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Yoakam also cultivated a fanbase spanning multiple genres through his stripped-down [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] influenced sound, association with the cowpunk scene, and performances at Los Angeles punk rock clubs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Dwight Yoakam {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=7 August 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThese early styles had coalesced into a genre by the time the Illinois group [[Uncle Tupelo]] released their influential debut album ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'' in 1990.<ref name=smith2009>C.

[[Kid Rock]]'s collaboration with [[Sheryl Crow]], \"[[Picture (song)|Picture]],\" was a major crossover hit in 2001 and began Kid Rock's transition from hard rock to a country-rock hybrid that would later produce another major crossover hit, 2008's \"[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]].\" (Crow would also cross over into country with her hit \"[[Easy (Sheryl Crow song)|Easy]].\") [[Darius Rucker]], frontman for the 1990s pop-rock band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], began a country solo career in the late 2000s, one that to date has produced three albums and several hits on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Singer-songwriter [[Unknown Hinson]] became famous for his appearance in the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] television show ''Wild, Wild, South'', after which Hinson started his own band and toured in southern states.

Underwood's debut album, ''[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]'', became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the #1 Country Album of the 2000\u20132009 decade.

In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has listed Underwood as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].\nIn 2016, Underwood topped the [[Country Airplay]] chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.\n\n[[Carrie Underwood]] was one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s.

The series ''[[Nashville Star]]'', while not nearly as successful as ''Idol'', did manage to bring [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]] to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as [[Buddy Jewell]], [[Sean Patrick McGraw]], and Canadian musician [[George Canyon]]. ''[[Can You Duet]]?'' produced the duos [[Steel Magnolia]] and [[Joey + Rory]]. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress [[Jennette McCurdy]] (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom ''[[iCarly]]'') released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"[[Generation Love]]\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, [[Miley Cyrus]] (of ''[[Hannah Montana]]''), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]\" and another with a duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], with \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]].\" [[Jana Kramer]], an actress in the teen drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013.

Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]],\" was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Swift released her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]], which spent 275 weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', which made her the second longest number-one charted on ''Billboard'' 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'') within the past 5 years. At the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010 Grammys]], Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for ''Fearless'', which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] already. Buoyed by her [[teen idol]] status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and [[Hot Country Songs]] chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) were released solely to [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6228999/taylor-swift-country-music-split |title=Are Taylor Swift and Country Splitting Up for Good? |author= Jem Aswad |date= August 22, 2014 |work=Billboard }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/taylor-swift-country-pop-transformation-20140909 |title=Trace Taylor Swift's Country-to-Pop Transformation in 5 Song |author= Keith Harris |date=September 9, 2014 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/08/18/taylor-swift-shakes-off-country-with-first-pop-album-1989/14256849/ |title=Taylor Swift shakes off country with first pop album |author=Patrick Ryan and Brian Mansfield |work= USA TODAY |date= August 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, \"[[Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)]]\", wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\" pays tribute to New York City, and its popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing in front of the Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city.

Artists like [[Tyler Childers]] have been increasing the popularity of this genre. Some may claim that his music is from the heart and you can feel what he is singing. The genre has developed in the [[Northern Kentucky]] and [[Cincinnati]] area. It is called bluegrass because of the type of grass that is in this area. Other artists include [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Osborne Brothers]], and many others.\n\n==== Country pop ====\n{{Main|Country pop}}\nIn the mid to late 2010s, country music began to increasingly sound more like the style of modern day [[Pop music|Pop]] music. Some modern artists that primarily or entirely produce [[country pop]] music include [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Sam Hunt]], [[Kane Brown]], [[Chris Lane]], and [[Dan + Shay]]. With more simple and repetitive lyrics, more electronic-based instrumentation and experimentation with \"talk-singing\" and rap, Pop-Country pulled farther away from the traditional sounds of country music. \n\nHowever, some newer artists have thrived despite using a more traditional country sound, such as [[Jon Pardi]] and [[Riley Green (singer)|Riley Green]]. [[Chris Stapleton]] earned acclaim during this period for his traditional-leaning country sound that fused elements of soul and rock.\n\n==International==\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Canadian country music|Canadian Country Music Association|Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame}}\n[[File:ShaniaTwainJunoAwardsMar2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Shania Twain in 2011]]\nOutside of the United States, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base, something that is to be expected given the two countries' proximity and cultural parallels. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]], the [[British Columbia Interior]], Ontario, and in [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Charles K. |author2=James Edward Akenson |title=The Women of Country Music |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=162=163}}</ref> [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] developed in Atlantic Canada in the form of Scottish, Acadian and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish, French and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Atlantic Provinces ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]]).<ref name=\"book\"/> Like the southern United States and [[Appalachia]], all four regions are of heavy [[British Isles]] stock and rural; as such, the development of traditional music in the Maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the US South and Appalachia. Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or \"[[sea shanty]]\" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and [[Music of Ireland|Irish]] in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.\n\n''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' was a [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. ''Don Messer's Jubilee'' followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named \"Goin' to the Barndance Tonight\", followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his \"Islanders\" including singers [[Marg Osburne]] and [[Charlie Chamberlain]], the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with \"[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]\".\n\nThe guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] and [[Catherine McKinnon]]. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. [[Hank Snow]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] (also known as Montana Slim), and [[Anne Murray]] are the three most notable.\n\nThe cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.<ref name=\"book\"/> While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]], [[Canadians of German ethnicity|German]] and others. For these reasons [[polka]]s and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the [[Folk music|folk]] or [[Celtic music|Celtic]] genres.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nMany traditional country artists are present in eastern and western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include [[Shania Twain]], [[Anne Murray]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[George Canyon]], [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Tommy Hunter]], [[Rita MacNeil]], [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Ronnie Prophet]], [[Carroll Baker (singer)|Carroll Baker]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Johnny Reid]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[Jason McCoy]], [[George Fox (singer)|George Fox]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Don Messer]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]], [[Michelle Wright]], [[Terri Clark]], [[Prairie Oyster]], [[Family Brown]], [[Johnny Mooring]], [[Marg Osburne]], [[Lindsay Ell]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans]], [[Crystal Shawanda]], [[Dean Brody]], [[Shane Yellowbird]], [[Gord Bamford]], [[Chad Brownlee]], [[The Road Hammers]], [[Brett Kissel]], [[Colter Wall]] and [[The Higgins]].\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Australian country music}}\n[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|[[Olivia Newton-John]] singing in [[Sydney]] in 2008]]\n\n[[Australian country music]] has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the guitar, [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.\n\nFolk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearers]], continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"[[bush band]] music\". \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include \"[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]\", \"[[Click Go the Shears]]\", \"The Queensland Drover\" and \"The Dying Stockman\". Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |title=Bush songs and music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406104520/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |archivedate=2011-04-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217020802/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |archivedate=2011-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nPioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] (known as \"The Father of Australian Country Music\") in the 1930s. Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], [[Shirley Thoms]] and [[Smoky Dawson]]. Buddy Williams (1918\u20131986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.\n\nIn 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. [[Slim Dusty]] (1927\u20132003) was known as the \"King of Australian Country Music\" and helped to popularise the Australian [[bush ballad]]. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave\" Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]].

The [[Bee Gees]] had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (\"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\") and a major hit as songwriters (\"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\"); [[Barry Gibb]], the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/news/bee-gees-barry-gibb-country-music-always-inspired-us |title=The Bee Gees' Barry Gibb: \"Country Music Always Inspired Us\" |date=November 4, 2013 |publisher=Country Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085038/http://www.countryweekly.com/news/bee-gees-barry-gibb-country-music-always-inspired-us |archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Singer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with \"[[After the Lovin']],\" achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his faithful covers of Nashville country ballads such as \"[[Release Me (1949 song)|Release Me]],\" \"[[Am I That Easy to Forget]]\" and \"[[There Goes My Everything (song)|There Goes My Everything]].\" The songwriting tandem of [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] and [[Roger Greenaway]] wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Welsh singer [[Bonnie Tyler]] initially started her career making country albums and was even nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] before her huge crossover hit \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\" lead her towards more commercial pop and rock. In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album ''[[Rocks and Honey]]'' which featured a duet with American country icon [[Vince Gill]]. Tyler subsequently announced that she was making a new country rock album in Nashville with [[John Carter Cash]], son of country music legends [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]], slated for release in 2018.\n\n===Other international country music===\nTom Roland, from the [[Country Music Association]] International, explains country music's global popularity: \"In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners around the globe have something in common with those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits.\"<ref name=int/> One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was [[George Hamilton IV]]. He was the first country musician to perform in the [[Soviet Union]]; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the \"International Ambassador of Country Music\" for his contributions to the [[globalization]] of country music.<ref>[http://www.lib.unc.edu/spotlight/hamilton_loudermilk.html Lib.unc.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111222/http://www.lib.unc.edu/spotlight/hamilton_loudermilk.html |date=July 29, 2013 }} \"Country Music Figures Donate Papers, Give Concert\"</ref> Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours.<ref name=\"int\">[http://www.cmaworld.com/international/default.asp CMAworld.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923182808/http://www.cmaworld.com/international/default.asp |date=September 23, 2010 }}</ref> The [[Country Music Association]] undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.<ref name=int/>\n\n====Latin America====\n[[Regional Mexican]] is [[Mexico|Mexico's]] version of country music. It includes a number of different subgenres, depending on where they originated, and in what regions they are popular. One specific song style, the [[Ranchera]], found its origins in the Mexican countryside and was first popularized with [[Mariachi]]. It has since also become popular with [[Banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Duranguense]] and other regional Mexican styles. The [[Corrido]], a different song style with a similar history, is also performed in many different regional styles. Other song styles performed in regional Mexican music include [[Sentimental ballad|Ballad]]s, [[Cumbia]]s, [[Boleros]], among others. American-style country music is also popular in Mexico, but most prominently in the northern regions of the country, where a number of bands and solo artists perform the genre while singing in Spanish. It is known as Country en Espa\u00f1ol (Country in Spanish), and originated in the 1980s. It most resembles [[Neotraditional country]]. Famous bands include the likes of Wild West, Caballo Dorado (Golden Horse), and 8 Segundos (8 Seconds). [[Tejano music|Tejano]] (also known as \"Tex-Mex\" in English) is popular in Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, particularly in and near [[Texas]] (especially [[South Texas]]), and in northeastern areas of Mexico.\n \nIn [[Brazil]], there is [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|M\u00fasica Sertaneja]], a popular genre very similar to American country music, sharing its rich history of development in the countryside.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], on the last weekend of September, the yearly San Pedro Country Music Festival<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.country2.com |title=Country2.com |publisher=Country2.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> takes place in the town of [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires]]. The festival features bands from different places in [[Argentina]], as well as international artists from Brazil, [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and the United States.\n\n====Asia====\nIn [[India]], the [[Anglo-Indian]] community is well known for enjoying and performing country music. An annual concert festival called \"Blazing Guitars\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2158484.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707011005/http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2158484.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-07 |title=Country Roads |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=2011-07-19 }}</ref> held in [[Chennai]] brings together Anglo-Indian musicians from all over the country (including some who have emigrated to places like Australia).\nThe year 2003 brought home \u2013 grown Indian, [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]] to the forefront of the country music culture in India when he became India's first international country music artist to chart singles in Australia.\n\nIn [[Iran]], country music has appeared in recent years. According to [[Melodymag|''Melody Music Magazine'']], the pioneer of country music in Iran is the English-speaking country music band [[Dream Rovers]], whose founder, singer and songwriter is Erfan Rezayatbakhsh (elf).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodymag.com/2012/07/%DA%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C/|title=\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u06af\u0631\u0648\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0650 \"\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0648\u0650\u0631\u0632\" \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u0645\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc|accessdate=2012-08-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728030801/http://www.melodymag.com/2012/07/%DA%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C/|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref> The band was formed in 2007 in [[Tehran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dreamrovers.com/biography/ |title=Dream Rovers \u2013 Biography |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and during this time they have been trying to introduce and popularize country music in Iran by releasing two studio albums<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodymag.com/2011/08/%D8%A2%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B4%E2%80%8C%D8%A8%DA%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%88/|title=\u0622\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0634\u200c\u0628\u06a9 \u0627\u0632 \u06af\u0631\u0648\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0648\u0631\u0632 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u0645\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc|accessdate=2012-08-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031171934/http://www.melodymag.com/2011/08/%D8%A2%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B4%E2%80%8C%D8%A8%DA%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%88/|archivedate=2012-10-31}}</ref> and performing live at concerts, despite the difficulties that the Islamic regime in Iran makes for bands that are active in the western music field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jadidonline.com/story/25042011/frnk/iran_country_music |title=\u0631\u0624\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0646\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u0646 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Japan]], electronic music producer and DJ [[Yasutaka Nakata]] started to create a country-folk style of music for model and [[tarento|entertainer]] [[Mito Natsume]]. Mito's activities as a singer has yielded to her debut studio album, ''[[Natsumelo]],'' in 2017.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], country music has found their way into Cordilleran way of life, which often compares the [[Igorot]] lifestyle to that of American cowboys. [[Baguio]] City has a FM station that caters to country music, [[DZWR]] 99.9 Country, which is part of the [[Catholic Media Network]]. Bombo Radyo Baguio has a segment on its Sunday slot for Igorot, Ilocano and Country music.\n\n====Europe====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn [[Ireland]], [[TG4]] began a quest for Ireland's next country star called ''[[Gl\u00f3r T\u00edre]]'', translated as \"Country Voice\". It is now in its sixth season and is one of TG4's most-watched TV shows. Over the past ten years, country and gospel recording artist [[James Kilbane]] has reached multi-platinum success with his mix of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and traditional country influenced albums. James Kilbane like many other Irish artists is today working closer with Nashville. A recent success in the Irish arena has been [[Crystal Swing]]. In [[Sweden]], [[Rednex]] rose to stardom combining country music with [[synthpop|electro-pop]] in the 1990s. In 1994, the group had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune \"[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]\". Artists popularizing more traditional country music in Sweden have been [[Ann-Louise Hanson]], [[Hasse Andersson]], [[Kikki Danielsson]], [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] and [[Jill Johnson]]. In [[Poland]] an international country music festival, known as [[Piknik Country]], has been organized in [[Mr\u0105gowo]] in [[Masuria]] since 1983. There are more and more country music artists in France. Some of the most important are [[Liane Edwards]], {{ill|Annabel (singer)|lt=Annabel|fr|Annabel|vertical-align=sup}}, Rockie Mountains, Tahiana, and Lili West. French [[rock and roll]] superstar [[Eddy Mitchell]] is also very inspired by [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and country music. In the [[Netherlands]] there are many artists producing popular country and Americana music, which is mostly in the English language, as well as Dutch country and country-like music in the Dutch language. The latter is mainly popular on the countrysides in the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands and is less associated with his American brother, although it sounds sometimes very similar. Well known popular artists mainly performing in English are [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]], [[Danny Vera]], [[Ilse DeLange]], [[Douwe Bob]] and the band [[Savannah (band)|Savannah]]. The most popular artist in Dutch is [[Henk Wijngaard]].\n\n==Performers and shows==\n{{Main|List of country music performers|List of country performers by era|List of country television and radio shows}}\n\n===US cable television===\nSeveral U.S. TV networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|Country Music Television]] and [[CMT Music]] (both owned by [[ViacomCBS]]), [[RFD-TV]] and [[The Cowboy Channel]] (owned by Patrick Gottsch), [[Great American Country]] (owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]]), [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]] (owned by [[Reach High Media Group]]), and [[The Country Network]] (owned by TCN Country, LLC). An upcoming channel named Circle, a joint venture between [[Gray Television]] and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', will launch in 2020.\n\nThe first American country music video cable channel was [[The Nashville Network]], launched in the early 1980s as a channel devoted to southern culture. In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was stripped of its country format and rebranded as ''The National Network'', then ''Spike'', and finally [[Paramount Network]]. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts [[Crook & Chase]]) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.\n\n===Canadian television===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nOnly one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: [[CMT (Canada)|CMT]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, [[Canadian content|Cancom]]-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day [[Cottage Life (TV channel)|Cottage Life]] network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. [[Stingray Music]] continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on [[cable radio]].\n\nIn the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, [[CBC Television]]. The show ''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' significantly affected country music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched [[Anne Murray]]'s career. [[Gordie Tapp]]'s ''[[Country Hoedown]]'' and its successor, ''[[The Tommy Hunter Show]]'', ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.\n\n===Australian cable television===\nThe only network dedicated to country music in Australia is the [[Country Music Channel]] owned by [[Foxtel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===UK digital television===\nOne music channel is currently dedicated to country music in the United Kingdom: [[Spotlight TV]], owned by Canis Media.\n\n===Festivals===\n{{Main|List of country music festivals}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Academy of Country Music]]\n* [[American Country Countdown Awards]]\n* [[Canadian Country Music Association]]\n* [[Cajun music]]\n* [[CMT Music Awards]]\n* [[Country (identity)]]\n* [[Country Music Association]]\n* [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]]\n* [[Country and Irish]]\n* [[Country-western dance]]\n* [[Culture of the Southern United States]]\n* [[Grand Ole Opry]]\n* [[Great American Country]]\n* [[List of country genres]]\n* [[List of country music performers]]\n* [[List of RPM number-one country singles]]\n* [[Indigenous music of North America]]\n* [[M\u00fasica sertaneja]]\n* [[Music of the United States]]\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]\n* [[New Mexico music]]\n* [[Regional Mexican]]\n* [[Tejano music|Tejano]]\n* [[Western Music Association]]\n* [[Western music (North America)]]\n* [[WSM (AM)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book| last = Biracree| first = Tom| title = The country music almanac: Tom Biracree| year = 1993| publisher = Macmillan General Reference| isbn = 978-0-671-79761-4 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Dawidoff| first = Nicholas| title = In the Country of Country: A Journey to the Roots of American Music| date = 1998-04-28| publisher = Vintage| isbn = 978-0-375-70082-8 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Doggett| first = Peter| title = Are You Ready for the Country: Elvis, Dylan, Parsons and the Roots of Country Rock| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-14-026108-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Escott| first = Colin| title = Roadkill on the Three-Chord Highway: Art and Trash in American Popular Music| url = https://archive.org/details/roadkillonthreec00esco| url-access = registration| date = 2002-08-01| publisher = New York : Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-93783-2 }}\n*{{Gilliland |show=9 |title=Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Harris| first = Stacy| title = The Best of Country: The Essential Cd Guide| date = 1993-10-01| publisher = Collins Pub San Francisco| isbn = 978-0-00-255335-3 }}\n* Thomas S.

Its popularized roots originate in the [[Southern United States]] of the early 1920s.\n\nCountry music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as the African instrument [[banjo]]s, electric and [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s (such as [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steels]] and [[dobro]]s), and [[fiddle]]s as well as [[harmonica]]s.<ref name=\"dictionary\">{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/country+music |title=Country music \u2013 Definition |accessdate=2011-10-30 |dictionary=Dictionary.com}}</ref><ref name=\"dictionaryoxford\">{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/country+music |title=Country music \u2013 Definition |accessdate=2011-10-30 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909171326/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/country%2Bmusic |archivedate=9 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>Country music \u2013 Definition from WordWeb http://wordweb.info/free/</ref> [[Jazz scale#Blues scale|Blues modes]] have been used extensively throughout its [[recorded history]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Richard J.

Which developed into [[Appalachian music]] and eventual [[blues]] and [[bluegrass music]]. As the country expanded westward, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Louisiana]] became a crossroads for Country music, giving rise to [[Cajun music]].

[[Gid Tanner|James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner]] (1885\u20131960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the [[Skillet Lickers]], was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label [[Okeh Records]] began issuing hillbilly music records by [[Fiddlin' John Carson]] as early as 1923, followed by [[Columbia Records]] (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") ([[Samantha Bumgarner]]) in 1924, and [[RCA Victor Records]] in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the first family of country music [[Carter Family|The Carter Family]].<ref name=\"78discography.com\">[http://www.78discography.com/COL15000D.htm 78discography.com] ''The Online Discography Project''.</ref> Many \"hillbilly\" musicians, such as [[Cliff Carlisle]], recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.<ref name=\"Russell 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225\">{{cite book| last = Russell| first = Tony| title = Country Music Originals: The Legends and the Lost| date = 2007-11-15| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-532509-6| pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225]| url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the second generation (1930s\u20131940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring the king of the \"singing cowboys\", [[Gene Autry]]. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.<ref name=\"Takecountryback.com\">[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com], Merle Haggard \u2013 Bob Wills {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085028/http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".\n\nThe third generation (1950s\u20131960s) started at the end of [[World War II]] with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], which emerged when [[Bill Monroe]], along with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] were introduced by [[Roy Acuff]] at the Grand Ole Opry. [[Gospel music]] remained a popular component of country music. Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods, became popular among poor communities in [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]; the basic ensemble consisted of [[classical guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[dobro]] or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured [[electric guitar]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of [[tack piano]]), [[banjo]]s, and [[drum]]s. This sound had its roots in the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Hispanos|Hispano]], and [[American frontier]] music of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], including [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[Honky tonk music|honky tonk]], [[ranchera]], and [[corrido]]. By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music, with [[Johnny Cash]] emerging as one of the most popular and enduring representatives of the rockabilly genre; rockabilly was also a starting point for eventual rock-and-roll superstar [[Elvis Presley]], who would return to his country roots near the end of his life. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the [[Nashville sound]] turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]] were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the early 1950s, and during the mid-1960s, Western singer-songwriters such as [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and [[Marty Robbins]] rose in prominence as did others, throughout Western music traditions, like [[New Mexico music]]'s [[Al Hurricane]]. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].\n\nFourth generation (1970s\u20131980s) music included [[outlaw country]] with roots in the [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country pop]] with roots in the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]], folk music and [[soft rock]]. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist [[John Denver]] released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] gained popularity with performers like [[Freddie Fender]]. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production; this [[neotraditional country|neotraditional movement]] would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of [[George Strait]]. Attempts to combine [[Punk rock|punk]] and country were pioneered by [[Jason and the Scorchers]], and in the 1980s Southern Californian [[cowpunk]] scene with bands like [[the Long Ryders]] and [[Mojo Nixon]].\n\nDuring the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as [[Alan Jackson]], and the more broadly popular [[stadium rock|stadium country]] acts, in particular [[Garth Brooks]]. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe sixth generation (2000s\u2013present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. The influence of [[rock music]] in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were in the country pop genre, such as those by [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Taylor Swift]].<ref name=\"best-selling\" /> [[Hip-hop]] also made its mark on country music with the emergence of [[country rap]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/6150280/despite-hits-no-radio-love-yet-for-country-rap |title=Despite Hits, No Radio Love Yet For Country Rap |agency= Associated Press |magazine=Billboard |date= July 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===First generation (1920s)===\n[[File:Vernon Dalhart 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vernon Dalhart]] was the first country star to have a major hit record]]\n\nThe first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"[[The Arkansas Traveler (song)|Arkansas Traveler]]\" and \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & [[Eck Robertson|A.C.

Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. [[Patsy Montana]] opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. [[Cliff Bruner]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Milton Brown]] and [[Adolph Hofner]] were other early Western swing pioneers.

In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956.

By the early 1950s, a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, [[New Mexico music|New Mexico]], [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] rhythms of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", first recorded by [[Marty Robbins]] in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, Western musicians like [[Michael Martin Murphey]], [[New Mexico music]] artists [[Al Hurricane]] and [[Antonia Apodaca]], [[Tejano music]] performer [[Little Joe (singer)|Little Joe]], and even folk revivalist [[John Denver]], all first rose to prominence during this time. This Western music influence largely kept the music of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] and [[folk rock]] from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, [[The Byrds]]' negative reception during their appearance on the ''Grand Ole Opry''). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. Only a handful of folk artists, such as [[Burl Ives]] and Canadian musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]], would cross over into country music after the folk revival died out. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.<ref>{{cite book| last = Morrison| first = Craig| title = Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers| date = 1996-09-01| publisher = University of Illinois Press| isbn = 978-0-252-02207-4| page = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in [[Lubbock, Texas]].<ref name=hamilton>{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| last = Hamilton| first=Shane |title = Trucking Country: The Road to America's Wal-Mart Economy| journal = Trucking Country| pages = 187\u2013232| chapter = Agrarian Trucking Culture and Deregulatory Capitalism, 1960\u201380| date = 2008| jstor = j.ctt7t2vg.12| isbn = 9780691135823}}</ref> The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and [[History of the trucking industry in the United States|truckers]] in particular.

These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like \"ICC\" for [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and \"little white pills\" as a reference to [[amphetamines]].

Under the direction of producers such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], [[Owen Bradley]], [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]], and later [[Billy Sherrill]], the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a [[string section]] (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included [[Jim Reeves]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Connie Smith]], [[The Browns]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 10\u201311}} [[Patsy Cline]], and [[Eddy Arnold]]. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician [[Floyd Cramer]] was an important component of this style.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/floyd-cramer |title=Rockhall.com |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the [[British Invasion]] and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into [[countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Lynn Anderson]] and [[Charlie Rich]], as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[Marty Robbins]].

Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Anne Murray]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[The Bellamy Brothers]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\", \"[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]\", \"[[Annie's Song]]\", \"[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]\", and \"[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, [[Jean Shepard]] and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.\n[[File:Dolly Parton, 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dolly Parton]]]]\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again]]\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]], came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|The First Edition]], achieving success the same year with \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]\", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]] would also find success on the pop charts with their records. In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', \"Country music isn't really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hemphill | first1 = Paul | year = 1975 | title = Nashville\u2014Where It All Started | url = | journal = Saturday Evening Post | volume = 247 | issue = 3| pages = 44\u201386 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Juice Newton]] each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted \"[[Always on My Mind]]\" (No. 5, 1982) and \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\" (No. 5, 1984, a duet with [[Julio Iglesias]]), and Newton achieved success with \"[[Queen of Hearts (Hank DeVito song)|Queen of Hearts]]\" (No. 2, 1981) and \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\" (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the 1980s: \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\" by [[Kenny Rogers]], from the late fall of 1980; \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" by [[Dolly Parton]], \"[[I Love a Rainy Night]]\" by [[Eddie Rabbitt]] (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]]. Newton's \"Queen of Hearts\" almost reached No. 1, but was kept out of the spot by the pop ballad juggernaut \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\" by [[Diana Ross]] and [[Lionel Richie]].<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp Billboard.com], Historical Music Charts Archive. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803173648/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp |date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref> The move of country music toward neotraditional styles led to a marked decline in country/pop crossovers in the late 1980s, and only one song in that period\u2014[[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[You Got It]]\", from 1989\u2014made the top 10 of both the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]]\" and Hot 100 charts, due largely to a revival of interest in Orbison after his sudden death.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, \"Top Country Songs: 1944\u20132008,\" 2009.</ref><ref>Whitburn, Joel, \"Top Pop Singles: 1955\u20132006,\" 2007</ref> The only song with substantial country airplay to reach number one on the pop charts in the late 1980s was \"[[At This Moment]]\" by [[Billy Vera]] and the Beaters, an R&B song with slide guitar embellishment that appeared at number 42 on the country charts from minor crossover airplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1592928/old-town-road-is-only-the-third-country-song-in-30-years-to-make-it-to-make-it-to-no-1/|title=\"Old Town Road\" is only the third country song in 30 years to make it to make it to number one|first1=Dan|last1=Kopf|first2=Dan|last2=Kopf|website=Quartzy}}</ref> The record-setting, multi-platinum group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] was named Artist of the Decade for the 1980s by the Academy of Country Music.\n\n====Country rock====\n{{Main|Country rock}}\n{{see also|Cowpunk}}\n[[File:Eagles cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|A reunited [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] in 2008]]\n\nCountry rock is a genre that started in the 1960s but became prominent in the 1970s. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]]. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Dylan]], who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 54}} (and even more so with that album's follow-up, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''), followed by [[Gene Clark]], Clark's former band [[The Byrds]] (with [[Gram Parsons]] on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'') and its spin-off [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[The Monkees]] and the [[First National Band]]), the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], among many, even the former folk music duo [[Ian & Sylvia]], who formed [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] in 1969. The Eagles would become the most successful of these country rock acts, and their compilation album ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975)]]'' remains the second best-selling album of all time in the US with 29 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6844102/glenn-frey-eagles-biggest-billboard-hits|title= Glenn Frey & Eagles' Biggest Billboard Hits |date=January 18, 2016|author= Gary Trust |work=Billboard }}</ref> [[The Rolling Stones]] also got into the act with songs like \"[[Dead Flowers (The Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\" and a country version of \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\".\n\nDescribed by [[AllMusic]] as the \"father of country-rock\",<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com], Gram Parsons: Overview</ref> Gram Parsons' work in the early 1970s was acclaimed for its purity and for his appreciation for aspects of traditional country music.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/gramparsons Rollingstone.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429081141/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/gramparsons |date=April 29, 2009 }}</ref> Though his career was cut tragically short by his 1973 death, his legacy was carried on by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and duet partner [[Emmylou Harris]]; Harris would release her debut solo in 1975, an amalgamation of country, rock and roll, folk, blues and pop. Subsequent to the initial blending of the two polar opposite genres, other offspring soon resulted, including [[Southern rock]], [[heartland rock]] and in more recent years, [[alternative country]]. In the decades that followed, artists such as [[Juice Newton]], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] (and, to an even greater extent, [[Hank Williams III]]), [[Gary Allan]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] moved country further towards rock influence.\n\n====Neocountry====\nIn 1980, a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized by the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'',<ref name=\"Workin 1999. page 259\">{{cite book| author = Gerald W.

Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and [[The Judds]].\n\nBeginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. The arrival of exceptionally talented artists coincided with new marketing strategies to engage fans, technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. [[Garth Brooks]] (\"Friends in Low Places\") in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and [[arena rock|stadium rock]]. Other artists such as [[Brooks and Dunn]] (\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\") also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] updated neotraditionalist styles.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jocelyn R.|title=Country Music|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2224075|website=Oxford music online}}</ref>\n\n===Fifth generation (1990s)===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Garth Brooks at We Are One (edit).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Garth Brooks]]]]\n{{See also|1990s_in_music#Country_music|l1=1990s in music \u00a7 Country}}\n\nCountry music was aided by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Docket 80\u201390, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]] (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the [[classic country]] format for the AM audience). At the same time, [[beautiful music]] stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which had published a [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on [[country radio]] determined a song's place on the chart.<ref>{{cite journal|title=R&B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|journal=Billboard|date=24 April 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=Nielsen+Broadcast+Data+Systems+january+20+1990#v=onepage&q=Nielsen%20Broadcast%20Data%20Systems%20january%2020%201990&f=false|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=1992-08-19 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=1992-09-27 |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=1993-11-25 |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2010-07-26 | first=Jack | last=Hurst}}</ref> who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

[[Toby Keith]] began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the late 1990s with ''[[Pull My Chain]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]''.\n\n====Success of female artists====\nFemale artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Mindy McCready]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album ''[[Wide Open Spaces]]'' went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]]'s comments disparaging then-President [[George W. Bush]] while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the [[Iraq War]] a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall among non-country audiences but largely ignored among country audiences. After ''Taking the Long Way'', the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the [[Court Yard Hounds]]) before reuniting in 2016 and releasing new material in 2020.\n\n[[File:ShaniaTwain3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shania Twain]] performing during her [[Up! Tour]] in 2004]]\n\n[[Shania Twain]] became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, ''[[The Woman in Me (Shania Twain album)|The Woman in Me]]'', which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's ''[[Come On Over]]'', which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time.\n\nUnlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical '[[honky-tonk]]' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.\n\n====Line dancing revival====\nIn the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying, \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"<ref>The Roots of Country Music\" Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994</ref> By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as [[Don Williams]] and [[George Jones]] who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.\n\n====Alt-country/Americana====\n{{Main|Alt country|cowpunk}}\n\n[[File:WilcoFIB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Wilco]] performing in Spain in 2007]]\n\nCountry influences combined with [[Punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] to forge the \"[[cowpunk]]\" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as [[The Long Ryders]], [[Lone Justice]] and [[The Beat Farmers]], as well as the established punk group [[X (American band)|X]], whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.<ref name=\"Malone2002\">W.

Earle, in particular, was noted for his popularity with both country and [[college rock]] audiences: He promoted his 1986 debut album ''[[Guitar Town]]'' with a tour that saw him open for both country singer [[Dwight Yoakam]] and alternative rock band [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=Guitar Town \u2013 Steve Earle {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/guitar-town-mw0000189768|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Yoakam also cultivated a fanbase spanning multiple genres through his stripped-down [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] influenced sound, association with the cowpunk scene, and performances at Los Angeles punk rock clubs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Dwight Yoakam {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=7 August 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThese early styles had coalesced into a genre by the time the Illinois group [[Uncle Tupelo]] released their influential debut album ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'' in 1990.<ref name=smith2009>C.

[[Kid Rock]]'s collaboration with [[Sheryl Crow]], \"[[Picture (song)|Picture]],\" was a major crossover hit in 2001 and began Kid Rock's transition from hard rock to a country-rock hybrid that would later produce another major crossover hit, 2008's \"[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]].\" (Crow would also cross over into country with her hit \"[[Easy (Sheryl Crow song)|Easy]].\") [[Darius Rucker]], frontman for the 1990s pop-rock band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], began a country solo career in the late 2000s, one that to date has produced three albums and several hits on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Singer-songwriter [[Unknown Hinson]] became famous for his appearance in the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] television show ''Wild, Wild, South'', after which Hinson started his own band and toured in southern states.

Underwood's debut album, ''[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]'', became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the #1 Country Album of the 2000\u20132009 decade.

In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has listed Underwood as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].\nIn 2016, Underwood topped the [[Country Airplay]] chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.\n\n[[Carrie Underwood]] was one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s.

The series ''[[Nashville Star]]'', while not nearly as successful as ''Idol'', did manage to bring [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]] to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as [[Buddy Jewell]], [[Sean Patrick McGraw]], and Canadian musician [[George Canyon]]. ''[[Can You Duet]]?'' produced the duos [[Steel Magnolia]] and [[Joey + Rory]]. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress [[Jennette McCurdy]] (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom ''[[iCarly]]'') released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"[[Generation Love]]\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, [[Miley Cyrus]] (of ''[[Hannah Montana]]''), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]\" and another with a duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], with \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]].\" [[Jana Kramer]], an actress in the teen drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013.

Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]],\" was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Swift released her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]], which spent 275 weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', which made her the second longest number-one charted on ''Billboard'' 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'') within the past 5 years. At the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010 Grammys]], Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for ''Fearless'', which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] already. Buoyed by her [[teen idol]] status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and [[Hot Country Songs]] chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) were released solely to [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6228999/taylor-swift-country-music-split |title=Are Taylor Swift and Country Splitting Up for Good? |author= Jem Aswad |date= August 22, 2014 |work=Billboard }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/taylor-swift-country-pop-transformation-20140909 |title=Trace Taylor Swift's Country-to-Pop Transformation in 5 Song |author= Keith Harris |date=September 9, 2014 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/08/18/taylor-swift-shakes-off-country-with-first-pop-album-1989/14256849/ |title=Taylor Swift shakes off country with first pop album |author=Patrick Ryan and Brian Mansfield |work= USA TODAY |date= August 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight.

Artists like [[Tyler Childers]] have been increasing the popularity of this genre. Some may claim that his music is from the heart and you can feel what he is singing. The genre has developed in the [[Northern Kentucky]] and [[Cincinnati]] area. It is called bluegrass because of the type of grass that is in this area. Other artists include [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Osborne Brothers]], and many others.\n\n==== Country pop ====\n{{Main|Country pop}}\nIn the mid to late 2010s, country music began to increasingly sound more like the style of modern day [[Pop music|Pop]] music. Some modern artists that primarily or entirely produce [[country pop]] music include [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Sam Hunt]], [[Kane Brown]], [[Chris Lane]], and [[Dan + Shay]]. With more simple and repetitive lyrics, more electronic-based instrumentation and experimentation with \"talk-singing\" and rap, Pop-Country pulled farther away from the traditional sounds of country music. \n\nHowever, some newer artists have thrived despite using a more traditional country sound, such as [[Jon Pardi]] and [[Riley Green (singer)|Riley Green]]. [[Chris Stapleton]] earned acclaim during this period for his traditional-leaning country sound that fused elements of soul and rock.\n\n==International==\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Canadian country music|Canadian Country Music Association|Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame}}\n[[File:ShaniaTwainJunoAwardsMar2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Shania Twain in 2011]]\nOutside of the United States, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base, something that is to be expected given the two countries' proximity and cultural parallels. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]], the [[British Columbia Interior]], Ontario, and in [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Charles K. |author2=James Edward Akenson |title=The Women of Country Music |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=162=163}}</ref> [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] developed in Atlantic Canada in the form of Scottish, Acadian and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish, French and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Atlantic Provinces ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]]).<ref name=\"book\"/> Like the southern United States and [[Appalachia]], all four regions are of heavy [[British Isles]] stock and rural; as such, the development of traditional music in the Maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the US South and Appalachia. Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or \"[[sea shanty]]\" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and [[Music of Ireland|Irish]] in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.\n\n''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' was a [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. ''Don Messer's Jubilee'' followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named \"Goin' to the Barndance Tonight\", followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his \"Islanders\" including singers [[Marg Osburne]] and [[Charlie Chamberlain]], the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with \"[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]\".\n\nThe guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] and [[Catherine McKinnon]]. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. [[Hank Snow]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] (also known as Montana Slim), and [[Anne Murray]] are the three most notable.\n\nThe cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.<ref name=\"book\"/> While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]], [[Canadians of German ethnicity|German]] and others. For these reasons [[polka]]s and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the [[Folk music|folk]] or [[Celtic music|Celtic]] genres.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nMany traditional country artists are present in eastern and western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include [[Shania Twain]], [[Anne Murray]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[George Canyon]], [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Tommy Hunter]], [[Rita MacNeil]], [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Ronnie Prophet]], [[Carroll Baker (singer)|Carroll Baker]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Johnny Reid]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[Jason McCoy]], [[George Fox (singer)|George Fox]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Don Messer]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]], [[Michelle Wright]], [[Terri Clark]], [[Prairie Oyster]], [[Family Brown]], [[Johnny Mooring]], [[Marg Osburne]], [[Lindsay Ell]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans]], [[Crystal Shawanda]], [[Dean Brody]], [[Shane Yellowbird]], [[Gord Bamford]], [[Chad Brownlee]], [[The Road Hammers]], [[Brett Kissel]], [[Colter Wall]] and [[The Higgins]].\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Australian country music}}\n[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|[[Olivia Newton-John]] singing in [[Sydney]] in 2008]]\n\n[[Australian country music]] has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the guitar, [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.\n\nFolk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearers]], continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"[[bush band]] music\". \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include \"[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]\", \"[[Click Go the Shears]]\", \"The Queensland Drover\" and \"The Dying Stockman\". Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |title=Bush songs and music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406104520/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |archivedate=2011-04-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217020802/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |archivedate=2011-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nPioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] (known as \"The Father of Australian Country Music\") in the 1930s. Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], [[Shirley Thoms]] and [[Smoky Dawson]]. Buddy Williams (1918\u20131986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.\n\nIn 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. [[Slim Dusty]] (1927\u20132003) was known as the \"King of Australian Country Music\" and helped to popularise the Australian [[bush ballad]]. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave\" Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]].

It includes a number of different subgenres, depending on where they originated, and in what regions they are popular. One specific song style, the [[Ranchera]], found its origins in the Mexican countryside and was first popularized with [[Mariachi]]. It has since also become popular with [[Banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Duranguense]] and other regional Mexican styles. The [[Corrido]], a different song style with a similar history, is also performed in many different regional styles. Other song styles performed in regional Mexican music include [[Sentimental ballad|Ballad]]s, [[Cumbia]]s, [[Boleros]], among others. American-style country music is also popular in Mexico, but most prominently in the northern regions of the country, where a number of bands and solo artists perform the genre while singing in Spanish. It is known as Country en Espa\u00f1ol (Country in Spanish), and originated in the 1980s. It most resembles [[Neotraditional country]]. Famous bands include the likes of Wild West, Caballo Dorado (Golden Horse), and 8 Segundos (8 Seconds). [[Tejano music|Tejano]] (also known as \"Tex-Mex\" in English) is popular in Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, particularly in and near [[Texas]] (especially [[South Texas]]), and in northeastern areas of Mexico.\n \nIn [[Brazil]], there is [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|M\u00fasica Sertaneja]], a popular genre very similar to American country music, sharing its rich history of development in the countryside.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], on the last weekend of September, the yearly San Pedro Country Music Festival<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.country2.com |title=Country2.com |publisher=Country2.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> takes place in the town of [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires]].

Mito's activities as a singer has yielded to her debut studio album, ''[[Natsumelo]],'' in 2017.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], country music has found their way into Cordilleran way of life, which often compares the [[Igorot]] lifestyle to that of American cowboys. [[Baguio]] City has a FM station that caters to country music, [[DZWR]] 99.9 Country, which is part of the [[Catholic Media Network]]. Bombo Radyo Baguio has a segment on its Sunday slot for Igorot, Ilocano and Country music.\n\n====Europe====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn [[Ireland]], [[TG4]] began a quest for Ireland's next country star called ''[[Gl\u00f3r T\u00edre]]'', translated as \"Country Voice\". It is now in its sixth season and is one of TG4's most-watched TV shows. Over the past ten years, country and gospel recording artist [[James Kilbane]] has reached multi-platinum success with his mix of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and traditional country influenced albums. James Kilbane like many other Irish artists is today working closer with Nashville. A recent success in the Irish arena has been [[Crystal Swing]]. In [[Sweden]], [[Rednex]] rose to stardom combining country music with [[synthpop|electro-pop]] in the 1990s. In 1994, the group had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune \"[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]\". Artists popularizing more traditional country music in Sweden have been [[Ann-Louise Hanson]], [[Hasse Andersson]], [[Kikki Danielsson]], [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] and [[Jill Johnson]]. In [[Poland]] an international country music festival, known as [[Piknik Country]], has been organized in [[Mr\u0105gowo]] in [[Masuria]] since 1983. There are more and more country music artists in France. Some of the most important are [[Liane Edwards]], {{ill|Annabel (singer)|lt=Annabel|fr|Annabel|vertical-align=sup}}, Rockie Mountains, Tahiana, and Lili West. French [[rock and roll]] superstar [[Eddy Mitchell]] is also very inspired by [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and country music. In the [[Netherlands]] there are many artists producing popular country and Americana music, which is mostly in the English language, as well as Dutch country and country-like music in the Dutch language. The latter is mainly popular on the countrysides in the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands and is less associated with his American brother, although it sounds sometimes very similar. Well known popular artists mainly performing in English are [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]], [[Danny Vera]], [[Ilse DeLange]], [[Douwe Bob]] and the band [[Savannah (band)|Savannah]]. The most popular artist in Dutch is [[Henk Wijngaard]].\n\n==Performers and shows==\n{{Main|List of country music performers|List of country performers by era|List of country television and radio shows}}\n\n===US cable television===\nSeveral U.S. TV networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|Country Music Television]] and [[CMT Music]] (both owned by [[ViacomCBS]]), [[RFD-TV]] and [[The Cowboy Channel]] (owned by Patrick Gottsch), [[Great American Country]] (owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]]), [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]] (owned by [[Reach High Media Group]]), and [[The Country Network]] (owned by TCN Country, LLC). An upcoming channel named Circle, a joint venture between [[Gray Television]] and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', will launch in 2020.\n\nThe first American country music video cable channel was [[The Nashville Network]], launched in the early 1980s as a channel devoted to southern culture. In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was stripped of its country format and rebranded as ''The National Network'', then ''Spike'', and finally [[Paramount Network]]. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts [[Crook & Chase]]) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.\n\n===Canadian television===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nOnly one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: [[CMT (Canada)|CMT]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, [[Canadian content|Cancom]]-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day [[Cottage Life (TV channel)|Cottage Life]] network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. [[Stingray Music]] continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on [[cable radio]].\n\nIn the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, [[CBC Television]]. The show ''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' significantly affected country music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched [[Anne Murray]]'s career. [[Gordie Tapp]]'s ''[[Country Hoedown]]'' and its successor, ''[[The Tommy Hunter Show]]'', ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.\n\n===Australian cable television===\nThe only network dedicated to country music in Australia is the [[Country Music Channel]] owned by [[Foxtel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===UK digital television===\nOne music channel is currently dedicated to country music in the United Kingdom: [[Spotlight TV]], owned by Canis Media.\n\n===Festivals===\n{{Main|List of country music festivals}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Academy of Country Music]]\n* [[American Country Countdown Awards]]\n* [[Canadian Country Music Association]]\n* [[Cajun music]]\n* [[CMT Music Awards]]\n* [[Country (identity)]]\n* [[Country Music Association]]\n* [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]]\n* [[Country and Irish]]\n* [[Country-western dance]]\n* [[Culture of the Southern United States]]\n* [[Grand Ole Opry]]\n* [[Great American Country]]\n* [[List of country genres]]\n* [[List of country music performers]]\n* [[List of RPM number-one country singles]]\n* [[Indigenous music of North America]]\n* [[M\u00fasica sertaneja]]\n* [[Music of the United States]]\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]\n* [[New Mexico music]]\n* [[Regional Mexican]]\n* [[Tejano music|Tejano]]\n* [[Western Music Association]]\n* [[Western music (North America)]]\n* [[WSM (AM)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book| last = Biracree| first = Tom| title = The country music almanac: Tom Biracree| year = 1993| publisher = Macmillan General Reference| isbn = 978-0-671-79761-4 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Dawidoff| first = Nicholas| title = In the Country of Country: A Journey to the Roots of American Music| date = 1998-04-28| publisher = Vintage| isbn = 978-0-375-70082-8 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Doggett| first = Peter| title = Are You Ready for the Country: Elvis, Dylan, Parsons and the Roots of Country Rock| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-14-026108-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Escott| first = Colin| title = Roadkill on the Three-Chord Highway: Art and Trash in American Popular Music| url = https://archive.org/details/roadkillonthreec00esco| url-access = registration| date = 2002-08-01| publisher = New York : Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-93783-2 }}\n*{{Gilliland |show=9 |title=Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Harris| first = Stacy| title = The Best of Country: The Essential Cd Guide| date = 1993-10-01| publisher = Collins Pub San Francisco| isbn = 978-0-00-255335-3 }}\n* Thomas S.

{"title_page": "Cuban-American lobby", "text_new": "The '''Cuban-American lobby''' describes those various groups of [[Cuban exile]]s in the [[United States]] and their descendants who have historically influenced the United States' policy toward Cuba. In general usage this refers to anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] groups.\n\n==History and formation==\nThe Cuban-American lobby was formed by Cuban expatriates during migratory waves throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. In the 1960s, many Cubans left the island due to fear of revolutionary reforms. They were often white, wealthy, and/or supporters of the [[Fulgencio Batista]] dictatorship.<ref name=\"Canberk\">{{cite journal |last1=Ko\u00e7ak |first1=Canberk |title=Interest Groups and U.S. Foreign Policy towards Cuba: the Restoration of Capitalism in Cuba and the Changing Interest Group Politics |url=http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=classracecorporatepower |journal=Class, Race and Corporate Power |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= |doi=10.25148/CRCP.4.2.001664 |access-date=March 8, 2018 |year=2017 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Hardships in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s also encouraged expatriation motivated by economic prospects in the U.S. The ideological makeup of the lobby shifted drastically after [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] lifted travel restrictions in 2013. The group constituting this exodus was young and much more moderate than earlier groups. This demographic is one of the most geographically concentrated of immigrant groups in the United States. Many Cuban expatriates have followed family and friends to the U.S. and built a \"Second Havana\" in Miami.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Makeup of the lobby==\nThe Cuban-American lobby is usually seen to be anti-Castro and recognizing the Cuban government as repressive, although it has become much more moderate since the late 1990s. However, the most influential organizations and politicians within the political sector of the lobby are still conservative. They advocate for punitive maintenance of the embargo. It should be lifted, then, only if Cuba moves toward democratization and greater respect for human rights, shifts towards a more capitalist economy and makes strides in economic privatization.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite journal |last1=Haney |first1=Patrick J. |date=June 1999 |title=The Role of Ethnic Interest Groups in U.S. Foreign Policy: The Case of the Cuban American National Foundation\n |jstor=2600759|journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=341\u2013361 |doi= 10.1111/0020-8833.00123}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1945.html |title= Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 |publisher= U.S. Department of State |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120805204524/http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html |archivedate= August 5, 2012 }} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/895774495 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895774135 cite #3 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref> The most notable organization with this viewpoint is the [[Cuban American National Foundation]]. Less influential organizations advocate for an easing or lifting of the embargo before or regardless of whether Cuba changes its government structure and policies.\n\nThe academic circles within the lobby, though not monolithic in opinion, generally believe that the U.S. and Cuba should more readily exchange scientific information and advances. Some organizations within the intellectual wing of the Cuba lobby advocate for travel as a human right, and have affected change on U.S. travel policies towards Cuba.<ref name=\"Horowitz\">https://{{cite journal |last1=Horowitz |first1=Irving Louis |date=Autumn 1998 |title=The Cuba Lobby Then and Now |journal=Orbis |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=553\u2013563 |doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(98)80005-7 }}</ref>\n\nBusiness interest lobbies often advocate for lifting the embargo so as to increase trade between the two nations. They believe trade with Cuba would be beneficial for the U.S. economy, and usually point more to financial than humanitarian reasons for their stance.<ref name=\"Horowitz\"/> Lobbies outside the Cuban-American community have also advocated for liberalization of trade between the two nations, most notably the agribusiness lobby.<ref name=\"Canberk\"/>\n\n==Political influence==\nIn the 1980s, most Cuban expatriate interest groups were only active in southern Florida. These groups were splintered and their voice was poorly organized. The lobby became more powerful after many organizations pledged to change the inner workings of Cuban government, as powers within the U.S. government shared the same objective. The [[Reagan administration]] strongly supported the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] (CANF), which formed the month the president took office.<ref name=\"Haney\"/> The lobby built institutional ties with the administration through their ideological sameness, giving conservative Cuban-American groups growing influence and increasingly early access to information through the 1980s.<br>Organizations within the lobby have affected public policy by collaborating with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. One of the most notable collaborations occurred in 1992 between the Cuban American National Foundation and Democrat [[Robert Torricelli]]. Torricelli, whose liberal views on the embargo characterized his early career, sought election campaign funds from the CANF. He adopted a stronger anti-Castro, pro-embargo stance, secured CANF funds, and was reelected to Congress.<ref name=Canberk/> Torricelli subsequently sponsored the [[Cuban Democracy Act]], often referred to as the Torricelli Act, which was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992.\n\nThe conservative lobby\u2019s influence waned when [[Jorge Mas Canosa]], founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, died in 1997. The international custody case of [[Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], which lasted from November 1999 to June 2000, also had negative effects on conservative influence within the Cuban-American community. The rise of moderate and liberal influence within the community are often partially attributed to Canosa\u2019s death and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s repatriation into Cuba.<ref name=Canberk/><br>While still influential, the Cuba lobby appears to be weakening due to dissenting opinions within groups.<ref name=\"Lindsay\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/getting-uncle-sams-ear-will-ethnic-lobbies-cramp-americas-foreign-policy-style/\n |title=Getting Uncle Sam's Ear: Will Ethnic Lobbies Cramp America's Foreign Policy Style\n |last=Lindsay\n |first=James M.\n |date=December 2002\n |website=Brookings.edu\n |publisher=Brookings\n |access-date=February 10, 2018\n |quote= }}/</ref> Younger Cuban-Americans are more likely to be open-minded regarding relations between the two countries and the lifting of the embargo.\n\nRising influence of moderate voices allowed room for the agribusiness lobby to push for reforms that softened the embargo. The lobby campaigned for the [[Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act|Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]], with success partially due to conflict within the Cuban-American community after the death of Canosa and the case of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. The law allowed for the trade of some agricultural and medical goods between the two nations.<ref name=Canberk/>\nA more persuasive reason for the agribusiness lobby\u2019s success and the rise of moderate and liberal voices is the recent economic reforms instituted by Ra\u00fal Castro. For instance, the proportion of state-owned agricultural land has fallen from 75% in 1992 to 20.7% in 2012.<ref name=Canberk/>\n\n===Effect of the lobby's campaign contributions===\nA [[logistic regression|logistic regression model]] analyzed Congress members' attitudes towards two nearly identical pieces of pro-embargo legislation before and after receiving campaign funds from the Cuban-American Lobby groups.

In general usage this refers to anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] groups.\n\n==History and formation==\nThe Cuban-American lobby was formed by Cuban expatriates during migratory waves throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. In the 1960s, many Cubans left the island due to fear of revolutionary reforms. They were often white, wealthy, and/or supporters of the [[Fulgencio Batista]] dictatorship.<ref name=\"Canberk\">{{cite journal |last1=Ko\u00e7ak |first1=Canberk |title=Interest Groups and U.S. Foreign Policy towards Cuba: the Restoration of Capitalism in Cuba and the Changing Interest Group Politics |url=http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=classracecorporatepower |journal=Class, Race and Corporate Power |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= |doi=10.25148/CRCP.4.2.001664 |access-date=March 8, 2018 |year=2017 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Hardships in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s also encouraged expatriation motivated by economic prospects in the U.S. The ideological makeup of the lobby shifted drastically after [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] lifted travel restrictions in 2013. The group constituting this exodus was young and much more moderate than earlier groups. This demographic is one of the most geographically concentrated of immigrant groups in the United States. Many Cuban expatriates have followed family and friends to the U.S. and built a \"Second Havana\" in Miami.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Makeup of the lobby==\nThe Cuban-American lobby is usually seen to be anti-Castro and recognizing the Cuban government as repressive, although it has become much more moderate since the late 1990s. However, the most influential organizations and politicians within the political sector of the lobby are still conservative. They advocate for punitive maintenance of the embargo. It should be lifted, then, only if Cuba moves toward democratization and greater respect for human rights, shifts towards a more capitalist economy and makes strides in economic privatization.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite journal |last1=Haney |first1=Patrick J. |date=June 1999 |title=The Role of Ethnic Interest Groups in U.S. Foreign Policy: The Case of the Cuban American National Foundation\n |jstor=2600759|journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=341\u2013361 |doi= 10.1111/0020-8833.00123}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1945.html |title= Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 |publisher= U.S. Department of State |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120805204524/http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html |archivedate= August 5, 2012 }} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/895774495 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895774135 cite #3 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref> The most notable organization with this viewpoint is the [[Cuban American National Foundation]]. Less influential organizations advocate for an easing or lifting of the embargo before or regardless of whether Cuba changes its government structure and policies.\n\nThe academic circles within the lobby, though not monolithic in opinion, generally believe that the U.S. and Cuba should more readily exchange scientific information and advances. Some organizations within the intellectual wing of the Cuba lobby advocate for travel as a human right, and have affected change on U.S. travel policies towards Cuba.<ref name=\"Horowitz\">https://{{cite journal |last1=Horowitz |first1=Irving Louis |date=Autumn 1998 |title=The Cuba Lobby Then and Now |journal=Orbis |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=553\u2013563 |doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(98)80005-7 }}</ref>\n\nBusiness interest lobbies often advocate for lifting the embargo so as to increase trade between the two nations. They believe trade with Cuba would be beneficial for the U.S. economy, and usually point more to financial than humanitarian reasons for their stance.<ref name=\"Horowitz\"/> Lobbies outside the Cuban-American community have also advocated for liberalization of trade between the two nations, most notably the agribusiness lobby.<ref name=\"Canberk\"/>\n\n==Political influence==\nIn the 1980s, most Cuban expatriate interest groups were only active in southern Florida. These groups were splintered and their voice was poorly organized. The lobby became more powerful after many organizations pledged to change the inner workings of Cuban government, as powers within the U.S. government shared the same objective. The [[Reagan administration]] strongly supported the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] (CANF), which formed the month the president took office.<ref name=\"Haney\"/> The lobby built institutional ties with the administration through their ideological sameness, giving conservative Cuban-American groups growing influence and increasingly early access to information through the 1980s.<br>Organizations within the lobby have affected public policy by collaborating with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. One of the most notable collaborations occurred in 1992 between the Cuban American National Foundation and Democrat [[Robert Torricelli]]. Torricelli, whose liberal views on the embargo characterized his early career, sought election campaign funds from the CANF. He adopted a stronger anti-Castro, pro-embargo stance, secured CANF funds, and was reelected to Congress.<ref name=Canberk/> Torricelli subsequently sponsored the [[Cuban Democracy Act]], often referred to as the Torricelli Act, which was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992.\n\nThe conservative lobby\u2019s influence waned when [[Jorge Mas Canosa]], founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, died in 1997. The international custody case of [[Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], which lasted from November 1999 to June 2000, also had negative effects on conservative influence within the Cuban-American community. The rise of moderate and liberal influence within the community are often partially attributed to Canosa\u2019s death and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s repatriation into Cuba.<ref name=Canberk/><br>While still influential, the Cuba lobby appears to be weakening due to dissenting opinions within groups.<ref name=\"Lindsay\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/getting-uncle-sams-ear-will-ethnic-lobbies-cramp-americas-foreign-policy-style/\n |title=Getting Uncle Sam's Ear: Will Ethnic Lobbies Cramp America's Foreign Policy Style\n |last=Lindsay\n |first=James M.\n |date=December 2002\n |website=Brookings.edu\n |publisher=Brookings\n |access-date=February 10, 2018\n |quote= }}/</ref> Younger Cuban-Americans are more likely to be open-minded regarding relations between the two countries and the lifting of the embargo.\n\nRising influence of moderate voices allowed room for the agribusiness lobby to push for reforms that softened the embargo. The lobby campaigned for the [[Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act|Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]], with success partially due to conflict within the Cuban-American community after the death of Canosa and the case of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. The law allowed for the trade of some agricultural and medical goods between the two nations.<ref name=Canberk/>\nA more persuasive reason for the agribusiness lobby\u2019s success and the rise of moderate and liberal voices is the recent economic reforms instituted by Ra\u00fal Castro. For instance, the proportion of state-owned agricultural land has fallen from 75% in 1992 to 20.7% in 2012.<ref name=Canberk/>\n\n===Effect of the lobby's campaign contributions===\nA [[logistic regression|logistic regression model]] analyzed Congress members' attitudes towards two nearly identical pieces of pro-embargo legislation before and after receiving campaign funds from the Cuban-American Lobby groups.
