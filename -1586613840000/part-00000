Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Henceforth, most of the Metal Heroes are also referenced as another of those of the \"[[Henshin]] (transforming) Heroes\" genre. Usually, the genre revolves around a technological theme where technology, in the right hands, can be used for the greater good.\n\nThe shows were produced by [[Toei Company|Toei]] from 1982 through 1999 in conjunction with their other Tokusatsu superhero shows, ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'' and ''[[Super Sentai]]''. In addition to [[Japan]], they are also popular in [[France]], [[Brazil]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].

In 1988, ''Juspion'' (as ''Jaspion'') was broadcast by [[Rede Manchete|TV Manchete]]. Manchete followed with ''Jiraiya'' in 1989, ''Jiban'' in 1990, ''Spielvan'' (renamed ''Jaspion 2'') in 1991, ''Winspector'' in 1994 and ''Solbrain'' in 1995. Other networks also bought shows, with [[TV Bandeirantes]] broadcasting ''Metalder'' and ''Sharivan'' in 1990 and two networks ([[Rede Globo]] and [[TV Gazeta]]) airing ''Sheider'' and ''Gavan'' (renamed ''Gyaban'') in 1991. ''Jaspion'', ''Jiraiya'' and ''Jiban'' were later released on DVD in the country.\n\nUntil 2016, most of the series that were released in Brazilian television in 80's and 90's are going to [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video]] and [[Playplus]] in Brazil. The distribution company Sato Company acquired many of those series and negotiated with [[Netflix]]. Also, some new products like Garo series are in these negotiations too.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusivo: S\u00e9ries Tokusatsu na Netflix|url=http://www.jbox.com.br/2015/05/25/exclusivo-series-tokusatsu-na-netflix/}}</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nOther similar heroes, such as ''[[Nebula Mask Machine Man]]'', ''[[Kyodai Ken Byclosser]]'' and ''[[Choukou Senshi Chang\u00e9r\u00edon]]'', were also produced during the time that the Metal Hero Series were on the air, but are not included as part of the Metal Hero Series for various reasons. ''Machine Man'' and ''Bicrosser'' were created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], while Chang\u00e9r\u00edon's armor is not metallic.\n\nCurrently, the Metal Hero Series were one of Toei's defunct genres as the company rather favors more of the [[Super Sentai]] and [[Kamen Rider Series]] of shows and allegedly the passing of Shotaro Ishinomori. Although, many of the Metal Hero traits have been adopted into the new generation of Super Sentai and Kamen Rider shows. Today, the present versions of these type of heroes are also merged in with the [[Henshin Heroes]] description.\n\nSome Metal Heroes have also made cameo appearances. In 2004, a special ''[[Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger]]'' stage show had a special appearance by Gavan, who assisted Hurricane Red from ''[[Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger]]'' and Aba Red from ''[[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]]'' in battling various Alienizer monsters from ''Deka Ranger''.\n\nIn 2005, Toei released some ''Uchuu Keiji'' trilogy merchandise. Later that year, Bandai released a \"Souchaku Henshin\" figure of Gavan, followed by \"Souchaku Henshin\" figures of Sharivan and Shaider in early 2006. In May 2006, a [[PlayStation 2]] video game titled ''[[The Space Sheriff Spirits]]'' was released. The game featured Gavan, Sharivan and Shaider all teaming up to battle past enemies from their series. The game was panned by critics, however, for bland graphics and dull gameplay.{{Original research inline|date=November 2007}} In early 2008, the trading card company Cardass announced a new, Metal Heroes based expansion to their ''[[Rangers Strike]]'' card game, entitled ''Special Metal Edition'', featuring characters and vehicles from the various Metal Hero Series for use within the game.\n\nDespite no more television series having been made, the Space Sheriff Series re-emerged in the 2010s with feature films, including new actors portraying successors to Gavan, Sharivan, and Shaider. Some of them are stand alone entries, while others feature crossovers with other Super Sentai and Kamen Rider characters.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Metal Hero Series|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Tokusatsu]]\n[[Category:Metal Hero Series|*]]\n[[Category:Bandai brands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox media franchise  \n|image=   \n|image caption=   \n|title=''Metal Hero Series''  \n|creator=[[Toei Company]]<br>\u221f [[Toei Company#Saburo Yatsude|Sabur\u014d Yatsude]]\n|origin=''[[Space Sheriff Gavan]]''\n|films=''[[Space Sheriff Gavan: The Movie]]''<br />''Space Sheriff Sharivan: Next Generation''<br />''Space Sheriff Shaider: Next Generation''\n|tv=[[#List of Metal Hero Series|See below]]\n|plays=   \n|musicals=   \n|games=''[[Rangers Strike]]''\n|rpgs=\n|vgs=''[[The Space Sheriff Spirits]]''  \n|books=   \n|novels=\n|comics=\n|magazines=\n|strips=\n|radio=\n|soundtracks=\n|music=\n|toys= Souchaku Henshin<br>S.H.

Also, some new products like Garo series are in these negotiations too.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusivo: S\u00e9ries Tokusatsu na Netflix|url=http://www.jbox.com.br/2015/05/25/exclusivo-series-tokusatsu-na-netflix/}}</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nOther similar heroes, such as ''[[Nebula Mask Machine Man]]'', ''[[Kyodai Ken Byclosser]]'' and ''[[Choukou Senshi Chang\u00e9r\u00edon]]'', were also produced during the time that the Metal Hero Series were on the air, but are not included as part of the Metal Hero Series for various reasons. ''Machine Man'' and ''Bicrosser'' were created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], while Chang\u00e9r\u00edon's armor is not metallic.\n\nCurrently, the Metal Hero Series were one of Toei's defunct genres as the company rather favors more of the [[Super Sentai]] and [[Kamen Rider Series]] of shows and allegedly the passing of Shotaro Ishinomori. Although, many of the Metal Hero traits have been adopted into the new generation of Super Sentai and Kamen Rider shows. Today, the present versions of these type of heroes are also merged in with the [[Henshin Heroes]] description.\n\nSome Metal Heroes have also made cameo appearances. In 2004, a special ''[[Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger]]'' stage show had a special appearance by Gavan, who assisted Hurricane Red from ''[[Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger]]'' and Aba Red from ''[[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]]'' in battling various Alienizer monsters from ''Deka Ranger''.\n\nIn 2005, Toei released some ''Uchuu Keiji'' trilogy merchandise. Later that year, Bandai released a \"Souchaku Henshin\" figure of Gavan, followed by \"Souchaku Henshin\" figures of Sharivan and Shaider in early 2006. In May 2006, a [[PlayStation 2]] video game titled ''[[The Space Sheriff Spirits]]'' was released. The game featured Gavan, Sharivan and Shaider all teaming up to battle past enemies from their series. The game was panned by critics, however, for bland graphics and dull gameplay.{{Original research inline|date=November 2007}} In early 2008, the trading card company Cardass announced a new, Metal Heroes based expansion to their ''[[Rangers Strike]]'' card game, entitled ''Special Metal Edition'', featuring characters and vehicles from the various Metal Hero Series for use within the game.\n\nDespite no more television series having been made, the Space Sheriff Series re-emerged in the 2010s with feature films, including new actors portraying successors to Gavan, Sharivan, and Shaider. Some of them are stand alone entries, while others feature crossovers with other Super Sentai and Kamen Rider characters.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Metal Hero Series|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Tokusatsu]]\n[[Category:Metal Hero Series|*]]\n[[Category:Bandai brands]]\n", "name_user": "Ryusoul", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Hero_Series"}

Tillotson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings.

He states that Oak interprets the statements of ''[[Padshahnama]]'' about Shah Jahan's purchase of the land for the Taj from [[Jai Singh I]] upon where a mansion built by an ancestor of the Raja earlier existed, to claim that Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism. Tillotson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings. In relation to similarity with buildings of [[West Asia]], Oak also claims them all to be \"products of Hindu architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4zYd848UJkC&pg=PA115|author=Giles Tillotson|title=Taj Mahal|pages=112\u2013114|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|year=2008|author-link=Giles Tillotson|isbn=9780674031869}}</ref>\n===Kaaba Theory: Vedic origins===\n{{See also|Kaaba#Pre-Islamic Era}}\nIn a 13-page pamphlet titled ''Was Kaaba a Hindu Temple?'', Oak derives a claim of a \"Vedic past of Arabia\" based on an inscription mentioning the legendary Indian king [[Vikram\u0101ditya]] that Oak claims was found inside a dish inside the Kaaba.
