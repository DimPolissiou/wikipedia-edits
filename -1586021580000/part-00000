There remain, as of 2016, twelve (12) sovereign '''monarchies in Europe'''. Seven are [[Realm|kingdoms]]: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Monaco]] are [[Principality|principalities]], while Luxembourg is a [[Grand duchy|Grand Duchy]]. The [[Vatican City]] is a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] state ruled by the [[Pope]].\n\nThe monarchies can be divided into two broad classes: pre-modern states and those that gained their independence during or immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden the UK, Spain, and Andorra are the successors to pre-modern monarchies. Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were established or gained independence through various methods during the Napoleonic Wars. The [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]] was recognized as a sovereign state administered by the [[Holy See]] in 1929. \n\nTen of these monarchies are [[Hereditary title|hereditary]], and two are elective: Vatican City (the Pope, elected at the [[papal conclave]]), and [[Andorra]] (technically a semi-elective diarchy, the joint heads of state being the elected [[President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]], appointed by the Pope).\n\nMost of the monarchies in Europe are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. The exceptions are [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]], which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and Vatican City, which is a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]]. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see [[monarchism]] and [[republicanism]]) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] in the United Kingdom). Currently six of the twelve monarchies are members of the [[European Union]]: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and [[San Marino]] were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of [[republicanism]] to the political [[mainstream]] started only at the beginning of the 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the [[Sovereign state|states]] in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected [[head of state]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|Map of [[Mycenaean Greece]].]]\nThe notion of kingship in Europe ultimately originates in systems of [[tribal kingship]] in [[prehistoric Europe]]. The [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 1400 BCE) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in [[protohistory|protohistoric]] Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the [[Linear B]] script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about society in the Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of [[palace economy|palace economies]].<ref name=\"Blois71\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 71\u201372.</ref> The role of kings changed in the following [[Greek Dark Ages]] (c. 1100 \u2013 c. 750 BCE) to big [[gentleman farmer]]s with military power.<ref name=\"Blois71\"/>\n\n=== Archaic and classical antiquity ===\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|left|thumb|The [[Pnyx]], as [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|meeting place]] the heart of [[Athenian democracy]].]]\nSince the beginning of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was in the hands of a number of people that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (c. 750\u2013500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek [[Polis|poleis]],<ref name=\"Blois74\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 74.</ref> and [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|also in Rome]] (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility ([[aristocracy]]), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations ([[tyranny]], 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy ([[oligarchy]]) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in [[Classical Greece]] (mainly after 500 BCE).<ref name=\"Blois86\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 86\u201387.</ref> [[Athenian democracy]] (6th century\u2013322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; [[Sparta|classical Sparta]] (c. 550\u2013371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy ([[List of kings of Sparta|dual kingship]]), aristocracy ([[Gerousia]]) and democracy ([[Apella]]);<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"geronten\".</ref> the [[Roman Republic]] (c. 509\u201327 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Romeinse Rijk. \u00a72. Staatsinstellingen\".</ref> The city-states of the [[Etruscan civilization]] (which arose during the [[Villanovan culture|Villanovan period]], c. 900\u2013700 BCE) appear to have followed a similar pattern, with the original monarchies being overthrown and replaced by oligarchic republics in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.<ref name=\"KandG Etruscans\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkySjRwUteE |title=Etruscans: Italian Civilization Before Ancient Rome |author=Leo Stone, Ilkin Gambar, Officially Devin, Nolan Karimov, Andr\u00e1s Szente-Dzsida |work=Kings and Generals |publisher=YouTube |date=20 February 2020 |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>{{rp|at=8:18}}\n\n[[File:Tetradrachm of Philip II. 359-336 BCE.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian king]] [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] united all Greek poleis under his crown in 338 BCE.]]\nThe dominant poleis of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and Sparta were weakened by warring each other, especially during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BCE) won by Sparta. They were defeated and ruled by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] for a time (371\u2013360 BCE), after which Sparta's role was over. Eventually, all of Greece was subjugated by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian monarchy]] in 338 BCE, that put an end to the era of free autonomous city-states, and Athenian democracy as well in 322 BCE.<ref>De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 103\u2013106.</ref> In the subsequent [[Hellenistic period]] (334\u201330 BCE)<ref name=\"Encarta\">Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"hellenisme\".</ref> numerous [[diadoch]]s (successors of [[Alexander the Great]]) fought one another for the kingship of Macedon, definitively obtained by the [[Antigonids]] in 277 BCE.<ref name=\"Blois127\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 127.</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Phoenicia]]n city-state of [[Carthage]], located in present-day [[Tunisia]], aside from settling large swaths of North Africa's coast, also set up several colonies on [[Sicily]], Sardinia, Corsica, the [[Balearic Islands|Baleares]] and in [[Carthaginian Iberia|southern Iberia]].<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Carthago. \u00a71. Geschiedenis\".</ref> The Carthaginian empire, according to tradition founded in 814 BCE, started out as a monarchy, but in the 4th century transformed into a republic where [[Shophet|suffets]] (\"judges\") ruled. Finally, Rome gradually conquered all of Italy (primarily after 350 BCE), and defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BCE). In 168, Macedon was [[Macedonian Wars|subdued by the Romans]], and partitioned into four client republics. These were annexed as Roman provinces in 148, as happened to Greece in 146,<ref name=\"Blois127\"/> making Rome's territory envelop all of literate Europe. The remainder of Iberia, the Illyrian coast and eventually [[Gaul]] by general [[Julius Caesar]] were added to the Roman Republic, which however was experiencing an institutional crisis. After defeating his rival [[Pompey]], Caesar was appointed ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' to restore order. He almost managed to found a dynasty in the process, but was killed by a republican cabal led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in 44 BCE.\n\n=== Roman Empire and legacy ===\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|The first Roman Emperor, [[Augustus]] ([[r.]] 27 BCE\u201314 CE).]]\nCaesar's adoptive son Octavian prevailed in the ensuing civil war, and converted the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BCE. He took on the name [[Augustus]], with the rather humble title of [[princeps]] (\"first [citizen]\"), as if he were merely ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\"), when he had in fact founded a monarchy. This limited emperorship ([[Principate]]) was strengthened in 284 by [[Diocletian]] to absolute reign ([[Dominate]]).<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Diocletianus, Gaius Aurelius Valerius.\"</ref> The Empire recognised various [[client kingdom]]s under imperial suzerainty; most of these were in Asia, but tribal client kings were also recognized by the Roman authorities [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|in Britannia]]. Most of the [[barbarian kingdoms]] established in the 5th century \n(the kingdoms of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi]], [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundi]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[kingdom of the Franks|Franks]], [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]]) recognised the Roman Emperor at least nominally, and Germanic kingdoms would continue to mint coins depicting the Roman emperor well into the 6th century.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'' (1937), 46&ndash;48.</ref>\nIt was this derivation of the authority of kingship from the Christian Roman Empire that would be at the core of the medieval institution of kingship in Europe and its notion of the [[divine right of kings]], as well as the position of the Pope in [[Latin Christendom]], the restoration of the Roman Empire under [[Charlemagne]] and the derived concept of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western and Central Europe.\n\n===Medieval Europe===\nThe monarchies of Europe in the Christian [[Middle Ages]] derived their claim from [[Christianisation]] and the [[divine right of kings]], partly influenced by the notion of [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]] inherited from [[Germanic antiquity]].\nThe [[great power]]s of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]] were the result of a gradual process of centralization of power taking place over the course of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe [[Early Middle Ages]] begin with a fragmentation of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] into \"[[barbarian kingdoms]]\". In Western Europe, the kingdom of the [[Franks]] developed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] by the 8th century, and the [[Heptarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] were unified into the [[kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. \nWith the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of [[feudalism]] places kings at the head of a pyramid of relationships between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of [[baron]]s, and the intermediate positions of [[counts]] (or [[earl]]s) and [[duke]]s. The core of European feudal [[manorialism]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] were the territories of the [[kingdom of France]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (centered on the nominal kingdoms of [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]) and the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].\n\n===Early Modern Europe===\n\n[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|European dominions of the House of Habsburg in 1700]]\nWith the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]], the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of [[James I of England]] (1603\u20131625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567\u20131625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\n[[Early modern Europe]] was dominated by the [[Wars of Religion]], notably the [[Thirty Years' War]], during which the major European monarchies developed into centralised [[great power]]s sustained by their [[colonial empire]]s.\nThe main European powers in the early modern period were:\n*the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] with its [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]]\n*the [[Portuguese Empire]] of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Iberian Union|personal union with Spain]] 1580&ndash;1640)\n*the [[Spanish Empire]] of [[Habsburg Spain]] (after 1700 [[Bourbon Spain]])\n*the [[British Empire]] of the English and Scottish [[Union of the Crowns]] (after 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]])\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was increasingly dominated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and by [[Prussia]]\n*the [[Tsardom of Russia]]\n*the kingdom of Poland as the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n*the kingdom of Sweden rose to the status of great power as the comparatively short-lived [[Swedish Empire]] due to the Thirty Years' War \n*the kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]]\n\nThe [[House of Habsburg]] became the most influential royal dynasty in continental Europe by the 17th century, divided into the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] branches.\n\n===Modern Europe===\n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|Map of Europe in 1815]]\nThe modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649, followed by the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u201383) and especially the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399). The absolutist [[Kingdom of France]] was first transformed to a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy (1791\u201392)]], before being [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fully abolished]] on 21 September 1792, and eventually the [[Execution of Louis XVI|former king even executed]], to the other European courts' great shock. During the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131799), the great European monarchies were unable to restore the monarchy; instead, the [[French First Republic]] expanded and annexed neighbouring territories, or converted them into loyal [[sister republic]]s. Meanwhile, the [[German Mediatization]] of 1803 thoroughly rearranged the political structure of the Holy Roman Empire, with many small principalities and all ecclesiastical lands being annexed by larger monarchies. After [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|Napoleon seized power]], however, he gradually constructed a new imperial order in French-controlled Europe, first by [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning himself Emperor of the French]] in 1804, and then converting the sister republics into monarchies ruled by his relatives.\n\nFollowing Napoleon's defeat in 1814 and 1815, the reactionary [[Congress of Vienna]] determined that all of Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon dynasty was restored]], replaced by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The popular [[Napoleon III]] was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the [[Second French Empire]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|\"Two Sicilies\"]]) were absorbed into the [[kingdom of Sardinia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with [[Austro-Prussian War|Prussia emerging victorious]] in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, [[Franco-Prussian War|defeat France]] and absorb the southern German states into the [[German Empire]] in the process (1870\u201371). From the ashes of the Second Empire rose the [[French Third Republic]], the only great republican European power until World War I.\n\nMuch of 19th century politics was characterised by the division between [[republicanism|anti-monarchist]] [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] [[conservatism]]. \nThe Kingdom of Spain was [[First Spanish Republic|briefly abolished]] in 1873, [[Restoration (Spain)|restored]] 1874&ndash;1931 and again [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|in 1978]].\nThe [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was abolished in 1910. The [[Russian Empire]] ended in 1917, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1918.\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] fell [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|under Habsburg rule]] in 1867 and was dissolved in 1918 ([[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|restored]] 1920\u20131946). Likewise, the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] under Habsburg rule was dissolved in 1918.\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] transformed the political landscape of Europe, and a number of modern kingdoms were formed in a resurgence of monarchism after the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]:\n\n*{{flagicon|Austria|variant=empire}} the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] (1804\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|W\u00fcrttemberg}} the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Bavaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1805 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Saxony}} the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (1806&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1816).svg}} the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] (1808\u20131861)\n*{{flagicon|France|variant=1814}} the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]] (1814&ndash;1848)\n*{{flagicon|Hannover}} the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814\u20131866)\n*{{flagicon|Poland|variant=1815}} the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (1815&ndash;1867/[[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|1918]])\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] (1830 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Germany|variant=empire}} the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Greece|variant=old}} the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (1832&ndash;1973)\n*{{flagicon|Italy|variant=1861}} the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861&ndash;1946)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1882\u20131947)\n*{{flagicon|Russia|variant=empire}} the [[Russian Empire]] (1721\u20131917)\n*{{flagicon|Serbia|variant=1882}} the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (1882\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] (1908\u20131946)\nMany countries [[Abolished monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] in the 20th century and became republics, especially in the wake of either [[World War I]] or [[World War II]].\n\nMonarchies established during the [[interbellum period]] were:\n*{{flagicon|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1918&ndash;1945)\n*{{flagicon|Hungary|variant=1920}} the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (1920\u20131946)\n*{{flagicon|Albania}} the [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Kingdom of Albania]] (1928\u20131944)\n\n=== Territorial evolution ===\n{|style=\"float:center; clear:left; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1714 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1789 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1799 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1815 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>1714: after [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spain's Succession]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>1789: French Revolution's eve</small>\n|align=left|<small>1799: near the Revolution's end<br /></small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1815|European states in 1815]]</small>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1914 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1930 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1950 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 2015 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1914|European states in 1914]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1930|European states in 1930]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1950|European states in 1950]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 2015|European states in 2015]]</small>\n|}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Monarchies}}\n{{Legend|#0000FF|Republics}}\n{{Legend|#008000|Ecclesiastical lands}}\n{{Legend|#9932CC|[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]}}\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===Table of monarchies in Europe===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! style=\"width:15%\" | State !!

This comparison may be hard to draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding the [[private property]] of the monarch. In the UK, the [[Crown Estate]] has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]]) by every monarch since the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1&nbsp;million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the [[Finances of the British royal family|expenses of the British royal family]] in this sense resulting in a \"negative cost\" of the British monarchy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' published an overview of the annual expenditure (excluding security expenses) of all European royal houses (not counting [[Luxembourg]] and the four monarchical [[European microstates]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

His four main conclusions were:\n* The personal salaries of presidents are lower than those of monarchs;<ref name=\"Matthijs\"/>\n* The transparency differs between republics and monarchies, and is formally regulated in republics;\n* In republics, pension costs of former heads of state are higher, although the figures don't say so;\n* The existence of subsidies to family members of the heads of state in some monarchies increases their expenses. \nHe stressed that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can know exactly what they pay for, may be unfair. In a 2015 interview with ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', Matthijs commented that the then-known \u20ac7.7&nbsp;million allotted to the royal house in Spain's national budget was 'unbelievable': \"I can't find out more, but I understand from the media that the total expenses of the Spanish house may be as much as 80 million.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/10/16/nederland-heeft-in-europa-het-duurste-vorstenhuis-1546931-a1266057 |title=Nederland heeft in Europa het duurste vorstenhuis |author= Philip de Witt Wijnen |work=NRC Handelsblad |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in France was [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished]], and in all territories the [[French First Republic]] conquered during the following [[Coalition Wars]], [[sister republic]]s were proclaimed. However, after [[Napoleon]] crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic [[Concert of Europe|European Restoration]] reaffirmed the monarchical balance of power on the continent.\n\nIn subsequent decades, republicanism would regain lost ground with the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The [[Revolutions of 1848]] were largely inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, and the remaining monarchies were transformed into [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]].\n\nRepublican movements in Europe remain active up to present. The most prominent organisations campaigning to eliminate one or more of Europe's remaining monarchies and/or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families are affiliated with the [[Alliance of European Republican Movements]], but there are smaller independent initiatives as well, such as Hetis2013 in the Netherlands.<ref>[http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ Hetis2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227161052/http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ |date=27 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0429/As-Dutch-prepare-for-new-king-republicans-ask-to-abolish-monarchy-video|title=As Dutch prepare for new king, republicans ask to abolish monarchy|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> Also, some political parties (e.g. [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain) have stepped up and called for national [[referendum|referenda]] to abolish monarchies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/spain-majority-referendum-monarchy|title=Majority in Spain want referendum on future of monarchy|first=Agence France-Presse in|last=Madrid|date=8 June 2014|website=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/06/anti-monarchy-protests-persist-spain-20146722541807612.html|title=Anti-monarchy protests persist in Spain|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Calls for restoration===\n{{further|List of current pretenders#Europe|International Monarchist League}}\nThe political influence of [[monarchism]] in former European monarchies is very limited.\n\nThere are several monarchist parties in France, most notably the ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (established 1899).\nMonarchist parties also exist [[Koruna \u010cesk\u00e1 (party)|in the Czech Republic]] (1991), [[National Hope|in Greece]] (2010), [[Monarchist Alliance|in Italy]] (1972) and [[Monarchist Party|in Russia]] (2012).\n\n[[Otto von Habsburg]] renounced all pretense to the Habsburg titles in 1958, and monarchism in Austria has next to no political influence; a German monarchist organisation called ''[[Tradition und Leben]]'' has been in existence since 1959.\n[[Monarchism in Bavaria after 1918|Monarchism in Bavaria]] has had more significant support, including [[Franz Josef Strauss]], minister-president of Bavaria from 1978&ndash;1988.\n\n[[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]] is a proponent of re-creating a [[constitutional monarchy]] in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king.

There remain, as of 2016, twelve (12) sovereign '''monarchies in Europe'''. Seven are [[Realm|kingdoms]]: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Monaco]] are [[Principality|principalities]], while Luxembourg is a [[Grand duchy|Grand Duchy]]. The [[Vatican City]] is a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] state ruled by the [[Pope]].\n\nThe monarchies can be divided into two broad classes: pre-modern states and those that gained their independence during or immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden the UK, Spain, and Andorra are the sucessors to pre-modern monarchies. Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were established or gained independence through various methods during the Napoleonic Wars. The [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]] was recognized as a sovereign state administered by the [[Holy See]] in 1929. \n\nTen of these monarchies are [[Hereditary title|hereditary]], and two are elective: Vatican City (the Pope, elected at the [[papal conclave]]), and [[Andorra]] (technically a semi-elective diarchy, the joint heads of state being the elected [[President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]], appointed by the Pope).\n\nMost of the monarchies in Europe are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. The exceptions are [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]], which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and Vatican City, which is a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]]. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see [[monarchism]] and [[republicanism]]) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] in the United Kingdom). Currently six of the twelve monarchies are members of the [[European Union]]: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and [[San Marino]] were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of [[republicanism]] to the political [[mainstream]] started only at the beginning of the 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the [[Sovereign state|states]] in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected [[head of state]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|Map of [[Mycenaean Greece]].]]\nThe notion of kingship in Europe ultimately originates in systems of [[tribal kingship]] in [[prehistoric Europe]]. The [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 1400 BCE) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in [[protohistory|protohistoric]] Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the [[Linear B]] script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about society in the Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of [[palace economy|palace economies]].<ref name=\"Blois71\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 71\u201372.</ref> The role of kings changed in the following [[Greek Dark Ages]] (c. 1100 \u2013 c. 750 BCE) to big [[gentleman farmer]]s with military power.<ref name=\"Blois71\"/>\n\n=== Archaic and classical antiquity ===\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|left|thumb|The [[Pnyx]], as [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|meeting place]] the heart of [[Athenian democracy]].]]\nSince the beginning of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was in the hands of a number of people that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (c. 750\u2013500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek [[Polis|poleis]],<ref name=\"Blois74\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 74.</ref> and [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|also in Rome]] (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility ([[aristocracy]]), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations ([[tyranny]], 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy ([[oligarchy]]) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in [[Classical Greece]] (mainly after 500 BCE).<ref name=\"Blois86\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 86\u201387.</ref> [[Athenian democracy]] (6th century\u2013322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; [[Sparta|classical Sparta]] (c. 550\u2013371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy ([[List of kings of Sparta|dual kingship]]), aristocracy ([[Gerousia]]) and democracy ([[Apella]]);<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"geronten\".</ref> the [[Roman Republic]] (c. 509\u201327 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Romeinse Rijk. \u00a72.

In 168, Macedon was [[Macedonian Wars|subdued by the Romans]], and partitioned into four client republics. These were annexed as Roman provinces in 148, as happened to Greece in 146,<ref name=\"Blois127\"/> making Rome's territory envelop all of literate Europe. The remainder of Iberia, the Illyrian coast and eventually [[Gaul]] by general [[Julius Caesar]] were added to the Roman Republic, which however was experiencing an institutional crisis. After defeating his rival [[Pompey]], Caesar was appointed ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' to restore order.

Most of the [[barbarian kingdoms]] established in the 5th century \n(the kingdoms of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi]], [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundi]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[kingdom of the Franks|Franks]], [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]]) recognised the Roman Emperor at least nominally, and Germanic kingdoms would continue to mint coins depicting the Roman emperor well into the 6th century.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'' (1937), 46&ndash;48.</ref>\nIt was this derivation of the authority of kingship from the Christian Roman Empire that would be at the core of the medieval institution of kingship in Europe and its notion of the [[divine right of kings]], as well as the position of the Pope in [[Latin Christendom]], the restoration of the Roman Empire under [[Charlemagne]] and the derived concept of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western and Central Europe.\n\n===Medieval Europe===\nThe monarchies of Europe in the Christian [[Middle Ages]] derived their claim from [[Christianisation]] and the [[divine right of kings]], partly influenced by the notion of [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]] inherited from [[Germanic antiquity]].\nThe [[great power]]s of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]] were the result of a gradual process of centralization of power taking place over the course of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe [[Early Middle Ages]] begin with a fragmentation of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] into \"[[barbarian kingdoms]]\". In Western Europe, the kingdom of the [[Franks]] developed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] by the 8th century, and the [[Heptarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] were unified into the [[kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. \nWith the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of [[feudalism]] places kings at the head of a pyramid of relationships between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of [[baron]]s, and the intermediate positions of [[counts]] (or [[earl]]s) and [[duke]]s. The core of European feudal [[manorialism]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] were the territories of the [[kingdom of France]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (centered on the nominal kingdoms of [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]) and the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].\n\n===Early Modern Europe===\n\n[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|European dominions of the House of Habsburg in 1700]]\nWith the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]], the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of [[James I of England]] (1603\u20131625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567\u20131625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\n[[Early modern Europe]] was dominated by the [[Wars of Religion]], notably the [[Thirty Years' War]], during which the major European monarchies developed into centralised [[great power]]s sustained by their [[colonial empire]]s.\nThe main European powers in the early modern period were:\n*the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] with its [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]]\n*the [[Portuguese Empire]] of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Iberian Union|personal union with Spain]] 1580&ndash;1640)\n*the [[Spanish Empire]] of [[Habsburg Spain]] (after 1700 [[Bourbon Spain]])\n*the [[British Empire]] of the English and Scottish [[Union of the Crowns]] (after 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]])\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was increasingly dominated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and by [[Prussia]]\n*the [[Tsardom of Russia]]\n*the kingdom of Poland as the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n*the kingdom of Sweden rose to the status of great power as the comparatively short-lived [[Swedish Empire]] due to the Thirty Years' War \n*the kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]]\n\nThe [[House of Habsburg]] became the most influential royal dynasty in continental Europe by the 17th century, divided into the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] branches.\n\n===Modern Europe===\n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|Map of Europe in 1815]]\nThe modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649, followed by the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u201383) and especially the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399). The absolutist [[Kingdom of France]] was first transformed to a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy (1791\u201392)]], before being [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fully abolished]] on 21 September 1792, and eventually the [[Execution of Louis XVI|former king even executed]], to the other European courts' great shock. During the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131799), the great European monarchies were unable to restore the monarchy; instead, the [[French First Republic]] expanded and annexed neighbouring territories, or converted them into loyal [[sister republic]]s. Meanwhile, the [[German Mediatization]] of 1803 thoroughly rearranged the political structure of the Holy Roman Empire, with many small principalities and all ecclesiastical lands being annexed by larger monarchies. After [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|Napoleon seized power]], however, he gradually constructed a new imperial order in French-controlled Europe, first by [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning himself Emperor of the French]] in 1804, and then converting the sister republics into monarchies ruled by his relatives.\n\nFollowing Napoleon's defeat in 1814 and 1815, the reactionary [[Congress of Vienna]] determined that all of Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon dynasty was restored]], replaced by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The popular [[Napoleon III]] was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the [[Second French Empire]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|\"Two Sicilies\"]]) were absorbed into the [[kingdom of Sardinia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with [[Austro-Prussian War|Prussia emerging victorious]] in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, [[Franco-Prussian War|defeat France]] and absorb the southern German states into the [[German Empire]] in the process (1870\u201371). From the ashes of the Second Empire rose the [[French Third Republic]], the only great republican European power until World War I.\n\nMuch of 19th century politics was characterised by the division between [[republicanism|anti-monarchist]] [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] [[conservatism]]. \nThe Kingdom of Spain was [[First Spanish Republic|briefly abolished]] in 1873, [[Restoration (Spain)|restored]] 1874&ndash;1931 and again [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|in 1978]].\nThe [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was abolished in 1910. The [[Russian Empire]] ended in 1917, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1918.\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] fell [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|under Habsburg rule]] in 1867 and was dissolved in 1918 ([[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|restored]] 1920\u20131946). Likewise, the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] under Habsburg rule was dissolved in 1918.\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] transformed the political landscape of Europe, and a number of modern kingdoms were formed in a resurgence of monarchism after the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]:\n\n*{{flagicon|Austria|variant=empire}} the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] (1804\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|W\u00fcrttemberg}} the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Bavaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1805 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Saxony}} the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (1806&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1816).svg}} the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] (1808\u20131861)\n*{{flagicon|France|variant=1814}} the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]] (1814&ndash;1848)\n*{{flagicon|Hannover}} the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814\u20131866)\n*{{flagicon|Poland|variant=1815}} the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (1815&ndash;1867/[[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|1918]])\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] (1830 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Germany|variant=empire}} the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Greece|variant=old}} the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (1832&ndash;1973)\n*{{flagicon|Italy|variant=1861}} the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861&ndash;1946)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1882\u20131947)\n*{{flagicon|Russia|variant=empire}} the [[Russian Empire]] (1721\u20131917)\n*{{flagicon|Serbia|variant=1882}} the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (1882\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] (1908\u20131946)\nMany countries [[Abolished monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] in the 20th century and became republics, especially in the wake of either [[World War I]] or [[World War II]].\n\nMonarchies established during the [[interbellum period]] were:\n*{{flagicon|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1918&ndash;1945)\n*{{flagicon|Hungary|variant=1920}} the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (1920\u20131946)\n*{{flagicon|Albania}} the [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Kingdom of Albania]] (1928\u20131944)\n\n=== Territorial evolution ===\n{|style=\"float:center; clear:left; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1714 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1789 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1799 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1815 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>1714: after [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spain's Succession]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>1789: French Revolution's eve</small>\n|align=left|<small>1799: near the Revolution's end<br /></small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1815|European states in 1815]]</small>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1914 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1930 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1950 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 2015 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1914|European states in 1914]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1930|European states in 1930]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1950|European states in 1950]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 2015|European states in 2015]]</small>\n|}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Monarchies}}\n{{Legend|#0000FF|Republics}}\n{{Legend|#008000|Ecclesiastical lands}}\n{{Legend|#9932CC|[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]}}\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===Table of monarchies in Europe===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! style=\"width:15%\" | State !!

In 1566, the [[stadtholder]] [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] became the main leader of the [[Dutch revolt]] against the [[Spanish Habsburgs]] that set off the [[Eighty Years' War]] and resulted in the formal independence of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in 1581. He was born in the [[House of Nassau]] as [[Nassau (state)|Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]]. He became [[Prince of Orange]] in 1544 and is thereby the founder of the branch [[House of Orange-Nassau]]\n\nHis descendants became de facto [[head of state|heads of state]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] during the 16th to 18th centuries, which was an effectively hereditary role. For the last half century of its existence, it became an officially hereditary role and thus a monarchy (though maintaining republican pretense) under [[William IV, Prince of Orange|Prince William IV]]. His son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|Prince William V]], was the last ''stadtholder'' of the republic, whose own son, [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]], became the first king of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which was established on 16 March 1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. With the independence of Belgium on 21 July 1831, the Netherlands formally became the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

This comparison may be hard to draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding the [[private property]] of the monarch. In the UK, the [[Crown Estate]] has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]]) by every monarch since the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1&nbsp;million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the [[Finances of the British royal family|expenses of the British royal family]] in this sense resulting in a \"negative cost\" of the British monarchy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' published an overview of the annual expenditure (excluding security expenses) of all European royal houses (not counting [[Luxembourg]] and the four monarchical [[European microstates]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

His four main conclusions were:\n* The personal salaries of presidents are lower than those of monarchs;<ref name=\"Matthijs\"/>\n* The transparency differs between republics and monarchies, and is formally regulated in republics;\n* In republics, pension costs of former heads of state are higher, although the figures don't say so;\n* The existence of subsidies to family members of the heads of state in some monarchies increases their expenses. \nHe stressed that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can know exactly what they pay for, may be unfair.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in France was [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished]], and in all territories the [[French First Republic]] conquered during the following [[Coalition Wars]], [[sister republic]]s were proclaimed. However, after [[Napoleon]] crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic [[Concert of Europe|European Restoration]] reaffirmed the monarchical balance of power on the continent.\n\nIn subsequent decades, republicanism would regain lost ground with the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The [[Revolutions of 1848]] were largely inspired by republicanism.

Meanwhile, Susan Murphy of [[Modesto, California]] is going to be married to news weatherman, Derek Dietl. Just before the ceremony, she is hit by the meteorite and its energy causes her to glow green and grow to an enormous size with her hair turning white during the wedding. A U.S. military detachment tranquilizes and captures her. She awakens in a top secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant. She meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility, and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach PhD, a [[mad scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless, living mass of blue goo as a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive bug mutated by nuclear radiation standing 350 feet in height, and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000 year old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan, herself renamed to \"Ginormica\", is forbidden any contact with her friends and family, leaving her feeling increasingly isolated.\n\nOn a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make first contact with it. However, the attempt fails and the probe goes on a destructive rampage, headed straight for [[San Francisco]]. Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium radiating through Susan's body and tries to take it from her, putting many lives at risk. At the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the monsters work together and manage to defeat the probe.\n\nGallaxhar sets course for Earth to obtain the quantonium in person while the now-free Susan returns home with her new friends and reunites with her family. However, the monsters alienate themselves from the humans due to their inexperience with social situations. Derek breaks off his engagement with Susan, claiming that he cannot marry someone who would overshadow him and his career. Heartbroken, the monsters reunite, but Susan finally realizes that her life is better as a monster and promises not to sell herself ''short'' to anyone again. Suddenly, Susan is pulled into Gallaxhar's spaceship. Insectosaurus tries to save her, but he is shot down by the ship's plasma cannons, seemingly killing him.\n\nOn board the ship, Susan breaks free from her prison cell and furiously chases down Gallaxhar, but is trapped by a machine that extracts the quantonium from her body, shrinking her back to her normal size. Gallaxhar then uses the extracted quantonium to create [[cloning|clones]] of himself in order to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth. Monger manages to get the monsters on board the ship. They rescue Susan and make their way to the main power core where Dr. Cockroach sets the ship to self-destruct to prevent the invasion. All but Susan are trapped as the blast doors close and she personally confronts Gallaxhar on the bridge. With time running out, she sends the ball of stored quantonium down on herself, restoring her monstrous size and strength. After rescuing her friends, they flee the ship and meet with Monger and Insectosaurus, who has morphed into a giant butterfly. The ship self-destructs, killing Gallaxhar and his army.\n\nReturning to Modesto, Susan and the monsters receive a hero's welcome. Hoping to take advantage of Susan's fame for his own career, Derek tries to get back together with her, but she rejects him. Monger then arrives to tell the monsters about a new monstrous [[snail]] called \"Escargantua\" slowly making its way to [[Paris]], and the film ends with the monsters taking off to confront the new menace.\n<!-- Do not add any reference to the post credits scene. -->\n\n==Voice cast==\n===Monsters===\n<!-- DO NOT add unsourced material and speculation (such as \"apparently\", \"evidently\", \"probably\", etc).

Meanwhile, Susan Murphy of [[Modesto, California]] is going to be married to news weatherman, Derek Dietl. Just before the ceremony, she is hit by the meteorite and its energy causes her to glow green and grow to an enormous size with her hair turning white during the wedding. A U.S. military detachment tranquilizes and captures her. She awakens in a top secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant. She meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility, and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach PhD, a [[mad scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless, living mass of blue goo as a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive bug mutated by nuclear radiation standing 350 feet in height, and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000 year old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan, herself renamed to \"Ginormica\", is forbidden any contact with her friends and family, leaving her feeling increasingly isolated.\n\nOn a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make first contact with it. However, the attempt fails and the probe goes on a destructive rampage, headed straight for [[San Francisco]]. Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium radiating through Susan's body and tries to take it from her, putting many lives at risk. At the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the monsters work together and manage to defeat the probe.\n\nGallaxhar sets course for Earth to obtain the quantonium in person while the now-free Susan returns home with her new friends and reunites with her family. However, the monsters alienate themselves from the humans due to their inexperience with social situations. Derek breaks off his engagement with Susan, claiming that he cannot marry someone who would overshadow him and his career. Heartbroken, the monsters reunite, but Susan finally realizes that her life is better as a monster and promises not to sell herself ''short'' to anyone again. Suddenly, Susan is pulled into Gallaxhar's spaceship. Insectosaurus tries to save her, but he is shot down by the ship's plasma cannons, seemingly killing him.\n\nOn board the ship, Susan breaks free from her prison cell and furiously chases down Gallaxhar, but is trapped by a machine that extracts the quantonium from her body, shrinking her back to her normal size. Gallaxhar then uses the extracted quantonium to create [[cloning|clones]] of himself in order to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth. Monger manages to get the monsters on board the ship. They rescue Susan and make their way to the main power core where Dr. Cockroach sets the ship to self-destruct to prevent the invasion. All but Susan are trapped as the blast doors close and she personally confronts Gallaxhar on the bridge. With time running out, she sends the ball of stored quantonium down on herself, restoring her monstrous size and strength. After rescuing her friends, they flee the ship and meet with Monger and Insectosaurus, who has morphed into a giant butterfly. The ship self-destructs, killing Gallaxhar and his army.\n\nReturning to Modesto, Susan and the monsters receive a hero's welcome. Hoping to take advantage of Susan's fame for his own career, Derek tries to get back together with her, but she rejects him. Monger then arrives to tell the monsters about a new monstrous [[snail]] called \"Escargantua\" slowly making its way to [[Paris]], and the film ends with the monsters taking off to confront the new menace.\n<!-- Do not add any reference to the post credits scene. -->\n\n==Voice cast==\n===Monsters===\n<!-- DO NOT add unsourced material and speculation (such as \"apparently\", \"evidently\", \"probably\", etc).

{"title_page": "George Washington and slavery", "text_new": "[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb|right|''George Washington'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1780), with [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], Washington's enslaved personal servant|alt=painting]]\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\nIt is the paradox of '''George Washington and slavery''' that the man who successfully fought a war in the name of liberty owned slaves his entire adult life.  He became uneasy with [[Slavery in the colonial United States|an institution]] that was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|his native Virginia]], and ultimately provided for the emancipation of his slaves in his will. \n\n[[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery surfaced in the 1760s, when the transition from tobacco to grain crops at his Mount Vernon estate left him with a surplus of slaves, prompting him to question the economic viability of slavery. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept blacks, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and blacks in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 blacks, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref>Twohig 2003 p. 117</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt Mansion House Farm, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them [[Joel Chandler Harris]]'s tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with their charges.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry.

The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot.

It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read.

The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that presaged Washington's emancipation of his slaves in his will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He presided over an administration that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support in French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between the antislavery North and proslavery South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery. His abolitionist aspirations for the nation were confined to the hope that slavery would disappear naturally over time with the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibition of slave imports]] in 1808, the earliest date such legislation could be passed as agreed at the Constitutional Convention.<ref name=Twohig131 /><ref>Morgan 2000 p. 296</ref>\n\n====As Virginia farmer====\nIn addition to political caution, economic imperatives remained an important consideration with regard to Washington's personal position as a slaveholder and his efforts to free himself from his dependency on slavery.<ref name=Twohig128>Twohig 2001 p. 128</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p423>Morgan 2005 p. 423</ref> He was one of the largest debtors in Virginia at the end of the war,<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 92</ref> and by 1787 the business at Mount Vernon had failed to make a profit for more than a decade.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married. [[Martha Parke Custis Peter|Young Martha]] brought sixty-one slaves to her marriage with Thomas Peter in 1795, [[Elizabeth Parke Custis Law|Eliza]] married [[Thomas Law (1756\u20131834)|Thomas Law]] the next year and [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Nelly]] was wed to [[Lawrence Lewis (1767\u20131839)|Lawrence Lewis]] in 1799. Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become a Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\", though in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt.

By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free black settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821.

In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves.

He became uneasy with [[Slavery in the colonial United States|an institution]] that was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|his native Virginia]], and ultimately provided for the emancipation of his slaves in his will. \n\n[[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery surfaced in the 1760s, when the transition from tobacco to grain crops at his Mount Vernon estate left him with a surplus of slaves, prompting him to question the economic viability of slavery. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept blacks, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and blacks in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 blacks, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them [[Joel Chandler Harris]]'s tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with their charges.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against Martha.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

And that was the psycholgical violence of slavery.

Rewards in the form of better blankets and clothing fabric were given to the \"most deserving\", and there are examples of cash payments being awarded for good behavior.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 259\u2013260</ref> He opposed the use of the lash in principle, but saw the practice as a necessary evil and sanctioned its occasional use, generally as a last resort, on both male and female slaves if they did not, in his words, \"do their duty by fair means.\"<ref name=Hirschfeld36 /> There are accounts of carpenters being whipped in 1758 when the overseer \"could see a fault\", of a slave called Jemmy being whipped for stealing corn and escaping in 1773 and of a seamstress called Charlotte being whipped in 1793 by an overseer \"determined to lower Spirit or skin her Back\" for impudence and refusing to work.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 125</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 248, 432 n6 & n7</ref>\n\nWashington regarded the \"passion\" with which one of his overseers administered floggings to be counter-productive, and Charlotte's protest that she had not been whipped in fourteen years indicates the frequency with which physical punishment was used.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref><ref>MVLA Resistance & Punishment</ref> Whippings were administered by overseers after review, a system Washington required to ensure slaves were spared capricious and extreme punishment.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in agreeing the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming blacks or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free blacks when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit. During a period of severe wartime depreciation, the question was not whether to sell his slaves, but when, where and how best to sell them.

Six of them had been collated into an expensively bound volume titled ''Tracts on Slavery'', indicating that he attached some importance to that selection. Five of the six were published in or after 1788.{{efn|''Tracts on Slavery'' was one volume in a set of thirty-six that Washington had bound probably sometime after 1795. The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in antislavery movements in France and Great Britain. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to sacrifice abolition on the altar of national unity under a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that presaged Washington's emancipation of his slaves in his will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between the antislavery North and proslavery South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt. Vernon.jpg|thumb|right|Slave burial ground memorial at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAny hopes Washington may have had that his example and prestige would influence the thinking of others, including his own family, proved to be unfounded. His action was ignored by southern slaveholders, and slavery continued at Mount Vernon.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 359</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 216\u2013217</ref> Already from 1795, dower slaves were being transferred to Martha's three granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 341</ref> Martha felt threatened by the fact that she was surrounded with slaves whose freedom depended on her death and freed her late husband's slaves on January 1, 1801.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 311</ref>{{efn|There is a suggestion that slaves were implicated in starting a fire at the main residence after Washington's death, and there were rumors that Martha was in danger, including one that slaves planned to poison her. Other factors that may have influenced her decision to free Washington's slaves early include concerns about the expense of maintaining slaves that were not necessary to operate the estate and about discontent among the dower slaves if they continued to mix with slaves who were to be freed.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 29\u201333</ref>}}\n\nThe able-bodied slaves were cut loose and left to support themselves and their families.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 34\u201335</ref> Within a few months, almost all of Washington's former slaves had left Mount Vernon, leaving 121 adult and working-age children still working the estate. Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free black settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the gazette when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved. When asked, having experienced the hardships of being a freewoman and having outlived both husband and children, whether she regretted her escape, she replied, \"No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by [that] means.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nWashington's will was both private testament and public statement on the institution.<ref name=Morgan2005p404>Morgan 2005 p. 404</ref><ref name=Morgan2000p298>Morgan 2000 p. 298</ref> It was published widely{{snd}}in newspapers nationwide, as a pamphlet which, in 1800 alone, extended to thirteen separate editions, and included in other works{{snd}}and became part of the nationalist narrative.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201385</ref> In the eulogies of the antislavery faction, the inconvenient fact of Washington's slaveholding was downplayed in favor of his final act of emancipation. Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=E-Book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

{"title_page": "History of Fairbanks, Alaska", "text_new": "{{Alaska History}}\nThe history of '''[[Fairbanks]]''', the second-largest city in [[Alaska]], can be traced to the founding of a trading post by [[E.T. Barnette]] on the south bank of the [[Chena River]] on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe discovery of gold near Barnette's trading post caused him to turn what had been a temporary stop into a permanent one. The gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks. Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]].\n\nBy the time of [[World War I]], the easy-to-reach gold was exhausted and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at [[Ruby, Alaska|Ruby]] and [[Iditarod, Alaska|Iditarod]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous [[gold dredge]]s were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s as the price of gold rose during the [[Great Depression]]. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during [[World War II]] and the first decade of the [[Cold War]].\n\nIn 1968, the vast [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] was discovered in [[Alaska North Slope|Alaska's North Slope]]. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], which caused a boom unseen since the first years of Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating [[1967 Fairbanks Flood]]. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]], which took Fairbanks as its [[County seat|borough seat]]. A [[1980s oil glut|drop in oil prices during the 1980s]] caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.\n\n==Before Fairbanks==\n[[File:Fairbanks,Alaska First Settlers.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to the first settlers of Fairbanks.]]\nThough there was never a permanent [[Alaska Native]] settlement at the site of Fairbanks, [[Prehistory of Alaska#Athabascan Indians|Athabascan Indians]] have used the area for thousands of years.

Vol. 16, No. 4 (Fall 1969). p. 335</ref> In 1885, [[Henry Tureman Allen]] of the U.S. Army led the first recorded expedition down the length of the Tanana River, charting the Chena River's mouth along the way.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. vii</ref>\n\nIn July 1897, the first news of the Klondike gold strike reached Seattle, Washington, triggering the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 1</ref> Thousands of people boarded steamships heading north to the gold fields. Some of these travelers sailed around the western tip of Alaska and up the Yukon River to [[Dawson City]] (site of the gold fields) rather than take an arduous overland trip across the [[Boundary Ranges]].<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 5</ref>\n\nOne of these adventurers was E.T. Barnette, who intended to establish a trading post at [[Tanacross, Alaska]], where the [[Valdez-Eagle Trail]] crossed the Tanana River.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 18&ndash;19</ref> He hired the steamer ''Lavelle Young'' to transport him and his supplies, and they began their trip upriver in August 1901.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 21</ref> After turning into the Tanana from the Yukon, the steamboat ran into low water. After venturing upstream several miles, the boat reached an impassable point. Barnette suggested the Chena River (then called the Rock River) might be a [[River delta|slough]] of the Tanana and a way around the low water.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the mouth of the Chena, the ''Lavelle Young'' again ran into an impassable stretch of river. The captain of the Young did not want to travel downstream with a heavy load because of the danger posed by the extra mass. He therefore unloaded Barnette's cargo on August 26, 1901, with an irate Barnette assisting.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 24</ref>\n\nBarnette began building a cabin at a site he named \"Chenoa City\", and he sold supplies to two [[Prospecting|prospectors]], [[Felix Pedro]] and Tom Gilmore, who were in the area.<ref name=\"Crooked Past, p. 25\">''Crooked Past'', p. 25</ref> Barnette traded for furs, then traveled to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] via [[sled dog|dog team]] with his wife and three other men. The mountain pass they traveled through was later named [[Isabel Pass]] in honor of Barnette's wife.<ref name=\"Crooked Past, p. 25\"/> From Valdez, he returned to St. Michael, where he built a steamboat, the ''Isabelle'', and began sailing up the Yukon in August 1902.<ref name=\"Crooked34\">''Crooked Past'', p. 34</ref> He intended to move his supplies to Tanacross, but when he arrived at his trading post on the Chena River, he changed his mind. Felix Pedro had [[Discovery Claim on Pedro Creek|discovered gold]].<ref name=\"Crooked34\"/>\n\n==Origins of Fairbanks==\nBefore Barnette traveled upriver with the ''Isabelle'', he met Judge [[James Wickersham]] in St. Michael. Wickersham was the judge for the federal Third Judicial District, which stretched from the North Slope to the [[Aleutian Islands]].<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 29</ref> Wickersham was impressed with Barnette and his plan to establish a trading post at Tanacross. He suggested Barnette name his settlement Fairbanks, after [[Charles W. Fairbanks]], the senior [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Indiana]].<ref>https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/charles_fairbanks.pdf</ref> Barnette liked the idea and later said, \"If we should ever want aid at the national capital, we would have the friendship, at least, of someone who could help us.\"<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 32</ref> When Barnette heard of Pedro's gold strike, he transferred the name for his planned Tanacross store to the settlement on the Chena River and convinced the people with him to accept the name.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 38&ndash;39</ref>\n\nWhen Barnette and the ''Isabelle'''s crew heard of Pedro's discovery, they immediately fled the boat and the settlement to stake claims on creeks and likely gold-bearing spots {{convert|12|mi|km}} north, near the mountain and creek Pedro named after himself.<ref name=\"Crooked38\">''Crooked Past'', p. 38</ref> Marking a claim was simple. Each man could pick a set amount of space, which was marked with posts at each corner, hence \"staking\" the claim.<ref>De Windt, Harry. [https://books.google.com/books?id=79DMMjRBtscC&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Through the Gold Fields of Alaska to Bering Straits'']. Chatto & Windus, 1898. pp. 294&ndash;296</ref> Each claim had to be listed by a federal recorder. When Barnette and the crew of the ''Isabelle'' were staking claims, Barnette proclaimed himself the interim recorder until an official one could be brought to the area. Although they also recorded their claims with Barnette, most men also reported their claims at the official office in Circle.<ref name=\"Crooked38\"/> To maximize his gain, Barnette had [[power of attorney]] for several relatives in [[Ohio]]. He staked claims in their names, thus giving him authority over a large portion of what was believed to be the gold-bearing terrain.<ref name=\"Crooked38\"/>\n\nWord of Pedro's discovery spread during the months that followed Barnette's arrival in September 1902. In December, he wrote to a friend in Seattle, \"A message came yesterday that 1,000 people had left [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] during the last three days for here. I look for half of Dawson here before spring.\"<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 40</ref> In January 1903, Barnette's cook, [[Jujiro Wada]], arrived in Dawson City with word of the gold find. On January 17, 1903, the ''Yukon Sun'' newspaper ran the headline \"RICH STRIKE MADE IN THE TANANA\" across most of its front page, spurring miners from the Yukon to stampede to Fairbanks in the first big rush of the settlement's history.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 42</ref>\n\n==Boom==\nWhen the miners from Nome, Dawson, [[Rampart, Alaska|Rampart]], and other places arrived in the Tanana Valley, they were disappointed with what they found. Hundreds of claims were staked, but none were close to Pedro's discovery claims, which had been taken by the crew of the ''Isabelle'' and other early arrivers.<ref name=\"Crooked51\">''Crooked Past'', p. 51</ref> Adding to the pressure on claiming land were men who, like Barnette, had power of attorney rights for others, and could thus make multiple claims. The ''Dawson Daily News'' reported that one man claimed 144 portions of {{convert|20|acre|m2}} apiece.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 52</ref> Around Barnette's trading post, town lots were claimed for $2.50 apiece, and there was fierce competition for the choicest spots.<ref name=\"Crooked50\">''Crooked Past'', p. 50</ref> At the mouth of the Chena River, a competing settlement, named Chena, sprang up when two traders moved their store to the junction of the two rivers. Land [[speculation]] was fierce in Chena, where claims were frequently stolen and had to be enforced with firearms.<ref name=\"Crooked50\"/>\n\nAccounts vary, but historians estimate that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men arrived in the Tanana Valley.<ref name=\"Crooked51\"/> This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 54</ref> Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April, Judge Wickersham arrived on a trip looking for a location for the courthouse, jail, and government offices for the Third District courts. He later described his first view of the settlement: \"A half-dozen new squat log structures, a few tents ... a small clearing in the primitive forest\u2014that was Fairbanks as I first saw it on April 9, 1903.\"<ref>Wickersham, p. 182</ref> Wickersham examined Chena as a potential site for the government offices, but he settled on Fairbanks, partially because Barnette's partner and brother-in-law, Frank Cleary, gave Wickersham a choice piece of land valued at between $1,500 and $2,000.<ref name=\"Crooked58\">''Crooked Past'', p. 58</ref> Wickersham asked Cleary to name the two main streets in town Cushman and Lacey, after [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] [[Francis W.

Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling for as little as $10.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 60</ref> Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged for the establishment of a post office at his settlement.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 62</ref>\n\nIn fall 1903, the flood of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks.

The Northern Commercial Company built a store to replace Barnette's cabin, and Wickersham recorded a wide range of businesses, including 500 houses and 1,200 people.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 73</ref> To manage the growing population, the settlement held a vote on November 10, 1903 to decide whether to [[Municipal corporation|incorporate]] Fairbanks as a town or not.

[[Alyeska Pipeline Service Company]] alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright.<ref name=\"Gold203\">''Gold Rush Town'', p. 203</ref> Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.<ref name=\"Gold203\"/>\n\nThis increase in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, ran out of phone numbers and the waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries.<ref>''Gold Rush Town'', p. 202</ref> Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent [[Brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s.<ref name=\"Gold203\"/> Home prices skyrocketed\u2014a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 164</ref> Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 168</ref> One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 167</ref>\n\nThe skyrocketing prices were driven by the high salaries paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', pp. 118&ndash;126</ref> The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could not keep up with the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', pp. 127&ndash;128</ref> Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', pp. 129&ndash;130</ref> More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services.

Barnette]] on the south bank of the [[Chena River]] on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe discovery of gold near Barnette's trading post caused him to turn what had been a temporary stop into a permanent one. The gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks. Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]].\n\nBy the time of [[World War I]], the easy-to-reach gold was exhausted and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at [[Ruby, Alaska|Ruby]] and [[Iditarod, Alaska|Iditarod]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous [[gold dredge]]s were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s as the price of gold rose during the [[Great Depression]]. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during [[World War II]] and the first decade of the [[Cold War]].\n\nIn 1968, the vast [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] was discovered in [[Alaska North Slope|Alaska's North Slope]]. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], which caused a boom unseen since the first years of Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating [[1967 Fairbanks Flood]]. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]], which took Fairbanks as its [[County seat|borough seat]]. A [[1980s oil glut|drop in oil prices during the 1980s]] caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.\n\n==Before Fairbanks==\n[[File:Fairbanks,Alaska First Settlers.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to the first settlers of Fairbanks.]]\nThough there was never a permanent [[Alaska Native]] settlement at the site of Fairbanks, [[Prehistory of Alaska#Athabascan Indians|Athabascan Indians]] have used the area for thousands of years.

Barnette, who intended to establish a trading post at [[Tanacross, Alaska]], where the [[Valdez-Eagle Trail]] crossed the Tanana River.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 18&ndash;19</ref> He hired the steamer ''Lavelle Young'' to transport him and his supplies, and they began their trip upriver in August 1901.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 21</ref> After turning into the Tanana from the Yukon, the steamboat ran into low water. After venturing upstream several miles, the boat reached an impassable point. Barnette suggested the Chena River (then called the Rock River) might be a [[River delta|slough]] of the Tanana and a way around the low water.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the mouth of the Chena, the ''Lavelle Young'' again ran into an impassable stretch of river. The captain of the Young did not want to travel downstream with a heavy load because of the danger posed by the extra mass. He therefore unloaded Barnette's cargo on August 26, 1901, with an irate Barnette assisting.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 24</ref>\n\nBarnette began building a cabin at a site he named \"Chenoa City\", and he sold supplies to two [[Prospecting|prospectors]], [[Felix Pedro]] and Tom Gilmore, who were in the area.<ref name=\"Crooked Past, p. 25\">''Crooked Past'', p. 25</ref> Barnette traded for furs, then traveled to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] via [[sled dog|dog team]] with his wife and three other men. The mountain pass they traveled through was later named [[Isabel Pass]] in honor of Barnette's wife.<ref name=\"Crooked Past, p. 25\"/> From Valdez, he returned to St. Michael, where he built a steamboat, the ''Isabelle'', and began sailing up the Yukon in August 1902.<ref name=\"Crooked34\">''Crooked Past'', p. 34</ref> He intended to move his supplies to Tanacross, but when he arrived at his trading post on the Chena River, he changed his mind. Felix Pedro had [[Discovery Claim on Pedro Creek|discovered gold]].<ref name=\"Crooked34\"/>\n\n==Origins of Fairbanks==\nBefore Barnette traveled upriver with the ''Isabelle'', he met Judge [[James Wickersham]] in St. Michael. Wickersham was the judge for the federal Third Judicial District, which stretched from the North Slope to the [[Aleutian Islands]].<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 29</ref> Wickersham was impressed with Barnette and his plan to establish a trading post at Tanacross. He suggested Barnette name his settlement Fairbanks, after [[Charles W. Fairbanks]], the senior [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Indiana]].<ref>https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/charles_fairbanks.pdf</ref> Barnette liked the idea and later said, \"If we should ever want aid at the national capital, we would have the friendship, at least, of someone who could help us.\"<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 32</ref> When Barnette heard of Pedro's gold strike, he transferred the name for his planned Tanacross store to the settlement on the Chena River and convinced the people with him to accept the name.<ref>''Crooked Past'', pp. 38&ndash;39</ref>\n\nWhen Barnette and the ''Isabelle'''s crew heard of Pedro's discovery, they immediately fled the boat and the settlement to stake claims on creeks and likely gold-bearing spots {{convert|12|mi|km}} north, near the mountain and creek Pedro named after himself.<ref name=\"Crooked38\">''Crooked Past'', p. 38</ref> Marking a claim was simple. Each man could pick a set amount of space, which was marked with posts at each corner, hence \"staking\" the claim.<ref>De Windt, Harry. [https://books.google.com/books?id=79DMMjRBtscC&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Through the Gold Fields of Alaska to Bering Straits'']. Chatto & Windus, 1898. pp. 294&ndash;296</ref> Each claim had to be listed by a federal recorder. When Barnette and the crew of the ''Isabelle'' were staking claims, Barnette proclaimed himself the interim recorder until an official one could be brought to the area. Although they also recorded their claims with Barnette, most men also reported their claims at the official office in Circle.<ref name=\"Crooked38\"/> To maximize his gain, Barnette had [[power of attorney]] for several relatives in [[Ohio]]. He staked claims in their names, thus giving him authority over a large portion of what was believed to be the gold-bearing terrain.<ref name=\"Crooked38\"/>\n\nWord of Pedro's discovery spread during the months that followed Barnette's arrival in September 1902. In December, he wrote to a friend in Seattle, \"A message came yesterday that 1,000 people had left [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] during the last three days for here. I look for half of Dawson here before spring.\"<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 40</ref> In January 1903, Barnette's cook, [[Jujiro Wada]], arrived in Dawson City with word of the gold find. On January 17, 1903, the ''Yukon Sun'' newspaper ran the headline \"RICH STRIKE MADE IN THE TANANA\" across most of its front page, spurring miners from the Yukon to stampede to Fairbanks in the first big rush of the settlement's history.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 42</ref>\n\n==Boom==\nWhen the miners from Nome, Dawson, [[Rampart, Alaska|Rampart]], and other places arrived in the Tanana Valley, they were disappointed with what they found. Hundreds of claims were staked, but none were close to Pedro's discovery claims, which had been taken by the crew of the ''Isabelle'' and other early arrivers.<ref name=\"Crooked51\">''Crooked Past'', p. 51</ref> Adding to the pressure on claiming land were men who, like Barnette, had power of attorney rights for others, and could thus make multiple claims. The ''Dawson Daily News'' reported that one man claimed 144 portions of {{convert|20|acre|m2}} apiece.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 52</ref> Around Barnette's trading post, town lots were claimed for $2.50 apiece, and there was fierce competition for the choicest spots.<ref name=\"Crooked50\">''Crooked Past'', p. 50</ref> At the mouth of the Chena River, a competing settlement, named Chena, sprang up when two traders moved their store to the junction of the two rivers. Land [[speculation]] was fierce in Chena, where claims were frequently stolen and had to be enforced with firearms.<ref name=\"Crooked50\"/>\n\nAccounts vary, but historians estimate that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men arrived in the Tanana Valley.<ref name=\"Crooked51\"/> This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 54</ref> Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April, Judge Wickersham arrived on a trip looking for a location for the courthouse, jail, and government offices for the Third District courts. He later described his first view of the settlement: \"A half-dozen new squat log structures, a few tents ... a small clearing in the primitive forest\u2014that was Fairbanks as I first saw it on April 9, 1903.\"<ref>Wickersham, p. 182</ref> Wickersham examined Chena as a potential site for the government offices, but he settled on Fairbanks, partially because Barnette's partner and brother-in-law, Frank Cleary, gave Wickersham a choice piece of land valued at between $1,500 and $2,000.<ref name=\"Crooked58\">''Crooked Past'', p. 58</ref> Wickersham asked Cleary to name the two main streets in town Cushman and Lacey, after [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] [[Francis W. Cushman]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[John F. Lacey]] of [[Iowa]].<ref name=\"Crooked58\"/>\n\nWickersham estimated 500 people in town, and another count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six [[Western saloon|saloon]]s, and no [[Church (building)|church]]es.<ref name=\"Crooked59\">''Crooked Past'', p. 59</ref> Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first newspaper in the settlement\u2014the Fairbanks Miner\u2014on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy.<ref name=\"Crooked59\"/> But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling for as little as $10.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 60</ref> Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged for the establishment of a post office at his settlement.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 62</ref>\n\nIn fall 1903, the flood of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 67</ref> At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble discovered what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska.<ref name=\"survey\">U.S. Geological Survey.

By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 69</ref> Another food shortage arose during the winter of 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 70&ndash;73</ref>\n\nDespite the food shortage, more buildings were constructed. The Northern Commercial Company built a store to replace Barnette's cabin, and Wickersham recorded a wide range of businesses, including 500 houses and 1,200 people.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 73</ref> To manage the growing population, the settlement held a vote on November 10, 1903 to decide whether to [[Municipal corporation|incorporate]] Fairbanks as a town or not. The vote passed, and Barnette was sworn in as the city's first mayor on the next day.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 74&ndash;75</ref>\n\n==City of Fairbanks==\nBarnette's first action as mayor was to write a letter to Washington, D.C., asking the federal government to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the food shortage.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 75</ref> This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds).<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 77</ref> Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 78</ref> In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand.<ref>''Crooked Past'', p. 79</ref> In addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the [[Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System]], which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.

After abortive attempts to transport oil from the field using seagoing tankers and airplanes, the oil companies developing the field decided to build a pipeline.<ref>Naske, Claus M. and Slotnick, Herman E. ''Alaska: A History of the 49th State''. Norman, Oklahoma; University of Oklahoma Press, 1987. Second edition. pp. 256&ndash;257</ref> Plans were set into motion and about to move forward when legal challenges halted the project in 1970. One set of challenges, those levied by Alaska Native groups in the path of the pipeline, was settled by passage of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] in 1971. Thirteen major Alaska Native corporations and dozens of smaller ones were created to manage the cash payment and land grants distributed by the federal government under the act. In 1972, Fairbanks became the headquarters of [[Doyon, Limited]], the largest of these corporations.<ref name=\"T7\">\"Fairbanks Journeys\", p. T7</ref>\n\nThe Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in the period between the discovery of oil and the legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on.<ref>''Gold Rush Town'', p. 201</ref> The challenges were ended by approval of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act]] in late 1973.<ref>Coates, Peter A. ''The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Controversy''. University of Alaska Press, 1991. p. 249</ref> When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. [[Alyeska Pipeline Service Company]] alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright.<ref name=\"Gold203\">''Gold Rush Town'', p. 203</ref> Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.<ref name=\"Gold203\"/>\n\nThis increase in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, ran out of phone numbers and the waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries.<ref>''Gold Rush Town'', p. 202</ref> Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent [[Brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s.<ref name=\"Gold203\"/> Home prices skyrocketed\u2014a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 164</ref> Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 168</ref> One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', p. 167</ref>\n\nThe skyrocketing prices were driven by the high salaries paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', pp. 118&ndash;126</ref> The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could not keep up with the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent.<ref>''Amazing Pipeline Stories'', pp. 127&ndash;128</ref> Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level.

The traditional S\u00e1mi lifestyle, dominated by hunting, fishing and trading, was preserved until the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the modern structures of the [[Nordic countries]] were established.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi have lived in relative co-existence with their neighbors for centuries, but for the last two hundred years, especially during the second half of the 20th century, there have been many dramatic changes in S\u00e1mi culture, politics, economics and their relations with their neighboring societies. During the late 20th century, modern conflicts broke out over the construction of a hydroelectric dam, the reaction to which created a reawakening and defense of S\u00e1mi culture in recent years.  Of the eleven different historically attested [[S\u00e1mi languages]] (traditionally known as \"dialects\"), nine have survived to the present day but with most in danger of disappearing too.\n\nIt is possible that the S\u00e1mi people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the ''[[Fenni]]''. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of [[runes]] and include specifically the [[Account of the Viking Othere]] to [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] of England.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:LocationSapmi.png|right|350px|thumb|The area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people.]]\n\nThe area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people is known in [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] as [[S\u00e1pmi]], and typically includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]]. Previously, the S\u00e1mi have probably inhabited areas further south in Fennoscandia.<ref>''Samenes Historie fram til 1750''. Lars Ivar Hansen and Bjornar Olsen. Cappelen Akademiske Forlag. 2004</ref> A few [[Neolithic|Stone Age]] cultures in the area had been speculated, especially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, to be associated with the ancestors of the S\u00e1mi, though this has been dismissed by modern scholars and extensive DNA testing. \n\n===Origin and Genetic History <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/genetic.htm|title=Origin and Genetic Background of the S\u00e1mi|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>===\nThe genetic origin of S\u00e1mi people is unclear and complex. Despite having a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], it's not believed that they are [[Uralic]] in origin is widely believed that their genetic history is linked to the Finns, considering they share similar features, culture, and language. However, until 1999 the S\u00e1mi had not been placed on any gene map of Europe. It's now well believed that [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] having been living in what is now [[Scandinavia]] since the last [[Last ice age|ice age]] supported by recent studies of  Y chromosomal polymorphisms. It was well believed for centuries that  [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] people were of Asian origin however recent genetic studies dispute this claim, instead showing overwhelming evidence of that S\u00e1mi are descendants of the original peoples of Europe and their genetic and cultural diffusion is from subsequent isolation from other Europeans.\n\n===Ice age===\nFollowing the last [[ice age]], parts of the Norwegian coast line became free of ice in about 11,000 BC, which coincides with the formation of the [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] I ridge system in Finland.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120918061329/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VF0-44N9NHC-S&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9dcee9acd661ed2d930c8b06a53b1d69 Deglaciation chronology of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet from the Lake Onega Basin to the Salpausselk\u00e4 End Moraines]</ref> But it was not until around 7000 BC that all of Fennoscandia was free of ice. The land mass had been pressed downwards by the weight of the ice and was still partially under water.\n\n===Stone Age===\n{{See also|Nordic Stone Age}}\n\nThe commonly held view today is that the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the [[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]] in southern and central Norway and what used to be called the [[Komsa culture]] in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic [[Ahrensburg culture]] of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding [[glaciation]] at the end of the last [[ice age]] opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.\n\nThe term \"Fosna\" is an umbrella term for the oldest settlements along the Norwegian coast, from [[Hordaland]] to [[Nordland]]. The distinction made with the \"Komsa\" type of stone-tool culture north of the Arctic Circle was rendered obsolete in the 1970s. \"Komsa\" itself originally referred to the whole North Norwegian Mesolithic, but the term has since been abandoned by Norwegian archaeologists who now divide the northern Mesolithic into three parts, referred to simply as phases 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=BritNorway>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-214112/Norway \"Norway\"] Britannica online</ref><ref>Olsen, B. 1994.

Finds from the Sujala site, on the shores of Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, in [[Utsjoki]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], include symmetrically shaped tanged points on blades, with symmetrical ventral retouch at the tip. Points of this precise type are very characteristic of the so-called \"Post-[[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] cultures\" of Central and Northwestern Russia and the East Baltic \u2013 but are absent in Ahrensburgian contexts. The finds also include very fine prismatic blades produced by the punch and pressure techniques, which at this time were also typical of eastern blade cultures. The finds are dated to 8,300\u20138,200 years [[Before Present#Radiocarbon calibration|BP]] \u2013 slightly later than the earliest Komsa Phase 1 finds \u2013 and indicate that the first pioneers of the inland area of northern Lapland came from the south-east. There are indications that the two populations came in contact, but which, if either of them, survived into later times remains an open question.<ref>Survey and excavation at Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, Lapland \u2013 Tuija Rankama & Jarmo Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, in: PEOPLE, MATERIAL CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE NORTH, Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu, 18\u201323 August 2004, Edited by Vesa-Pekka Herva [http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514281411/isbn9514281411.pdf]</ref><ref>Rankama, Tuija & Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, Jarmo 2008, \u201cEastern arrivals in post-glacial Lapland: the Sujala site 10 000 cal BP.\u201d Antiquity Vol. 82 No. 318.</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n{{See also|Genetic studies on Sami}}\nThe genetic origin of the S\u00e1mi is still unknown, though recent genetic research may be providing some clues.  Nevertheless, it appears that the S\u00e1mi are still primarily a blend of two populations known as European Hunter Gatherers and the Ancient North Eurasians.<ref>[https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|Distribution map of autosomal DNA in Europe]</ref> A similar blended population is called [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]] on the mainland and was called [[Scandinavian Hunter Gatherer]] when the first ancient remains in Scandinavia were sequenced. Contemporary S\u00e1mi population also shows some blending with the Indo-Europeans through an admixture of genetics similar but not identical to Near Eastern early farmers, called Caucasus Hunter Gatherers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nArcheological evidence suggests that people along the southern shores of [[Lake Onega]] and around [[Lake Ladoga]] reached the River [[Utsjoki]] in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Uncovering+the+secrets+of+the+S%C3%A1mi/1135218761063 Uncovering the secrets of the S\u00e1mi], a February 2006 ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' article</ref> However, it is not likely that Sami languages are so old. According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the [[Proto-Samic language|Sami proto-language]] developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000\u20132500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aikio |first=Ante |contribution=An essay on substrate studies and the origin of Saami |editor1-last=Hyv\u00e4rinen |editor1-first=Irma |editor2-last=Kallio |editor2-first=Petri |editor3-last=Korhonen |editor3-first=Jarmo |title=Etymologie, Entlehnungen und Entwicklungen: Festschrift f\u00fcr Jorma Koivulehto zum 70.

The uniqueness of the Sami gene pool has made it one of the most extensively studied genetic populations in the world.  The most frequent Sami MtDNA (female) [[haplotype]] is U5b1, with type V also common.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Before the 15th century ==\nHistorically, the S\u00e1mi inhabited all of Finland and [[Eastern Karelia]] for a long time, though the Eastern S\u00e1mi became assimilated into the Finnish and Karelian populations after settlers from [[Tavastia (historical province)|H\u00e4me]], [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]], and [[Karelia]] migrated into the region. Placenames, e.g. [[Nuuksio]] on the south coast of Finland, remain as proof of former S\u00e1mi settlement.

The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle the contemporary question of S\u00e1mi land rights. He concluded that the S\u00e1mi had lived no further south than [[Lierne]] in [[Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake [[Femunden]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Yngvar Nielsen|authorlink= Yngvar Nielsen|year=1891 |title=Lappernes fremrykning mod syd i Trondhjems stift og Hedemarkens amt |trans-title=The incursion of Lapps southwards in the see of Trondhjem and county of Hedemarken |journal=Det Norske Geografiske Selskabs \u00e5rbog |volume=1 |issue=1889\u20131890 |pages=18\u201352 |location=Kristiania |language=Norwegian }}</ref> This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no S\u00e1mi settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the S\u00e1mi culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources.<ref name=\"Gjerde\">{{cite journal |author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans-title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197\u2013210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}</ref> In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a S\u00e1mi presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages has increased. These include foundations in [[Lesja]], in [[Vang, Oppland|Vang]] in [[Valdres]] and in [[Hol]] and [[\u00c5l]] in [[Hallingdal]].<ref name=\"Gjerde\" /> Proponents of the S\u00e1mi interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and S\u00e1mi people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.<ref>{{rp|208}}</ref>\n\nUp to around 1500 the S\u00e1mi were mainly fishermen and trappers, usually in a combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the [[reindeer]]. Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked by the fact that the S\u00e1mi had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most S\u00e1mi then settled along the [[fjord]]s, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the S\u00e1mi then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.\n\nIt is believed that since the [[Viking Age]], the S\u00e1mi culture has been driven further and further north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there are some folklore called ''stalo'' or tales, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]] to be histories of [[Vikings]] interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).\n\nAlong the Northern Norwegian coast, the S\u00e1mi culture came under pressure during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The nature of the Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the S\u00e1mi were quite happy to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from the area around the White Sea.\n\nHowever, in the early Middle Ages, this is partly reversed, as the power of the chieftains are broken by the centralized Norwegian state. Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of [[Finnmark]] province is triggered by the fish trade in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the S\u00e1mi lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.\n\n==S\u00e1mi art==\n[[Image:Southern Sami braid design Sydsamiskt fl\u00e4tm\u00f6nster Lullis\u00e1me duodji \u00c5arjelsaemien baerkieldidh.gif|200px|right|thumb|Southern S\u00e1mi braid design]]\nTraditionally, S\u00e1mi art has been distinguished by its combination of functional appropriateness and vibrant, decorative beauty.  Both qualities grew out of a deep respect for nature, embodied in the S\u00e1mi's animism.  Their religion found its most complete expression in [[Shamanism]], evident in their worship of the ''seite'', an unusually shaped rock or tree stump that was assumed to be the home of a deity. Pictorial and sculptural art in the Western sense is a 20th-century innovation in S\u00e1mi culture used to preserve and develop key aspects of a pantheistic culture, dependent on the rhythms of the seasons.<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref>\n\n== An economic shift ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nFrom the 15th century on, the S\u00e1mi came under increased pressure. The surrounding states, Denmark-Norway, Sweden-Finland and Russia showed increased interest in the S\u00e1mi areas. Sweden, at the time blocked from the North Sea by [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian territory]], was interested in a port at the Atlantic coast, and Russian expansion also reached the coasts of the Barents Sea. All claimed the right to tax the S\u00e1mi people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the [[Harstad]] area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the [[Kola peninsula]].\n\nHence the hunting intensified, and the number of wild reindeer declined. The S\u00e1mi were forced to do something else. Reindeer husbandry started in a limited way.  These tamed reindeer were trained to divert wild reindeer over a cliff or into hunting ditches.  Reindeer husbandry intensified.\n\nThe majority of S\u00e1mi settled along the inland rivers, fjords or coast.  They started augmenting their diet and income by fishing, either sea or freshwater, hunting other game and keeping cows, sheep and goats.\n\n[[Reindeer]] and other animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today [[Animal husbandry|reindeer husbandry]] is of dwindling economic relevance for the S\u00e1mi people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.\n\n''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'' (1673), written by the [[rhetoric]]ian [[Johannes Schefferus]], is the oldest source of detailed information on S\u00e1mi culture. It was written due to \"ill-natured\" foreign propaganda (in particular from Germany) claiming that Sweden had won victories on the battlefield by means of S\u00e1mi [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In attempts to correct the picture of S\u00e1mi culture amongst the Europeans, [[Magnus de la Gardie]] started an early '[[ethnological]]' research project to document S\u00e1mi groups, conducted by Schefferus. The book was published in late 1673 and quickly translated to [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], English, and other languages (though not to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] until 1956). However, an adapted and abridged version was quickly published in the Netherlands and Germany, where chapters on their difficult living conditions, topography, and the environment had been replaced by made-up stories of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[drum]]s and [[Paganism|heathenry]]. But there was also criticism against the ethnography, claiming S\u00e1mi to be more warlike in character, rather than the image Schefferus presented.\n\n==Swedish advances into S\u00e1pmi==\n\n{{see also|Lappmarken}}\n\nSince the 15th century, the S\u00e1mi people have traditionally been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century [[Gustav I of Sweden]] officially claimed that all S\u00e1mi should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway\u2014at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border was set up to be the water flux line in [[Fennoscandia]]. After this \"unification\", the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called [[birkarl]]s, ceased to exist, especially with the new king [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] who swore by his crown to be the \"... Lappers j Nordlanden, the Caijaners\" king 1607.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040705050558/http://www.geocities.com/eurprin/sweden.html Titles of European hereditary rulers - Sweden] Konung Christoffers Landslag. Edictum Regis Caroli IX eius iussu edito textui praescriptum</ref> [[Yoik]]ing, drumming and sacrifices were now abandoned and seen as (juridical terms) \"magic\" or \"sorcery\", something that was probably aimed at removing opposition against the crown. The hard custody of S\u00e1mi peoples resulted in a great loss of S\u00e1mi culture.\n\nIn the 1630s Swedish authorities imposed a [[corv\u00e9e|corve\u00e9 system]] on [[sami people|sami]] communities near [[Nasa silver mine]].<ref name=Hansson2015-17>Hansson 2015, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Hansson2015-18>Hansson 2015, p. 18.</ref> Mining at Nasa siulver mine proved unprofitable and ended in 1659 it nevertheless caused many sami to move to [[Torne lappmark]] in the 1640s and 1650s to avoid forced labour.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/> There are reports of sami who served in the mining activities becoming extremely empoverished turning into beggars as concequence.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/>  \n\nThe boundary agreement (like a \"Codex Lapponia\") between Sweden and Norway had an attachment; frequently called ''Lappkodicillen'' or \"Samic [[Magna Carta]]\". It has the same meaning for S\u00e1mi even today (or at least till 2005), but is only a [[Treaty|convention]] between Sweden and Norway and does not include Finland and Russia. It regulates how the land is shared by S\u00e1mi peoples between the border of Sweden and Norway.\n\nAfter the 17th century, many S\u00e1mi families lost the right to use Swedish land since they were poor and could not pay tribute for it like other subjects. The state also took the S\u00e1mi area in tighter control with specific [[Lappmarken|Lappmark Regulations]], enforcing non-S\u00e1mi settlements on the area. This fostered opposition among S\u00e1mi groups that wanted hunting, fishing, and pastoralistic areas back. Instead other groups often took over to put more use to the land. It was also at this time the county of [[Laponia (historical province)|Lappland]] was established in Sweden.\n\n==Russian interest==\nIn the 16th century, as part of a general expansion period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the far reaches of the empire, and several [[Russian Orthodox]] chapels were built on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. The westernmost advance was St. George's chapel in [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]]/Njavdam near [[Kirkenes]] in the Norwegian/Russian borderlands. \n\n==Dano-Norwegian policies in the North==\nOn the Norwegian side, the S\u00e1mi were converted to the Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the S\u00e1mi were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. They were free to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.\n\n==19th century: Increased pressure==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Carl B\u00f8gh - En rensdyrhjord drives til malkepladsen.

In 1826, the [[Norway\u2013Russia border|Norwegian/Russian border]] treaty finally drew the border between Norway and Finland-Russia, where large tracts of land had previously been more or less governing themselves under very light joint control from Russia, Sweden and Denmark-Norway. This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi crossed the borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. S\u00e1mi were still free to cross the border between Sweden and Norway according to inherited rights laid down in the [[Lapp Codicil of 1751]] until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany's occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer pasturages are today used by S\u00e1mi originating in Kautokeino.\n\nFor long periods of time, the S\u00e1mi lifestyle reigned supreme in the north because of its unique adaptation to the [[Arctic]] environment, enabling S\u00e1mi culture to resist cultural influences from the South. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the S\u00e1mi cultural element was strengthened, since the S\u00e1mi were independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\n===Economical marginalization===\nIn all countries, the 19th century was a period of economic growth. In Norway, cities were founded and fish exports increased. The S\u00e1mi way of life became increasingly outdated, and the S\u00e1mi were marginalized and left out of the general expansion.\n\n===Christianization and the Laestadius Movement===\nIn the 1840s, the Swedish S\u00e1mi minister, [[Lars Levi Laestadius]], preached a particularly strict version of the Lutheran teachings. This led to a religious awakening among the S\u00e1mi across every border, often with much animosity towards the authorities and the established church. In 1852, this led to riots in the municipality of [[Kautokeino]], where the minister was badly beaten and the local tradesman slain by fanatic \"crusaders\".  The leaders of the riots were later executed or condemned to long imprisonment. After this initial violent outbreak, the Laestadius movement continued to gain ground in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the leaders now insisted on a more cooperative attitude with the authorities.\n\n===Cultural pressure===\nIn Norway, the use of S\u00e1mi in teaching and preaching had initially been encouraged. However, with the rise in nationalism in Norway from the 1860s onward, the Norwegian authorities changed their policies in a more nationalistic direction. From around 1900 this was intensified, and no S\u00e1mi could be used in public school or in the official church.\n\n== The Early 20th Century through World War II ==\n[[File:Lappeleir (27873424552).jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi camp in Norway, c. 1900, painted by [[Wilhelm Peters (painter)|Wilhelm Peters]]]] \n[[File:Older postcard with Sami.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi people in Norway]]\nIn the 20th century, Norwegian authorities put the S\u00e1mi culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and culture universal. A strong economical development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts; however, strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the S\u00e1mi.\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out S\u00e1mi culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]], had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the [[Dislocation of S\u00e1mi people|dislocation]] in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local S\u00e1mi groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal S\u00e1mi ethnic conflict. \n\nJust as every portion of the European continent, the circumpolar lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union were not spared the wrath of World War II. For the Saami, who had no concept of national sovereignty, the concept of nations fighting over land was alien. Never less, the Saami would become entrapped in the conflict from all sides. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944-45, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of S\u00e1mi culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed somewhat.\n\n===Prewar hardliners in Norway===\n{{See also|Norwegianization}}\n\nThe 20th century started with yet increased pressure on the Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and S\u00e1mi language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright ridiculous and even the product of an inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the policies were at first markedly less militant. Teachers followed S\u00e1mi reindeer herders to provide education for the children, but S\u00e1mi areas were increasingly exploited by the then new mines in [[Kiruna]] and [[G\u00e4llivare]] and the construction of the Lule\u00e5-Narvik railway.\n\nLater, with the founding of the [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|Swedish Race Biology Institute]], S\u00e1mi graves were plundered to provide research material.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|title=Museum of Dalarna \"The dark legacy\" exhibition in Sweden |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2007 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage 31 May 2010\">{{Cite news|title=University in quest to return Sami bones |last=Savage |first=James |authorlink= |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=The Local: Sweden's News in English |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.thelocal.se/26954/20100531/ }}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the age-old ways of life of the S\u00e1mi were brutally interrupted by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most S\u00e1mi were organized in a single [[kolkhoz]], located in the central part of the Peninsula, at Lovozero (S\u00e1mi: ''Lojavri''). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the S\u00e1mi people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and other Arctic peoples.\n\n=== [[Winter War|Winter War (1939-1940):]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nThe first fighting Saami became entangled in was between Finland and the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939 when the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the Soviets were denied the ability to construct military bases there. [[Red Army|The Red Army]], believing that they could easily march across Finland to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], made the mistake of invading Finland during an unusually cold winter and suffered 27,000 casualties compared to the Finnish mere 2,700. However, as the weather warmed in March of 1940, the Finnish line was breached and facing the far larger Soviet forces, was forced to sue for peace on March 12. \n\n=== German invasion and occupation of Norway: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nOn April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1940 Hitler began [[Norwegian campaign order of battle|Operation Weser]] and invaded Norway. With assistance from Norwegian Defense Minister and Nazi sympathizer [[Vidkun Quisling]], the Germans were quickly able to gain a foothold. The Nazi\u2019s viewed ethnic \u201cNordic Norwegians\u201d who are Germanic and oftentimes blonde haired and blue eyed to be Aryans just like Germans. Quisling shared their view and proposed the complete eradication of the Saami people who he viewed as ethnically inferior. Despite the urging of Winston Churchill, British support for the Norwegians was appalling slow, an action that is responsible for making him Prime Minister. As a result, the Nazis easily capture the Northern port of [[Narvik]]. Despite a blockade by the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Nav]]<nowiki/>y, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] were able to hide in the mountains by forcing local Saami to serve as guides.\n\nOn April 20<sup>th</sup> 1940, [[King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government fled to London along with most of the allied troops stationed there and formed a government in exile, however Norwegians continued fighting the Nazis through underground resistance. These resistance fighters included many S\u00e1ami who had formerly served as part of the Norwegian Ski Brigade and were instrumental in destroying a secret German Nuclear base in [[Telemark]] in 1944. However, many other Norwegian S\u00e1ami were forced into labor for the SS in mining to mine iron ore and build a railway from Narvik to Finland through [[Finnmark]]. Forced sterilization and deportations were also not uncommon \n\n=== [[Continuation War|Continuation War:]] ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler offered Finland assistance in recapturing the lost territory to the Soviets. Finnish Saami were especially receptive to the idea because the much Kola peninsula which Russia had seized was their homeland. However, Finland never formerly joined the Axis powers, remained a democracy, and no Finnish Jews were ever deported during the Holocaust. The Finns with assistance from the SS Nord invaded South Kola on June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1941. Most Finnish Saami served as part of the \u201cLong Distance Patrol\u201d because of their abilities on skis and familiarity with the terrain.\n\nUnfortunately, Finnish Saami, being supplied by forced labor of Norwegian Saami, were forced to fight Russian Saami during this phase of the war. Many Saami fighting for the Soviets attempted to defect to the Finnish side. With Finnish assistance, many Saami villages in the Soviet territory were evacuated to Sweden for the remainder of the war. However, other Saami were not so lucky and along with many other Soviet soldiers and civilians were placed in prison and even concentration camps. This angered the Finnish government who also refused to assist the Wehrmacht in seizing Leningrad. Eventually the tide turned in favor of the Red Army and Soviet troops marched back into Finland and on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 1944, the Red Army got within striking distance of Helsinki. The Finns sued for peace and lost much territory including a large part of Saami.\n\n===[[Lapland War|Lapland War (1944-45)]] ===\nAs a result of Finland's peace deal with the Soviets, German troops were required to leave the country. Finland wished to reconquer the towns under German occupation. As a result, mostly Sa\u00e1mi troops interested in reconquering their homeland.The withdrawal of the German Wehrmacht from Northern Finland and far north of Norway meant that all houses, roads and infrastructure were destroyed. This meant forced evacuation, destruction, an economic setback and the loss of all visible history. The Germans committed many atrocities against the Norwegians and Norwegian Sa\u00e1mi at this time including raping hundreds of women, many of whom committed suicide because of the trauma. The [[Finnmark]] province, the north-eastern municipalities of [[Troms]] province and all of the northern areas of Finland were but smoking ruins. Eventually Soviet Troops fulling invaded Sampi with the asistance of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norweigian Army in Exile]] and liberated Finnish Lappland and Finnmark. On April 26th 1945 [[Liberation of Finnmark|Finnmark was finally liberated.]] \n\n==Renewed interest==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nNews in S\u00e1mi on national radio in Norway started in 1946. At about the same time, experiments were being done with bilingual teachings of the alphabet in the first and second grade, to ease the learning process. However, the presence of a S\u00e1mi minority in Norway was largely ignored. Education, communication, industrialization, all contributed to integrating S\u00e1mi communities into Norwegian society at the point of losing identity.\n\nThe conflicts between S\u00e1mi and the Nordic governments continued into the mid 20th century. The proposed construction of the hydro power dam in the 1960s and 1970s contained [[Alta controversy|controversial]] propositions such as putting a village ([[M\u00e1ze]]) and a cemetery under water.\n\nOnly a minor part is today working with reindeer husbandry. There are also minor groups working as fishermen, producing S\u00e1mi arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length in the [[S\u00e1mi parliaments]] (with differing levels of authority and autonomy in various countries) or influence in any [[S\u00e1mi language]], the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of [[Norrland]] (and not only [[S\u00e1mi villages]]) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.\n\nWith the creation of the [[Republic of Finland]] in the first half of the 20th century, the S\u00e1mi inhabiting this area were no longer under the rule of the Russian Empire, but instead citizens of the newly created state of Finland.  The [[S\u00e1mi Parliament of Finland]] was created in 1973.  One recent issue concerning S\u00e1mi rights in Finland is the foresting of traditional S\u00e1mi land by state-owned Finnish companies.\n\nSince 1992, the S\u00e1mi have had their own national day; the February 6.\n\nIn 1898 and 1907/08 some S\u00e1mi emigrated to [[Alaska]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], respectively, due to requests from the American government. Their mission was to teach reindeer herding to Native Americans.

It died out when the Kainuu S\u00e1mi assimilated and was replaced by [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nThe original inhabitants of Kainuu were S\u00e1mi hunter-fisherers. In the 17th century, the [[Governor General of Finland]] [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] fostered the population growth of Kainuu by giving a ten-year [[tax exemption]] to settlers. It was necessary to populate Kainuu with Finnish farmers because the area was threatened from the east by the Russians.\n\nThere are only 14,600 S\u00e1mi living in Sweden today.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SE | publisher = Ethnologue | title = Languages of Sweden}}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Already the ancient Romans knew about the Phinnoi, the people that hunted with arrowheads made from bone.

The traditional S\u00e1mi lifestyle, dominated by hunting, fishing and trading, was preserved until the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the modern structures of the [[Nordic countries]] were established.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi have lived in relative co-existence with their neighbors for centuries, but for the last two hundred years, especially during the second half of the 20th century, there have been many dramatic changes in S\u00e1mi culture, politics, economics and their relations with their neighboring societies. During the late 20th century, modern conflicts broke out over the construction of a hydroelectric dam, the reaction to which created a reawakening and defense of S\u00e1mi culture in recent years.  Of the eleven different historically attested [[S\u00e1mi languages]] (traditionally known as \"dialects\"), nine have survived to the present day but with most in danger of disappearing too.\n\nIt is possible that the S\u00e1mi people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the ''[[Fenni]]''. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of [[runes]] and include specifically the [[Account of the Viking Othere]] to [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] of England.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:LocationSapmi.png|right|350px|thumb|The area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people.]]\n\nThe area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people is known in [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] as [[S\u00e1pmi]], and typically includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]].

Despite having a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], it's not believed that they are [[Uralic]] in origin is widely believed that their genetic history is linked to the Finns, considering they share similar features, culture, and language. However, until 1999 the S\u00e1mi had not been placed on any gene map of Europe. It's now well believed that [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] having been living in what is now [[Scandinavia]] since the last [[Last ice age|ice age]] supported by recent studies of  Y chromosomal polymorphisms. It was well believed for centuries that  [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] people were of Asian origin however recent genetic studies dispute this claim, instead showing overwhelming evidence of that S\u00e1mi are descendants of the original peoples of Europe and their genetic and cultural diffusion is from subsequent isolation from other Europeans.\n\n===Ice age===\nFollowing the last [[ice age]], parts of the Norwegian coast line became free of ice in about 11,000 BC, which coincides with the formation of the [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] I ridge system in Finland.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120918061329/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VF0-44N9NHC-S&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9dcee9acd661ed2d930c8b06a53b1d69 Deglaciation chronology of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet from the Lake Onega Basin to the Salpausselk\u00e4 End Moraines]</ref> But it was not until around 7000 BC that all of Fennoscandia was free of ice. The land mass had been pressed downwards by the weight of the ice and was still partially under water.\n\n===Stone Age===\n{{See also|Nordic Stone Age}}\n\nThe commonly held view today is that the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the [[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]] in southern and central Norway and what used to be called the [[Komsa culture]] in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic [[Ahrensburg culture]] of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding [[glaciation]] at the end of the last [[ice age]] opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.\n\nThe term \"Fosna\" is an umbrella term for the oldest settlements along the Norwegian coast, from [[Hordaland]] to [[Nordland]]. The distinction made with the \"Komsa\" type of stone-tool culture north of the Arctic Circle was rendered obsolete in the 1970s. \"Komsa\" itself originally referred to the whole North Norwegian Mesolithic, but the term has since been abandoned by Norwegian archaeologists who now divide the northern Mesolithic into three parts, referred to simply as phases 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=BritNorway>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-214112/Norway \"Norway\"] Britannica online</ref><ref>Olsen, B. 1994.

Finds from the Sujala site, on the shores of Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, in [[Utsjoki]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], include symmetrically shaped tanged points on blades, with symmetrical ventral retouch at the tip. Points of this precise type are very characteristic of the so-called \"Post-[[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] cultures\" of Central and Northwestern Russia and the East Baltic \u2013 but are absent in Ahrensburgian contexts. The finds also include very fine prismatic blades produced by the punch and pressure techniques, which at this time were also typical of eastern blade cultures. The finds are dated to 8,300\u20138,200 years [[Before Present#Radiocarbon calibration|BP]] \u2013 slightly later than the earliest Komsa Phase 1 finds \u2013 and indicate that the first pioneers of the inland area of northern Lapland came from the south-east.

The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle the contemporary question of S\u00e1mi land rights. He concluded that the S\u00e1mi had lived no further south than [[Lierne]] in [[Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake [[Femunden]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Yngvar Nielsen|authorlink= Yngvar Nielsen|year=1891 |title=Lappernes fremrykning mod syd i Trondhjems stift og Hedemarkens amt |trans-title=The incursion of Lapps southwards in the see of Trondhjem and county of Hedemarken |journal=Det Norske Geografiske Selskabs \u00e5rbog |volume=1 |issue=1889\u20131890 |pages=18\u201352 |location=Kristiania |language=Norwegian }}</ref> This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no S\u00e1mi settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the S\u00e1mi culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources.<ref name=\"Gjerde\">{{cite journal |author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans-title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197\u2013210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}</ref> In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a S\u00e1mi presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages has increased.

Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked by the fact that the S\u00e1mi had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most S\u00e1mi then settled along the [[fjord]]s, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the S\u00e1mi then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.\n\nIt is believed that since the [[Viking Age]], the S\u00e1mi culture has been driven further and further north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there are some folklore called ''stalo'' or tales, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]] to be histories of [[Vikings]] interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).\n\nAlong the Northern Norwegian coast, the S\u00e1mi culture came under pressure during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The nature of the Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the S\u00e1mi were quite happy to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from the area around the White Sea.\n\nHowever, in the early Middle Ages, this is partly reversed, as the power of the chieftains are broken by the centralized Norwegian state. Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of [[Finnmark]] province is triggered by the fish trade in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the S\u00e1mi lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.\n\n==S\u00e1mi art==\n[[Image:Southern Sami braid design Sydsamiskt fl\u00e4tm\u00f6nster Lullis\u00e1me duodji \u00c5arjelsaemien baerkieldidh.gif|200px|right|thumb|Southern S\u00e1mi braid design]]\nTraditionally, S\u00e1mi art has been distinguished by its combination of functional appropriateness and vibrant, decorative beauty.  Both qualities grew out of a deep respect for nature, embodied in the S\u00e1mi's animism.  Their religion found its most complete expression in [[Shamanism]], evident in their worship of the ''seite'', an unusually shaped rock or tree stump that was assumed to be the home of a deity. Pictorial and sculptural art in the Western sense is a 20th-century innovation in S\u00e1mi culture used to preserve and develop key aspects of a pantheistic culture, dependent on the rhythms of the seasons.<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref>\n\n== An economic shift ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nFrom the 15th century on, the S\u00e1mi came under increased pressure. The surrounding states, Denmark-Norway, Sweden-Finland and Russia showed increased interest in the S\u00e1mi areas. Sweden, at the time blocked from the North Sea by [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian territory]], was interested in a port at the Atlantic coast, and Russian expansion also reached the coasts of the Barents Sea. All claimed the right to tax the S\u00e1mi people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the [[Harstad]] area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the [[Kola peninsula]].\n\nHence the hunting intensified, and the number of wild reindeer declined. The S\u00e1mi were forced to do something else. Reindeer husbandry started in a limited way.  These tamed reindeer were trained to divert wild reindeer over a cliff or into hunting ditches.  Reindeer husbandry intensified.\n\nThe majority of S\u00e1mi settled along the inland rivers, fjords or coast.  They started augmenting their diet and income by fishing, either sea or freshwater, hunting other game and keeping cows, sheep and goats.\n\n[[Reindeer]] and other animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today [[Animal husbandry|reindeer husbandry]] is of dwindling economic relevance for the S\u00e1mi people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.\n\n''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'' (1673), written by the [[rhetoric]]ian [[Johannes Schefferus]], is the oldest source of detailed information on S\u00e1mi culture. It was written due to \"ill-natured\" foreign propaganda (in particular from Germany) claiming that Sweden had won victories on the battlefield by means of S\u00e1mi [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In attempts to correct the picture of S\u00e1mi culture amongst the Europeans, [[Magnus de la Gardie]] started an early '[[ethnological]]' research project to document S\u00e1mi groups, conducted by Schefferus. The book was published in late 1673 and quickly translated to [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], English, and other languages (though not to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] until 1956). However, an adapted and abridged version was quickly published in the Netherlands and Germany, where chapters on their difficult living conditions, topography, and the environment had been replaced by made-up stories of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[drum]]s and [[Paganism|heathenry]]. But there was also criticism against the ethnography, claiming S\u00e1mi to be more warlike in character, rather than the image Schefferus presented.\n\n==Swedish advances into S\u00e1pmi==\n\n{{see also|Lappmarken}}\n\nSince the 15th century, the S\u00e1mi people have traditionally been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century [[Gustav I of Sweden]] officially claimed that all S\u00e1mi should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway\u2014at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border was set up to be the water flux line in [[Fennoscandia]]. After this \"unification\", the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called [[birkarl]]s, ceased to exist, especially with the new king [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] who swore by his crown to be the \"... Lappers j Nordlanden, the Caijaners\" king 1607.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040705050558/http://www.geocities.com/eurprin/sweden.html Titles of European hereditary rulers - Sweden] Konung Christoffers Landslag. Edictum Regis Caroli IX eius iussu edito textui praescriptum</ref> [[Yoik]]ing, drumming and sacrifices were now abandoned and seen as (juridical terms) \"magic\" or \"sorcery\", something that was probably aimed at removing opposition against the crown. The hard custody of S\u00e1mi peoples resulted in a great loss of S\u00e1mi culture.\n\nIn the 1630s Swedish authorities imposed a [[corv\u00e9e|corve\u00e9 system]] on [[sami people|sami]] communities near [[Nasa silver mine]].<ref name=Hansson2015-17>Hansson 2015, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Hansson2015-18>Hansson 2015, p. 18.</ref> Mining at Nasa siulver mine proved unprofitable and ended in 1659 it nevertheless caused many sami to move to [[Torne lappmark]] in the 1640s and 1650s to avoid forced labour.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/> There are reports of sami who served in the mining activities becoming extremely empoverished turning into beggars as concequence.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/>  \n\nThe boundary agreement (like a \"Codex Lapponia\") between Sweden and Norway had an attachment; frequently called ''Lappkodicillen'' or \"Samic [[Magna Carta]]\". It has the same meaning for S\u00e1mi even today (or at least till 2005), but is only a [[Treaty|convention]] between Sweden and Norway and does not include Finland and Russia. It regulates how the land is shared by S\u00e1mi peoples between the border of Sweden and Norway.\n\nAfter the 17th century, many S\u00e1mi families lost the right to use Swedish land since they were poor and could not pay tribute for it like other subjects. The state also took the S\u00e1mi area in tighter control with specific [[Lappmarken|Lappmark Regulations]], enforcing non-S\u00e1mi settlements on the area. This fostered opposition among S\u00e1mi groups that wanted hunting, fishing, and pastoralistic areas back. Instead other groups often took over to put more use to the land. It was also at this time the county of [[Laponia (historical province)|Lappland]] was established in Sweden.\n\n==Russian interest==\nIn the 16th century, as part of a general expansion period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the far reaches of the empire, and several [[Russian Orthodox]] chapels were built on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. The westernmost advance was St. George's chapel in [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]]/Njavdam near [[Kirkenes]] in the Norwegian/Russian borderlands. \n\n==Dano-Norwegian policies in the North==\nOn the Norwegian side, the S\u00e1mi were converted to the Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the S\u00e1mi were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. They were free to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.\n\n==19th century: Increased pressure==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Carl B\u00f8gh - En rensdyrhjord drives til malkepladsen.

In 1826, the [[Norway\u2013Russia border|Norwegian/Russian border]] treaty finally drew the border between Norway and Finland-Russia, where large tracts of land had previously been more or less governing themselves under very light joint control from Russia, Sweden and Denmark-Norway. This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi crossed the borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. S\u00e1mi were still free to cross the border between Sweden and Norway according to inherited rights laid down in the [[Lapp Codicil of 1751]] until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany's occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer pasturages are today used by S\u00e1mi originating in Kautokeino.\n\nFor long periods of time, the S\u00e1mi lifestyle reigned supreme in the north because of its unique adaptation to the [[Arctic]] environment, enabling S\u00e1mi culture to resist cultural influences from the South. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the S\u00e1mi cultural element was strengthened, since the S\u00e1mi were independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\n===Economical marginalization===\nIn all countries, the 19th century was a period of economic growth. In Norway, cities were founded and fish exports increased. The S\u00e1mi way of life became increasingly outdated, and the S\u00e1mi were marginalized and left out of the general expansion.\n\n===Christianization and the Laestadius Movement===\nIn the 1840s, the Swedish S\u00e1mi minister, [[Lars Levi Laestadius]], preached a particularly strict version of the Lutheran teachings. This led to a religious awakening among the S\u00e1mi across every border, often with much animosity towards the authorities and the established church. In 1852, this led to riots in the municipality of [[Kautokeino]], where the minister was badly beaten and the local tradesman slain by fanatic \"crusaders\".  The leaders of the riots were later executed or condemned to long imprisonment. After this initial violent outbreak, the Laestadius movement continued to gain ground in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the leaders now insisted on a more cooperative attitude with the authorities.\n\n===Cultural pressure===\nIn Norway, the use of S\u00e1mi in teaching and preaching had initially been encouraged. However, with the rise in nationalism in Norway from the 1860s onward, the Norwegian authorities changed their policies in a more nationalistic direction. From around 1900 this was intensified, and no S\u00e1mi could be used in public school or in the official church.\n\n== The Early 20th Century through World War II ==\n[[File:Lappeleir (27873424552).jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi camp in Norway, c. 1900, painted by [[Wilhelm Peters (painter)|Wilhelm Peters]]]] \n[[File:Older postcard with Sami.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi people in Norway]]\nIn the 20th century, Norwegian authorities put the S\u00e1mi culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and culture universal. A strong economical development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts; however, strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the S\u00e1mi.\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out S\u00e1mi culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]], had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the [[Dislocation of S\u00e1mi people|dislocation]] in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local S\u00e1mi groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal S\u00e1mi ethnic conflict. \n\nJust as every portion of the European continent, the circumpolar lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union were not spared the wrath of World War II. For the Saami, who had no concept of national sovereignty, the concept of nations fighting over land was alien. Never less, the Saami would become entrapped in the conflict from all sides. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944-45, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of S\u00e1mi culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed somewhat.\n\n===Prewar hardliners in Norway===\n{{See also|Norwegianization}}\n\nThe 20th century started with yet increased pressure on the Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and S\u00e1mi language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright ridiculous and even the product of an inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the policies were at first markedly less militant. Teachers followed S\u00e1mi reindeer herders to provide education for the children, but S\u00e1mi areas were increasingly exploited by the then new mines in [[Kiruna]] and [[G\u00e4llivare]] and the construction of the Lule\u00e5-Narvik railway.\n\nLater, with the founding of the [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|Swedish Race Biology Institute]], S\u00e1mi graves were plundered to provide research material.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|title=Museum of Dalarna \"The dark legacy\" exhibition in Sweden |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2007 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage 31 May 2010\">{{Cite news|title=University in quest to return Sami bones |last=Savage |first=James |authorlink= |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=The Local: Sweden's News in English |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.thelocal.se/26954/20100531/ }}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the age-old ways of life of the S\u00e1mi were brutally interrupted by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most S\u00e1mi were organized in a single [[kolkhoz]], located in the central part of the Peninsula, at Lovozero (S\u00e1mi: ''Lojavri''). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the S\u00e1mi people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and other Arctic peoples.\n\n=== [[Winter War|Winter War (1939-1940):]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nThe first fighting Saami became entangled in was between Finland and the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939 when the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the Soviets were denied the ability to construct military bases there. [[Red Army|The Red Army]], believing that they could easily march across Finland to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], made the mistake of invading Finland during an unusually cold winter and suffered 27,000 casualties compared to the Finnish mere 2,700. However, as the weather warmed in March of 1940, the Finnish line was breached and facing the far larger Soviet forces, was forced to sue for peace on March 12. As in other Soviet occupied regions of [[Lappland|Sampi]], the local Sami fell victim to forced collectivization into [[Kolkhoz]]\u2019s, mass deportations, and [[Russification]].\n\n=== German invasion and occupation of Norway: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nOn April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1940 Hitler began [[Norwegian campaign order of battle|Operation Weser]] and invaded Norway. With assistance from Norwegian Defense Minister and Nazi sympathizer [[Vidkun Quisling]], the Germans were quickly able to gain a foothold. The Nazi\u2019s viewed ethnic \u201cNordic Norwegians\u201d who are Germanic and oftentimes blonde haired and blue eyed to be Aryans just like Germans. Quisling shared their view and proposed the complete eradication of the Saami people who he viewed as ethnically inferior. Despite the urging of Winston Churchill, British support for the Norwegians was appalling slow, an action that is responsible for making him Prime Minister. As a result, the Nazis easily capture the Northern port of [[Narvik]]. Despite a blockade by the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Nav]]<nowiki/>y, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] were able to hide in the mountains by forcing local Saami to serve as guides.\n\nOn April 20<sup>th</sup> 1940, [[King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government fled to London along with most of the allied troops stationed there and formed a government in exile, however Norwegians continued fighting the Nazis through underground resistance. These resistance fighters included many S\u00e1ami who had formerly served as part of the Norwegian Ski Brigade and were instrumental in destroying a secret German Nuclear base in [[Telemark]] in 1944. However, many other Norwegian S\u00e1ami were forced into labor for the SS in mining to mine iron ore and build a railway from Narvik to Finland through [[Finnmark]]. Forced sterilization and deportations were also not uncommon \n\n=== [[Continuation War|Continuation War:]] ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler offered Finland assistance in recapturing the lost territory to the Soviets. Finnish Saami were especially receptive to the idea because the much Kola peninsula which Russia had seized was their homeland. However, Finland never formerly joined the Axis powers, remained a democracy, and no Finnish Jews were ever deported during the Holocaust. The Finns with assistance from the SS Nord invaded South Kola on June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1941. Most Finnish Saami served as part of the \u201cLong Distance Patrol\u201d because of their abilities on skis and familiarity with the terrain.\n\nUnfortunately, Finnish Saami, being supplied by forced labor of Norwegian Saami, were forced to fight Russian Saami during this phase of the war. Many Saami fighting for the Soviets attempted to defect to the Finnish side. With Finnish assistance, many Saami villages in the Soviet territory were evacuated to Sweden for the remainder of the war. However, other Saami were not so lucky and along with many other Soviet soldiers and civilians were placed in prison and even concentration camps. This angered the Finnish government who also refused to assist the Wehrmacht in seizing Leningrad. Eventually the tide turned in favor of the Red Army and Soviet troops marched back into Finland and on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 1944, the Red Army got within striking distance of Helsinki. The Finns sued for peace and lost much territory including a large part of Saami.\n\n===[[Lapland War|Lapland War (1944-45)]] ===\nAs a result of Finland's peace deal with the Soviets, German troops were required to leave the country. Finland wished to reconquer the towns under German occupation. As a result, mostly Sa\u00e1mi troops interested in reconquering their homeland.The withdrawal of the German Wehrmacht from Northern Finland and far north of Norway meant that all houses, roads and infrastructure were destroyed. This meant forced evacuation, destruction, an economic setback and the loss of all visible history. The Germans committed many atrocities against the Norwegians and Norwegian Sa\u00e1mi at this time including raping hundreds of women, many of whom committed suicide because of the trauma. The [[Finnmark]] province, the north-eastern municipalities of [[Troms]] province and all of the northern areas of Finland were but smoking ruins. Eventually Soviet Troops fulling invaded Sampi with the asistance of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norweigian Army in Exile]] and liberated Finnish Lappland and Finnmark. On April 26th 1945 [[Liberation of Finnmark|Finnmark was finally liberated.]] \n\n==Renewed interest==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nNews in S\u00e1mi on national radio in Norway started in 1946. At about the same time, experiments were being done with bilingual teachings of the alphabet in the first and second grade, to ease the learning process. However, the presence of a S\u00e1mi minority in Norway was largely ignored. Education, communication, industrialization, all contributed to integrating S\u00e1mi communities into Norwegian society at the point of losing identity.\n\nThe conflicts between S\u00e1mi and the Nordic governments continued into the mid 20th century. The proposed construction of the hydro power dam in the 1960s and 1970s contained [[Alta controversy|controversial]] propositions such as putting a village ([[M\u00e1ze]]) and a cemetery under water.\n\nOnly a minor part is today working with reindeer husbandry. There are also minor groups working as fishermen, producing S\u00e1mi arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length in the [[S\u00e1mi parliaments]] (with differing levels of authority and autonomy in various countries) or influence in any [[S\u00e1mi language]], the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of [[Norrland]] (and not only [[S\u00e1mi villages]]) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.\n\nWith the creation of the [[Republic of Finland]] in the first half of the 20th century, the S\u00e1mi inhabiting this area were no longer under the rule of the Russian Empire, but instead citizens of the newly created state of Finland.  The [[S\u00e1mi Parliament of Finland]] was created in 1973.  One recent issue concerning S\u00e1mi rights in Finland is the foresting of traditional S\u00e1mi land by state-owned Finnish companies.\n\nSince 1992, the S\u00e1mi have had their own national day; the February 6.\n\nIn 1898 and 1907/08 some S\u00e1mi emigrated to [[Alaska]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], respectively, due to requests from the American government. Their mission was to teach reindeer herding to Native Americans.

Kainuu S\u00e1mi belonged to the Eastern S\u00e1mi language group. It died out when the Kainuu S\u00e1mi assimilated and was replaced by [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nThe original inhabitants of Kainuu were S\u00e1mi hunter-fisherers. In the 17th century, the [[Governor General of Finland]] [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] fostered the population growth of Kainuu by giving a ten-year [[tax exemption]] to settlers. It was necessary to populate Kainuu with Finnish farmers because the area was threatened from the east by the Russians.\n\nThere are only 14,600 S\u00e1mi living in Sweden today.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SE | publisher = Ethnologue | title = Languages of Sweden}}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Already the ancient Romans knew about the Phinnoi, the people that hunted with arrowheads made from bone.

The phonology is based regular sound changes that took place in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian from Proto-Algonquian, as well as cues in the colonial orthography regarding pronunciation, as the writing system was based on English pronunciation and spelling conventions in use at the time, keeping in mind differences in late seventeenth century English versus today.  Other resources included information from extant Algonquian languages with native speakers.<ref name=\"Project History\">Baird, J. L. D. (2014). 'Project History.'

It was historically spoken by the Massachusett people of Greater Boston, the Pawtucket of southernmost Maine, coastal [[New Hampshire]] and the lower [[Merrimack River]] watershed, the Wampanoag of southeastern Massachusetts but specifically Cape Cod and the Islands and portions of Rhode Island, the Nauset (possibly a Wampanoag sub-group) of the outer Cape and the Coweset of north-western Rhode Island, and likely spread as a common second language to many Nipmuc and Pennacook speaking groups.  In a simplified Pidgin form, it was a common medium of intertribal communication across most of New England and Long Island.<ref name=\"dialects\">Goddard, Ives. 1996. \"Introduction.\" Ives Goddard, ed., The Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17. Languages, pp. 1\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe historical phonology of the language is hampered by the dormancy of the language with the death of the last speakers at the end of the nineteenth century as well as dialect leveling.  Since the Bible and most of the missionary translations were based on the dialect of the Massachusett people, specifically its Natick variety, that form gained prestige.  The use of Natick as a training center for Indian missionaries and teachers, who were literate and often drawn from Natick's local families, helped spread the prestige of the particular variety, so that most dialectal differences were quickly lost.<ref>Mandell, D. R. (1996). Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts. (p. 59).

The short vowel {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often replaced by {{angbr|u}} in colonial documents.  Given that open front unrounded {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often syncopated, it is likely this allophone approached {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\">Goddard, I. (1981). p. 69.</ref>  Dialectal variation aside, it is likely that {{IPA|/a/}} may have also backed to {{IPA|[\u0251]}} in some environments.<ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\"/>\n\nThe long vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} was often written with {{angbr|i}} in colonial documents before {{IPA|/sk/}} or {{IPA|/\u0283k/}}, indicating it may have shortened to {{IPA|[i]}} in these environments.  A similar process also occurs in Abenakian languages. In the development of Massachusett, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} weakens to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}, which triggers k-palatization and vowel affection in certain environments.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>\n\nThe long vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} is written in a myriad of ways, which may just be the difficulty in rendering the vowel according to English spelling rules as used in the colonial orthography. It is likely that most instances were generally {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, but it most likely backed {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>\n\nThe long, nasal vowel {{IPA|/\u00e3/}} (possibly better represented by {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0/}} to indicate length in addition to nasality) may also frequently approach the mid-open nasal {{IPA|[\u0254\u0303\u02d0]}}.  Before {{IPA|/h/}}, colonial writers used {{angbr|u}}, possibly indicating an allophone {{IPA|[\u0259\u0303\u02d0]}} before {{IPA|/h/}}.  The colonial orthography assigns vowels with a circumflex to write them, but this was not done consistently. A silent {{angbr|m}} (before {{IPA|/p/}}) and {{angbr|n}} (elsewhere) was often used to indicate nasality, but writers often confused usage of the circumflex, to mark nasality, and the acute accent, to mark stress and length.<ref>Goddard, I. (1981). p. 70.</ref> \n  \nThe long vowel {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, represented in the colonial orthography by {{angbr|\ua74f}} or {{angbr|oo}} and {{angbr|8}} in the modern one, was often written with {{angbr|o}} in the earliest colonial writings, suggesting a change from a mid-back vowel or close-mid vowel {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} to a close-back {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}, which can be reconstructed from development.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>  For example, 'snake' is ''ask\ua74fk'' (''ask8k'') {{IPA|/asku\u02d0k/}} and descends from Proto-Algonquian *''a\u03b8ko\u00b7ka'' and Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''axko\u00b7k''.<ref>Based on regular patterns of sound change from Proto-Algonquian.

[[Approximant]]\n|{{IPA|w}}\n|\n|{{IPA|j}}\n|\n|\n|}\n\nMassachusett has thirteen consonant phonemes, not including possible allophones. They are divided into the [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; [[stop consonants|stop]] {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/, /k\u02b7/}} and the voiceless [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] stop {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}}; the voiceless affricates {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} and the voiced continuants, which comprises the voiced nasal {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and the voiced approximants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}. The stop consonants were particularly difficult for early English missionaries to record with the Latin alphabet because Massachusett did not make phonemic distinctions of voicing with these consonants, and these consonants likely had voiced allophones of {{IPA|[b, d, \u0261, \u0261\u02b7, d\u02b2]}}, dependent upon word environment, dialect, or speaker. In addition, Massachusett consonants probably lacked distinctions based on [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] for these consonants. In English, the equivalent stop consonants are aspirated in stressed and in final positions, but not in consonant clusters after {{IPA|/s/}} (for example, English ''spin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}} while ''pin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}}).<ref>Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical Features of Massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs'' [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 227\u2013244). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.</ref>\n\nAs a result of these differing phonologies, the colonial orthography can be separated into unvoiced/voiced pairs that do not change meaning, such as {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}/{{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}}/{{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|q[u]}}/{{angbr|g[w]}}, {{angbr|s}}/{{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|d}}/{{angbr|t}}, which correspond to {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|t}}, respectively, in the modern orthography.<ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\">Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 9.</ref>  Eliot and the other colonial missionaries often switched between the unvoiced-voiced pairs, and it is possible that the consonants themselves had allophones dependent on word position and dialect.<ref>Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K. (1988). Native writings in Massachusetts. In Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society (185 ed. Part II, pp. 276-279). Philadelphia, PA: American Philosophical Society.</ref><ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\"/>\n\nThe phonetic value of {{IPA|/s/}} in clusters probably approached {{IPA|[s\u032a]}}, given the alteration of {{IPA|/hs/}} and {{IPA|/h\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/sk/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283k/}} in representation in the colonial orthography. As {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} had merged in Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, restoration of {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in consonants, especially in clusters with {{IPA|/h/}}, indicates that the allophone of {{IPA|/s/}} in these environments was generally {{IPA|[s\u032a]}}, which sounds closer to {{IPA|/\u0283/}}{{dubious|the diacritic used here is a dental one. Is it supposed to be retracted?|date=September 2018}} and generally represented by {{angbr|sh}} in the WLRP new orthography.<ref>Goddard, I. (1981). pp. 59-68.</ref>\n\nAs a result of borrowings, English-language religious, technical, agricultural, legal, societal, cultural, and governmental terminology was adopted by the Indians. Foreign sounds, or recognition of the preferred allophone, led to the adoption of {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /f/, /\u0261/, /d\u0292/, /\u0292/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} as phonemes in these English loanwords. However, it is likely that only bilingual speakers or those exposed to English speakers pronounced these words more akin to their English values, whereas monolingual Massachusett speakers and those further from English contact would have likely used native approximantions. For example, colonial-era documents include both preserved ''Frenchmenog'' (possibly {{IPA|[fr\u025bnt\u0283m\u0259nak]}}) vs. nativized ''panachmanog'' (possibly {{IPA|[p\u0259n\u00e3t\u0283m\u0259nak]}}). In addition, anecdotal evidence from accounts of English colonists indicate that the Massachusett or related N-dialect speakers had trouble with English {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, even though they existed in related languages, since they pronounced English words ''sleep'' and ''lobster'' as ''sneep'' and ''nobstah''.  However, final {{IPA|/r/}} goes unnoticed as English in New England developed non-rhotically.\n\nAlthough the revived dialect of the Wampanoag continues to use some loan words from English (such as ''p\u00e2yum-'', {{IPA|/pa\u02d0j\u0259m/}} from English ''pay''), most borrowings are eschewed for native equivalents, neologisms coined from known Massachusett radicals and adoption of terms from cognate, extant Algonquian languages since the new speakers of the language are all bilingual or more proficient in English.<ref>Hicks, N. (2006). p. 80.</ref> For example, the colonial-era Indians adopted the English calendrical system, and adopted all the terms for units of time and names for the days and months. Thus, '[[Thursday]]' and as well as its alternate Early Modern English form ''Y<sup>ur\u017fday</sup>'' existed along the lesser-used Massachusett coinage ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' (''n\u00f4panatahshuquneehsh\u00f4k'') {{IPA|/n\u00e3panatah\u0283\u0259k\u02b7\u0259ni\u02d0h\u0283\u00e3k/}}, which can be translated as 'that which goes five days long' (after the [original] Sabbath).<ref>Cf. Portuguese ''quinta-feira'', 'fifth day' or 'Thursday.'</ref>  However, ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' is created from Massachusett radicals by the Indians, even if it referred to a Western cultural introduction.<ref>Cotton, J.

Clusters also tend to occur at the end of a root word before a following suffix, often restoring etymological {{IPA|/\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/\u02b2/}}{{clarify|what is etymological {{IPA|/\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/\u02b2/}}? Labialization and palatalization?|date=September 2018}} or even entire syllables, which were dropped at the end of consonants as early as Proto-Eastern Algonquian, but are common enough that they have to be learned. For example, ''annum'' (''anum'', 'dog,') but ''ann\u00famm'''w'''ag'' (''anum'''w'''ak'', {{IPA|/an\u0259mwak/}}, 'dogs')<ref>Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 13.</ref>  Also, additional morphemes attached to the root word often begin with consonants themselves, thus increasing their likelihood at these junctures.\n\nMassachusett uses {{IPA|/hk/, /hk\u02b7/, /hp/, /hpw/, /hs/, /hsw/, /h\u0283/, /h\u0283w/, /ht\u02b2/, /ht\u0283/, /htw/, /hw/, /mw/, /nw/, /pw/, /sk/, /sk\u02b7/, /sp/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283k/}}.<ref>Fermino, J. L. D. (2000).</ref><ref>Hicks, N. (2006).</ref> In the rare dialects that permitted syncopation, combinations such as {{IPA|/ksk\u02b7/, /ths/, /sk\u02b7/, /ks/, /k\u02b7s/, /sk\u02b7h/}} and {{IPA|/m\u0283/}} have been recorded in the literature, although some examples from translations of the [[Book of Psalms]] that were intended to be sung were forcibly altered to fit the meter of the music.  The Massachusett word, ''wussuhquohhonk'' (''wusuhqah\u00f4k'' {{IPA|/w\u0259s\u0259hk\u02b7ah\u0254\u0303k/}}, 'writing' or 'book') was altered to ''wussukwhonk'' (*''wusuhqh\u00f4k'' {{IPA|/w\u0259s\u0259hk\u02b7h\u00e3k/}}),<ref>Hicks, N.

'pp. 97-99.</ref>\n\n==Prosody==\nStress in the language is unknown, but Massachusett likely had a stress system similar to extant languages, such as Ojibwe, Algonquin, M'ikmaq, Munsee and Unami.<ref>Randolph, V. J.  (2001). ''Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar''. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press.</ref> In Ojibwe, the rule is as follows: A metrical foot consists of two syllables, ideally with the stress on the second syllable.  All long vowels are stressed, and when they occur in the weaker syllable of a metrical foot, the syllable that contains them is counted as its own foot and counting begins on the next syllable pair, and the last syllable is always stressed.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, B. (1995). ''Metrical Stress Theory: Principles and Case Studies.'' (pp. 215-227). Urbana-Champagne, IL: University of Illinois Press.</ref>\n\nIn M'ikmaq, Unami and Munsee, languages that are more closely related to Massachusett, the rules are a little more complex. In these languages, metrical feet consist of two syllables or [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], forming either strong right-foot iambs or strong left-foot trochees. Primary stress generally falls on either the rightmost (iambic) or leftmost (trochaic) syllables, but there are numerous exceptions. Unlike the Ojibwe system, these Eastern Algonquian languages allow for word-final unstressed syllables. Long vowels tend to be stressed, but may be shortened when long vowels fall in the weaker position. Long vowels and short syllables in the strong part of the foot receive secondary stress.  Stressed words, especially the primary stress, are pronounced louder and at a higher pitch, with secondary stress the effects less so.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/>  Because Massachusett, generally, does not undergo vowel syncope, weak vowels can receive secondary stress and entire words can consist of weak, short vowel syllables as in Mi'kmaq and Unami.<ref>Olson, E.

Palatization is also triggered when {{IPA|/k/}} is followed by {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, which derives from PEA *''\u0113'', and {{IPA|/\u0259w/}}, which remains unchanged from PEA *''\u0259w''.  The palatization of {{IPA|/k/}} followed by {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is common, but in Massachusett, {{IPA|/k/}} is often restored before {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259w/}} by analogy to prevent excessive alteration of forms.<ref name=\"G230\">Goddard, I.

believed to have been spoken circa 5000 BC in what is now the [[Northwest Plateau]] region, such as the inland regions of the [[Pacific Northwest]] along the Columbia River separated from the coast by rugged mountains.  Movements of people and competition for resources, shifts to other languages that developed or arrived in the region pushed the Algic languages out of their original homeland.  The only known non-Algonquian Algic languages are Yurokan and Wiyotan, known only from the current languages [[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]], which despite sharing cultural similarities and inhabiting adjacent areas of the northernmost coastal area of California, their languages are relics of a historically more widespread group of languages which diverged in the very distant past.<ref>Cambell, L. (1997). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. In (pp. 151-153). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Goddard, Ives (1994). 'The West-to-East Cline in Algonquian Dialectology'. In Cowan, William. ''Actes du Vingt-Cinqui\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s des Algonquinistes''. Ottawa, ON: Carleton University. pp. 187\u2013211.</ref>\n\nFrom an unknown Algic ancestor, Proto-Algonquian emerged sometime around 1000 BC, posited to have been spoken anywhere from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains of Montana or an area just west of the Great Lakes.  The Algonquian languages spread, covering southern Canada and the northern half of the United States from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.  Around 1000 AD, Proto-Eastern Algonquian emerged, probably somewhere in southern Ontario about the Great Lakes region, and spread from the Maritimes to the Carolinas and separated by speakers of Iroquoian languages.  The Eastern languages, which are the only genetic grouping to have emerged from Algonquian, can be further differentiated.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (2005). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. (pp. 93-95, 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\nProto-Eastern Algonquian had a daughter language, Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, which is the ancestor of all the languages of southern New England and most of Long Island.  This includes related languages such as Nipmuc, Mohegan-Pequot, Niantic, Narragansett and Quiripi-Naugatuck.  The timeline for the development of PSNEA is unclear, but it might be linked to the local adoption of corn, beans and squash agriculture slowly introduced from the south.  When Massachusett emerged as a spoken language is unclear, but by the 1400s, cultural practices and peoples would probably be recognizable to the Pilgrims and Puritans that encountered their descendants two centuries later.<ref>Bragdon, K. (1999). pp. 92-95.</ref>\n\n===Consonant development===\nThe most striking feature in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian was the collapse of PA *''\u03b8'' and *''l'' into PEA *''r''.  As a result, reconstructed PA *''a\u03b8emwa'' ('dog') and *''*e\u00b7likwa'' ('ant') become PEA *''ar\u0259m'' and *''e\u00b7ri\u00b7kw'', respectively. This is in contrast to Arapaho ''he\u03b8'' (''he3'', 'dog'), which preserves PA *''\u03b8'' and the 'Illu' dialects of western [[Innu language|Montagnais]] (Innu) ''eylig'' and the 'Irru' dialect of the [[Atikamekw language|Atikamekw]] ''eyrig'' (since PA *''l'' was most likely realized as {{IPA|[r]}} in most Algonquian languages, or a fricative {{IPAblink|\u026c}} that was somewhere between {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} and {{IPA|[l]}}). Note that PSNEA inherited *''ar\u0259m'' unaltered, but either reduplication or an unknown prefix, PA *''e\u00b7ri\u00b7kw'' yields Massachusett ''anuneks'' or ''annuncks'' (possibly *{{IPA|/a\u02d0[n\u0259]n\u0259kw[ee]s/}} with diminutive suffix) instead of expected PSNEA *''a\u00b7n\u0259kw''.\n\nIn consonant clusters, however, PA *''\u03b8'' and *''l'' behave very differently. Proto-Algonquian *C''\u03b8'' generally yields *C''x'', save PA *''n\u03b8'' which develops into PEA *''hr''.  In clusters of PA *''\u03b8''C, most merge into PEA *''s''C with the exception of PA *''\u03b8p'' which is realized as PEA *''\u0161p''.  Very few PA clusters of *C''l'' are permitted.  The development of PA *''\u02c0l'' to PEA *''hr'' is expected, but PA *''hl'' falls into PEA *''hx'' and PA *''nl'' is even more erratic.  Under normal development, *''nl'' would yield PEA *''hr'', but it morphs into *''h'' in transitive inanimate singular imperatives.  Furthermore, PA *''\u02c0l'', *''nl'' and *''n\u03b8'' > PEA *''hr'', *''PA *''hl'', *''h\u03b8'' and *''\u02c0\u03b8'' > PEA *hx''.\n\nOther general mergers include the collapse of PA *''h''C and *''\u02c0''C into PEA *''h''C.  For example, PA *''ht'' and *''\u02c0t'' > PEA **''ht'' and PA *''ht'', PA *''hp'' and *''\u02c0p'' > PEA **''hp'' and *''h\u010d'' and *''\u02c0\u010d'' > PEA **''h\u010d''.   With the exception of *''nl'' and *''n\u03b8'', all instances of PA *''n''C are retained in PEA.  Proto-Algonquian *''\u00e7'' develops into *''r'' in PEA even in clusters.  PA *''\u010d'' before *''p'' and *''k'' altered to PEA *''\u0161'' and *''s'', respectively.  Also, PA *''x'' and *''s'' merge into PEA *''s''.  Proto-Eastern Algonquian also prefers to drop PA *''w'' and *''y'' after consonants and clusters in PEA, but these are often restored by analogy when there are inflectional endings.  For example, PA *''ma\u03b8kwa'' > PEA *''maxk'' > PSNEA *''mask'' > Massachusett ''mosk'' (''masq'') {{IPA|/mask/}}, but Massachusett ''mosgq<u>u</u>ak'' (''masqash'') {{IPA|/mask<u>\u02b7</u>ash/}}.\n\nIn the development of Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, several notable developments take place, especially in regards to PEA *''r''.  In PEA, all instances of *''r'' that descend from PA *''\u00e7'' must have been unstable or had a unique treatment in PEA as they all shifted to PSNEA *''s'', e.g., PA *''\u00e7'' > PEA *''r'' > PSNEA *''s'', PA *''\u00e7k'' > PEA *''rk'' > PSNEA *''sk'' and PA *''\u00e7p'' > PEA *''rp'' > PSNEA *''sp''.  Clusters from PEA with *''r'' also show the same instability.  Whereas PEA *''r'' yields PSNEA *''r'', in final positions, it becomes PSNEA *''\u0161'', most noticeable in treatments of inanimate plurals.  For example, PA *''me\u00e7kw-'' > PEA *''m\u0259rkw-'' > PSNEA *''m\u0259skw-'' > Massachusett ''musqu'' (''mushq-''), 'red.'  But also PA *''meh\u03b8o\u00b7\u03b8\u0161i'' > PEA *''m\u0259hxo\u00b7r'' > PSNEA *''m\u0259h\u0161o\u00b7r'' > Massachusett ''mishoon'' (''muhsh8n'') {{IPA|/m\u0259h\u0283u\u02d0n/}}.\n\nIn a similar vein, PEA *''hr'', *''h\u0161'' and *''hx'' all merge into PSNEA *''h\u0161''.  As a result of these mergers, the sound of {{IPA|/\u0283/}} was preserved in PSNEA, since PEA *''s'' and *''\u0161'' merge in PSNEA as *''s''.  Even PEA *''n\u0161'' and *''\u0161p'' yield PSNEA *''s'' and *''sp'', respectively.  For example, PA *''le\u00b7hle-'' > PEA *''re\u00b7hxe-'' > PSNEA *''ra\u00b7h\u0161'' > Massachusett ''n\u00e1hsh-'' (''n\u00e2hsh-'') {{IPA|/na\u02d0h\u0283/}}<ref>Hicks, N. (2006). p. 21.</ref> and PEA *''wi\u00b7nkwe\u00b7hre\u00b7w'' > PSNEA *''wi\u00b7kwah\u0161'' > Massachusett ''w\u00e9gquosh'' (''weeqahsh'') {{IPA|/wi\u02d0k\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283/}}<ref>Costa. D. J. (2007). p. 37. Based on reconstruction from PEA *''wi\u00b7nkwe\u00b7hre\u00b7w'' ('swan')</ref>\n\nA major development is the palatization of PEA *''k''.  As described in other sections, this causes a shift to PSNEA *''ty'' in restrictive environments.  For example, PA *''kakakiwa'' > PEA *''kakakiw'' > PSNEA *''k\u0105k\u0105nty\u0259w'' > Massachusett ''k\u00f4kontu'' (''k\u00f4k\u00f4tyuw'') {{IPA|/k\u00e3k\u00e3t\u02b2\u0259w/}}, 'crow.'  Furthermore, PEA *''sk'' undergoes palatization to PSNEA *''h\u010d''.  For example, PA *''niswine\u03b8ke\u00b7k'' > PEA *''ni\u00b7sin\u01ddxke\u00b7k'' (northern PEA *''ni\u00b7sin\u01dd\u0161ke\u00b7k'' and possibly even *''ni\u00b7sin\u01ddske\u00b7k'' in New England PEA) > PSNEA *''ni\u00b7s\u01ddn\u01ddh\u010da\u00b7k'' > Massachusett ''nesnehchag'' (''neesnuhch\u00e2k'') {{IPA|/ni\u02d0sn\u0259ht\u0283a\u02d0k/}}, 'twenty' (literally 'two [pairs of] hands'). Otherwise, the typical development of PA *''\u03b8k'' is PSNEA *''sk''.\n\nIn the development of Massachusett from PSNEA, a few noticeable differences arise.  Mainly, PSNEA *''r'' is {{IPA|/n/}} in Massachusett dialects, but within the SNEA languages, there are varieties that have replaced PSNEA *''r'' with {{IPA|/l/}} (Nipmuc), {{IPA|/j/}} (Niantic), {{IPA|/n/}} (some Narragansett dialects) or retained historical {{IPA|/r/}} (Quiripi).  For instance, PSNEA *''ar\u0259m'' ('dog') was Massachusett ''anum'', Narragansett ''ayimp'', Nipmuc ''alum'', and Quiripi ''arum''.  Massachusett preserves final PEA *''r'' as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and the general merger of PSNEA merger of *''s'' and *''\u0161'', but {{IPA|[\u0283]}} re-appears as an allophone of {{IPA|/s/}}, probably due to the influence of emerging {{IPA|/h\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in other environments, but the alteration may have varied by dialect or perhaps imparted some unknown semantic meaning.\n\nThe instability of PA *''nl'' is also preserved.  While it tends to follow that it evolves into PEA *''hr'' and then it should yield PSNEA *''h\u0161'', however, it seems to have, in certain words, evolved into PEA *''r'' or *''h'', especially in transitive inanimate second person imperative verbs but appears in Massachusett as {{IPA|/n/, /s/}} or {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (and not {{IPA|/h\u0283/}}), however, words in this category seem to have been altered by analogy to other words, such as PA *''no\u00b7nle\u00b7waki'' > PEA *''no\u00b7hre\u00b7wak'' > PSNEA *''no\u00b7ra\u00b7wak'' > Massachusett ''n\ua74fn\u00e1og'' (''n8n\u00e2wak'' {{IPA|/nu\u02d0na\u02d0wak/}}, 'she suckles them' or 'she nurses them') or appears as {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\n===Vowel development===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+ Vowel development from Proto-Algonquian<ref name=\"Goddard\"/><ref name=\"Goddard2\"/>\n|-----bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PA \n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PEA\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PSNEA\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | ''Mass.''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''i''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| *''i\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| *''i\u00b7'', *''\u0259''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\n|- \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''i\u00b7''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''e''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | *''\u0259''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\n|- \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\"| *''e\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''a\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | *''a''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/a/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | *''a\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''\u0105''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''o'' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | *''o\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''o\u00b7''\n|}\n\nThe vowels of Proto-Algonquian were very symmetric, comprising short vowels *''a'', *''e'', *''i'' and *''o'' followed by their long counterparts *''a\u00b7'', *''e\u00b7'', *''i\u00b7'' and *''o\u00b7''.  These remained relatively intact in some of the Central Algonquian languages, but were radically restructured in most of the Plains Algonquian languages and Eastern Algonquian languages.\n\nBoth PA *''i'' and *''o'' are lost and merge into their long counterparts in PEA, e.g., PA *''i'' and *''i\u00b7'' > PEA *''i\u00b7'' and PA *''o'' and *''o\u00b7'' > PEA *''o\u00b7''.  Proto-Algonquian *''e'' alters to PEA *''\u0259'' but PA *''a'', *''a\u00b7'' and *''e\u00b7'' remain unchanged.  This left PEA Algonquian with two short vowels *''a'' and *''\u0259'' and four long vowels *''a\u00b7'', *''e\u00b7'', *''i\u00b7'' and  *''o\u00b7''.\n\nProto-Southern New England Algonquian kept the PEA vowels *''a'', *''\u0259'' and *''o\u00b7'' unaltered. Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''e\u00b7'' shifted to PSNEA *''a\u00b7''. However, PEA *''a\u00b7'' was lost, instead it was altered to the PSNEA nasal vowel *''\u0105''.  Although this appears to be diagnostic of the SNEA languages, the intrusive nasal is possibly a feature shared with Algonquian. The PEA long vowel *''i\u00b7'' underwent some alteration. When not in the initial syllable of a word, and probably in an unstressed position often shortened to PSNEA *''\u0259'', a process that may also trigger vowel affection and {{IPA|/k/}} palatization.\n\nThe vowel inventory of PSNEA *''a'', *''a\u00b7'', *''\u0105'', *''\u0259'', *''i\u00b7'' (which are equivalent to their Massachusett phonological representation {{IPA|/a/, /a\u02d0/, /\u00e3/, /\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, respectively) is retained, but PSNEA *''o\u00b7'' becomes *''u\u02d0'' or {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. This is reflected by the double-o ligature {{angbr|\ua74f}} or the digraph {{angbr|oo}} in the colonial-era documents and {{angbr|8}} in the modern orthography implemented by the WLRP.<ref>Eliot, J. (1832). The Indian Grammar Begun. Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, IX(2), 243-312.</ref><ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\"/> Eliot claimed that the double o ligature was pronounced like English ''book'' and ''mood'', both of which were also pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} before shifting to {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, but the word ''book'' was probably still pronounced closer to {{IPA|[bu\u02d0k]}} than current {{IPA|[b\u028ak]}} in Eliot's time, as the effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English were still going on, and may reflect Eliot's use of {{angbr|o}} in his earliest Massachusett writings, whereas the majority use {{angbr|\ua74f}}.<ref>Lass, Roger (2000). \"Chapter 3: Phonology and Morphology\". In Lass, Roger. The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776. Cambridge University Press. pp. 56\u2013186.</ref> Eliot also used {{angbr|\ua74f}} for what has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/\u0259w/}}, especially word-medial or word-final positions, and {{IPA|/w\u0259/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}} word initially. However, in the modern orthography, {{angbr|8}} is only used for what can be traced back to developments from Proto-Algonquian *''o\u00b7''.\n\n===Development examples===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Development from Proto-Algonquian\n|-----bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n!

The phonology is based regular sound changes that took place in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian from Proto-Algonquian, as well as cues in the colonial orthography regarding pronunciation, as the writing system was based on English pronunciation and spelling conventions in use at the time, keeping in mind differences in late seventeenth century English versus today.

It was historically spoken by the Massachusett people of Greater Boston, the Pawtucket of southernmost Maine, coastal [[New Hampshire]] and the lower [[Merrimack River]] watershed, the Wampanoag of southeastern Massachusetts but specifically Cape Cod and the Islands and portions of Rhode Island, the Nauset (possibly a Wampanoag sub-group) of the outer Cape and the Coweset of north-western Rhode Island, and likely spread as a common second language to many Nipmuc and Pennacook speaking groups.  In a simplified Pidgin form, it was a common medium of intertribal communication across most of New England and Long Island.<ref name=\"dialects\">Goddard, Ives. 1996. \"Introduction.\" Ives Goddard, ed., The Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17. Languages, pp. 1\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe historical phonology of the language is hampered by the dormancy of the language with the death of the last speakers at the end of the nineteenth century as well as dialect leveling.  Since the Bible and most of the missionary translations were based on the dialect of the Massachusett people, specifically its Natick variety, that form gained prestige.  The use of Natick as a training center for Indian missionaries and teachers, who were literate and often drawn from Natick's local families, helped spread the prestige of the particular variety, so that most dialectal differences were quickly lost.<ref>Mandell, D.

The short vowel {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often replaced by {{angbr|u}} in colonial documents.  Given that open front unrounded {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often syncopated, it is likely this allophone approached {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\">Goddard, I. (1981). p. 69.</ref>  Dialectal variation aside, it is likely that {{IPA|/a/}} may have also backed to {{IPA|[\u0251]}} in some environments.<ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\"/>\n\nThe long vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} was often written with {{angbr|i}} in colonial documents before {{IPA|/sk/}} or {{IPA|/\u0283k/}}, indicating it may have shortened to {{IPA|[i]}} in these environments.  A similar process also occurs in Abenakian languages. In the development of Massachusett, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} weakens to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}, which triggers k-palatization and vowel affection in certain environments.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>\n\nThe long vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} is written in a myriad of ways, which may just be the difficulty in rendering the vowel according to English spelling rules as used in the colonial orthography. It is likely that most instances were generally {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, but it most likely backed {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>\n\nThe long, nasal vowel {{IPA|/\u00e3/}} (possibly better represented by {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0/}} to indicate length in addition to nasality) may also frequently approach the mid-open nasal {{IPA|[\u0254\u0303\u02d0]}}.  Before {{IPA|/h/}}, colonial writers used {{angbr|u}}, possibly indicating an allophone {{IPA|[\u0259\u0303\u02d0]}} before {{IPA|/h/}}.  The colonial orthography assigns vowels with a circumflex to write them, but this was not done consistently. A silent {{angbr|m}} (before {{IPA|/p/}}) and {{angbr|n}} (elsewhere) was often used to indicate nasality, but writers often confused usage of the circumflex, to mark nasality, and the acute accent, to mark stress and length.<ref>Goddard, I. (1981). p. 70.</ref> \n  \nThe long vowel {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, represented in the colonial orthography by {{angbr|\ua74f}} or {{angbr|oo}} and {{angbr|8}} in the modern one, was often written with {{angbr|o}} in the earliest colonial writings, suggesting a change from a mid-back vowel or close-mid vowel {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} to a close-back {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}, which can be reconstructed from development.<ref name=\"soixante-neuf\"/>  For example, 'snake' is ''ask\ua74fk'' (''ask8k'') {{IPA|/asku\u02d0k/}} and descends from Proto-Algonquian *''a\u03b8ko\u00b7ka'' and Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''axko\u00b7k''.<ref>Based on regular patterns of sound change from Proto-Algonquian.

[[Approximant]]\n|{{IPA|w}}\n|\n|{{IPA|j}}\n|\n|\n|}\n\nMassachusett has thirteen consonant phonemes, not including possible allophones. They are divided into the [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; [[stop consonants|stop]] {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/, /k\u02b7/}} and the voiceless [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] stop {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}}; the voiceless affricates {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} and the voiced continuants, which comprises the voiced nasal {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and the voiced approximants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}. The stop consonants were particularly difficult for early English missionaries to record with the Latin alphabet because Massachusett did not make phonemic distinctions of voicing with these consonants, and these consonants likely had voiced allophones of {{IPA|[b, d, \u0261, \u0261\u02b7, d\u02b2]}}, dependent upon word environment, dialect, or speaker. In addition, Massachusett consonants probably lacked distinctions based on [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] for these consonants. In English, the equivalent stop consonants are aspirated in stressed and in final positions, but not in consonant clusters after {{IPA|/s/}} (for example, English ''spin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}} while ''pin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}}).<ref>Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical Features of Massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs'' [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 227\u2013244). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.</ref>\n\nAs a result of these differing phonologies, the colonial orthography can be separated into unvoiced/voiced pairs that do not change meaning, such as {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}/{{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}}/{{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|q[u]}}/{{angbr|g[w]}}, {{angbr|s}}/{{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|d}}/{{angbr|t}}, which correspond to {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|t}}, respectively, in the modern orthography.<ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\">Fermino, J. L. D.

Philadelphia, PA: American Philosophical Society.</ref><ref name=\"Fermino, J. L.

As {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} had merged in Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, restoration of {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in consonants, especially in clusters with {{IPA|/h/}}, indicates that the allophone of {{IPA|/s/}} in these environments was generally {{IPA|[s\u032a]}}, which sounds closer to {{IPA|/\u0283/}}{{dubious|the diacritic used here is a dental one. Is it supposed to be retracted?|date=September 2018}} and generally represented by {{angbr|sh}} in the WLRP new orthography.<ref>Goddard, I. (1981). pp. 59-68.</ref>\n\nAs a result of borrowings, English-language religious, technical, agricultural, legal, societal, cultural, and governmental terminology was adopted by the Indians. Foreign sounds, or recognition of the preferred allophone, led to the adoption of {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /f/, /\u0261/, /d\u0292/, /\u0292/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} as phonemes in these English loanwords. However, it is likely that only bilingual speakers or those exposed to English speakers pronounced these words more akin to their English values, whereas monolingual Massachusett speakers and those further from English contact would have likely used native approximantions. For example, colonial-era documents include both preserved ''Frenchmenog'' (possibly {{IPA|[fr\u025bnt\u0283m\u0259nak]}}) vs. nativized ''panachmanog'' (possibly {{IPA|[p\u0259n\u00e3t\u0283m\u0259nak]}}). In addition, anecdotal evidence from accounts of English colonists indicate that the Massachusett or related N-dialect speakers had trouble with English {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, even though they existed in related languages, since they pronounced English words ''sleep'' and ''lobster'' as ''sneep'' and ''nobstah''.  However, final {{IPA|/r/}} goes unnoticed as English in New England developed non-rhotically.\n\nAlthough the revived dialect of the Wampanoag continues to use some loan words from English (such as ''p\u00e2yum-'', {{IPA|/pa\u02d0j\u0259m/}} from English ''pay''), most borrowings are eschewed for native equivalents, neologisms coined from known Massachusett radicals and adoption of terms from cognate, extant Algonquian languages since the new speakers of the language are all bilingual or more proficient in English.<ref>Hicks, N. (2006). p. 80.</ref> For example, the colonial-era Indians adopted the English calendrical system, and adopted all the terms for units of time and names for the days and months. Thus, '[[Thursday]]' and as well as its alternate Early Modern English form ''Y<sup>ur\u017fday</sup>'' existed along the lesser-used Massachusett coinage ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' (''n\u00f4panatahshuquneehsh\u00f4k'') {{IPA|/n\u00e3panatah\u0283\u0259k\u02b7\u0259ni\u02d0h\u0283\u00e3k/}}, which can be translated as 'that which goes five days long' (after the [original] Sabbath).<ref>Cf. Portuguese ''quinta-feira'', 'fifth day' or 'Thursday.'</ref>  However, ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' is created from Massachusett radicals by the Indians, even if it referred to a Western cultural introduction.<ref>Cotton, J.

Clusters also tend to occur at the end of a root word before a following suffix, often restoring etymological {{IPA|/\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/\u02b2/}}{{clarify|what is etymological {{IPA|/\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/\u02b2/}}? Labialization and palatalization?|date=September 2018}} or even entire syllables, which were dropped at the end of consonants as early as Proto-Eastern Algonquian, but are common enough that they have to be learned. For example, ''annum'' (''anum'', 'dog,') but ''ann\u00famm'''w'''ag'' (''anum'''w'''ak'', {{IPA|/an\u0259mwak/}}, 'dogs')<ref>Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 13.</ref>  Also, additional morphemes attached to the root word often begin with consonants themselves, thus increasing their likelihood at these junctures.\n\nMassachusett uses {{IPA|/hk/, /hk\u02b7/, /hp/, /hpw/, /hs/, /hsw/, /h\u0283/, /h\u0283w/, /ht\u02b2/, /ht\u0283/, /htw/, /hw/, /mw/, /nw/, /pw/, /sk/, /sk\u02b7/, /sp/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283k/}}.<ref>Fermino, J.

'pp. 97-99.</ref>\n\n==Prosody==\nStress in the language is unknown, but Massachusett likely had a stress system similar to extant languages, such as Ojibwe, Algonquin, M'ikmaq, Munsee and Unami.<ref>Randolph, V. J.  (2001). ''Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar''. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press.</ref> In Ojibwe, the rule is as follows: A metrical foot consists of two syllables, ideally with the stress on the second syllable.  All long vowels are stressed, and when they occur in the weaker syllable of a metrical foot, the syllable that contains them is counted as its own foot and counting begins on the next syllable pair, and the last syllable is always stressed.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, B. (1995). ''Metrical Stress Theory: Principles and Case Studies.'' (pp. 215-227). Urbana-Champagne, IL: University of Illinois Press.</ref>\n\nIn M'ikmaq, Unami and Munsee, languages that are more closely related to Massachusett, the rules are a little more complex. In these languages, metrical feet consist of two syllables or [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], forming either strong right-foot iambs or strong left-foot trochees. Primary stress generally falls on either the rightmost (iambic) or leftmost (trochaic) syllables, but there are numerous exceptions. Unlike the Ojibwe system, these Eastern Algonquian languages allow for word-final unstressed syllables. Long vowels tend to be stressed, but may be shortened when long vowels fall in the weaker position. Long vowels and short syllables in the strong part of the foot receive secondary stress.  Stressed words, especially the primary stress, are pronounced louder and at a higher pitch, with secondary stress the effects less so.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/>  Because Massachusett, generally, does not undergo vowel syncope, weak vowels can receive secondary stress and entire words can consist of weak, short vowel syllables as in Mi'kmaq and Unami.<ref>Olson, E.

believed to have been spoken circa 5000 BC in what is now the [[Northwest Plateau]] region, such as the inland regions of the [[Pacific Northwest]] along the Columbia River separated from the coast by rugged mountains.  Movements of people and competition for resources, shifts to other languages that developed or arrived in the region pushed the Algic languages out of their original homeland.  The only known non-Algonquian Algic languages are Yurokan and Wiyotan, known only from the current languages [[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]], which despite sharing cultural similarities and inhabiting adjacent areas of the northernmost coastal area of California, their languages are relics of a historically more widespread group of languages which diverged in the very distant past.<ref>Cambell, L. (1997). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. In (pp. 151-153). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Goddard, Ives (1994). 'The West-to-East Cline in Algonquian Dialectology'. In Cowan, William. ''Actes du Vingt-Cinqui\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s des Algonquinistes''. Ottawa, ON: Carleton University. pp. 187\u2013211.</ref>\n\nFrom an unknown Algic ancestor, Proto-Algonquian emerged sometime around 1000 BC, posited to have been spoken anywhere from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains of Montana or an area just west of the Great Lakes.  The Algonquian languages spread, covering southern Canada and the northern half of the United States from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.  Around 1000 AD, Proto-Eastern Algonquian emerged, probably somewhere in southern Ontario about the Great Lakes region, and spread from the Maritimes to the Carolinas and separated by speakers of Iroquoian languages.  The Eastern languages, which are the only genetic grouping to have emerged from Algonquian, can be further differentiated.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (2005). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. (pp. 93-95, 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\nProto-Eastern Algonquian had a daughter language, Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, which is the ancestor of all the languages of southern New England and most of Long Island.  This includes related languages such as Nipmuc, Mohegan-Pequot, Niantic, Narragansett and Quiripi-Naugatuck.  The timeline for the development of PSNEA is unclear, but it might be linked to the local adoption of corn, beans and squash agriculture slowly introduced from the south.  When Massachusett emerged as a spoken language is unclear, but by the 1400s, cultural practices and peoples would probably be recognizable to the Pilgrims and Puritans that encountered their descendants two centuries later.<ref>Bragdon, K. (1999). pp. 92-95.</ref>\n\n===Consonant development===\nThe most striking feature in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian was the collapse of PA *''\u03b8'' and *''l'' into PEA *''r''.  As a result, reconstructed PA *''a\u03b8emwa'' ('dog') and *''*e\u00b7likwa'' ('ant') become PEA *''ar\u0259m'' and *''e\u00b7ri\u00b7kw'', respectively. This is in contrast to Arapaho ''he\u03b8'' (''he3'', 'dog'), which preserves PA *''\u03b8'' and the 'Illu' dialects of western [[Innu language|Montagnais]] (Innu) ''eylig'' and the 'Irru' dialect of the [[Atikamekw language|Atikamekw]] ''eyrig'' (since PA *''l'' was most likely realized as {{IPA|[r]}} in most Algonquian languages, or a fricative {{IPAblink|\u026c}} that was somewhere between {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} and {{IPA|[l]}}). Note that PSNEA inherited *''ar\u0259m'' unaltered, but either reduplication or an unknown prefix, PA *''e\u00b7ri\u00b7kw'' yields Massachusett ''anuneks'' or ''annuncks'' (possibly *{{IPA|/a\u02d0[n\u0259]n\u0259kw[ee]s/}} with diminutive suffix) instead of expected PSNEA *''a\u00b7n\u0259kw''.\n\nIn consonant clusters, however, PA *''\u03b8'' and *''l'' behave very differently. Proto-Algonquian *C''\u03b8'' generally yields *C''x'', save PA *''n\u03b8'' which develops into PEA *''hr''.  In clusters of PA *''\u03b8''C, most merge into PEA *''s''C with the exception of PA *''\u03b8p'' which is realized as PEA *''\u0161p''.  Very few PA clusters of *C''l'' are permitted.  The development of PA *''\u02c0l'' to PEA *''hr'' is expected, but PA *''hl'' falls into PEA *''hx'' and PA *''nl'' is even more erratic.  Under normal development, *''nl'' would yield PEA *''hr'', but it morphs into *''h'' in transitive inanimate singular imperatives.  Furthermore, PA *''\u02c0l'', *''nl'' and *''n\u03b8'' > PEA *''hr'', *''PA *''hl'', *''h\u03b8'' and *''\u02c0\u03b8'' > PEA *hx''.\n\nOther general mergers include the collapse of PA *''h''C and *''\u02c0''C into PEA *''h''C.  For example, PA *''ht'' and *''\u02c0t'' > PEA **''ht'' and PA *''ht'', PA *''hp'' and *''\u02c0p'' > PEA **''hp'' and *''h\u010d'' and *''\u02c0\u010d'' > PEA **''h\u010d''.   With the exception of *''nl'' and *''n\u03b8'', all instances of PA *''n''C are retained in PEA.  Proto-Algonquian *''\u00e7'' develops into *''r'' in PEA even in clusters.  PA *''\u010d'' before *''p'' and *''k'' altered to PEA *''\u0161'' and *''s'', respectively.  Also, PA *''x'' and *''s'' merge into PEA *''s''.  Proto-Eastern Algonquian also prefers to drop PA *''w'' and *''y'' after consonants and clusters in PEA, but these are often restored by analogy when there are inflectional endings.  For example, PA *''ma\u03b8kwa'' > PEA *''maxk'' > PSNEA *''mask'' > Massachusett ''mosk'' (''masq'') {{IPA|/mask/}}, but Massachusett ''mosgq<u>u</u>ak'' (''masqash'') {{IPA|/mask<u>\u02b7</u>ash/}}.\n\nIn the development of Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, several notable developments take place, especially in regards to PEA *''r''.  In PEA, all instances of *''r'' that descend from PA *''\u00e7'' must have been unstable or had a unique treatment in PEA as they all shifted to PSNEA *''s'', e.g., PA *''\u00e7'' > PEA *''r'' > PSNEA *''s'', PA *''\u00e7k'' > PEA *''rk'' > PSNEA *''sk'' and PA *''\u00e7p'' > PEA *''rp'' > PSNEA *''sp''.  Clusters from PEA with *''r'' also show the same instability.  Whereas PEA *''r'' yields PSNEA *''r'', in final positions, it becomes PSNEA *''\u0161'', most noticeable in treatments of inanimate plurals.  For example, PA *''me\u00e7kw-'' > PEA *''m\u0259rkw-'' > PSNEA *''m\u0259skw-'' > Massachusett ''musqu'' (''mushq-''), 'red.'  But also PA *''meh\u03b8o\u00b7\u03b8\u0161i'' > PEA *''m\u0259hxo\u00b7r'' > PSNEA *''m\u0259h\u0161o\u00b7r'' > Massachusett ''mishoon'' (''muhsh8n'') {{IPA|/m\u0259h\u0283u\u02d0n/}}.\n\nIn a similar vein, PEA *''hr'', *''h\u0161'' and *''hx all merge into PSNEA *''h\u0161''.  As a result of these mergers, the sound of {{IPA|/\u0283/}} was preserved in PSNEA, since PEA *''s'' and *''\u0161'' merge in PSNEA as *''s''.  Even PEA *''n\u0161'' and *''\u0161p'' yield PSNEA *''s'' and *''sp'', respectively.  For example, PA *''le\u00b7hle-'' > PEA *''re\u00b7hxe-'' > PSNEA *''ra\u00b7h\u0161'' > Massachusett ''n\u00e1hsh-'' (''n\u00e2hsh-'') {{IPA|/na\u02d0h\u0283/}}<ref>Hicks, N. (2006). p. 21.</ref> and PEA *''wi\u00b7nkwe\u00b7hre\u00b7w'' > PSNEA *''wi\u00b7kwah\u0161'' > Massachusett ''w\u00e9gquosh'' (''weeqahsh'') {{IPA|/wi\u02d0k\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283/}}<ref>Costa. D. J. (2007). p. 37. Based on reconstruction from PEA *''wi\u00b7nkwe\u00b7hre\u00b7w'' ('swan')</ref>\n\nA major development is the palatization of PEA *''k''.  As described in other sections, this causes a shift to PSNEA *''ty'' in restrictive environments.  For example, PA *''kakakiwa'' > PEA *''kakakiw'' > PSNEA *''k\u0105k\u0105nty\u0259w'' > Massachusett ''k\u00f4kontu'' (''k\u00f4k\u00f4tyuw'') {{IPA|/k\u00e3k\u00e3t\u02b2\u0259w/}}, 'crow.'  Furthermore, PEA *''sk'' undergoes palatization to PSNEA *''h\u010d''.  For example, PA *''niswine\u03b8ke\u00b7k'' > PEA *''ni\u00b7sin\u01ddxke\u00b7k'' (northern PEA *''ni\u00b7sin\u01dd\u0161ke\u00b7k'' and possibly even *''ni\u00b7sin\u01ddske\u00b7k'' in New England PEA) > PSNEA *''ni\u00b7s\u01ddn\u01ddh\u010da\u00b7k'' > Massachusett ''nesnehchag'' (''neesnuhch\u00e2k'') {{IPA|/ni\u02d0sn\u0259ht\u0283a\u02d0k/}}, 'twenty' (literally 'two [pairs of] hands'). Otherwise, the typical development of PA *''\u03b8k'' is PSNEA *''sk''.\n\nIn the development of Massachusett from PSNEA, a few noticeable differences arise.  Mainly, PSNEA *''r'' is {{IPA|/n/}} in Massachusett dialects, but within the SNEA languages, there are varieties that have replaced PSNEA *''r'' with {{IPA|/l/}} (Nipmuc), {{IPA|/j/}} (Niantic), {{IPA|/n/}} (some Narragansett dialects) or retained historical {{IPA|/r/}} (Quiripi).  For instance, PSNEA *''ar\u0259m'' ('dog') was Massachusett ''anum'', Narragansett ''ayimp'', Nipmuc ''alum'', and Quiripi ''arum''.  Massachusett preserves final PEA *''r'' as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and the general merger of PSNEA merger of *''s'' and *''\u0161'', but {{IPA|[\u0283]}} re-appears as an allophone of {{IPA|/s/}}, probably due to the influence of emerging {{IPA|/h\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in other environments, but the alteration may have varied by dialect or perhaps imparted some unknown semantic meaning.\n\nThe instability of PA *''nl'' is also preserved.  While it tends to follow that it evolves into PEA *''hr'' and then it should yield PSNEA *''h\u0161'', however, it seems to have, in certain words, evolved into PEA *''r'' or *''h'', especially in transitive inanimate second person imperative verbs but appears in Massachusett as {{IPA|/n/, /s/}} or {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (and not {{IPA|/h\u0283/}}), however, words in this category seem to have been altered by analogy to other words, such as PA *''no\u00b7nle\u00b7waki'' > PEA *''no\u00b7hre\u00b7wak'' > PSNEA *''no\u00b7ra\u00b7wak'' > Massachusett ''n\ua74fn\u00e1og'' (''n8n\u00e2wak'' {{IPA|/nu\u02d0na\u02d0wak/}}, 'she suckles them' or 'she nurses them') or appears as {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\n===Vowel development===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+ Vowel development from Proto-Algonquian<ref name=\"Goddard\"/><ref name=\"Goddard2\"/>\n|-----bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PA \n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PEA\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | PSNEA\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" style=\"width: 30pt;\" | ''Mass.''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''i''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| *''i\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| *''i\u00b7'', *''\u0259''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\n|- \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''i\u00b7''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''e''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | *''\u0259''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\n|- \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\"| *''e\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''a\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | *''a''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/a/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | *''a\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''\u0105''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''o'' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | *''o\u00b7''\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | *''o\u00b7''\n|}\n\nThe vowels of Proto-Algonquian were very symmetric, comprising short vowels *''a'', *''e'', *''i'' and *''o'' followed by their long counterparts *''a\u00b7'', *''e\u00b7'', *''i\u00b7'' and *''o\u00b7''.  These remained relatively intact in some of the Central Algonquian languages, but were radically restructured in most of the Plains Algonquian languages and Eastern Algonquian languages.\n\nBoth PA *''i'' and *''o'' are lost and merge into their long counterparts in PEA, e.g., PA *''i'' and *''i\u00b7'' > PEA *''i\u00b7'' and PA *''o'' and *''o\u00b7'' > PEA *''o\u00b7''.  Proto-Algonquian *''e'' alters to PEA *''\u0259'' but PA *''a'', *''a\u00b7'' and *''e\u00b7'' remain unchanged.  This left PEA Algonquian with two short vowels *''a'' and *''\u0259'' and four long vowels *''a\u00b7'', *''e\u00b7'', *''i\u00b7'' and  *''o\u00b7''.\n\nProto-Southern New England Algonquian kept the PEA vowels *''a'', *''\u0259'' and *''o\u00b7'' unaltered. Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''e\u00b7'' shifted to PSNEA *''a\u00b7''. However, PEA *''a\u00b7'' was lost, instead it was altered to the PSNEA nasal vowel *''\u0105''.  Although this appears to be diagnostic of the SNEA languages, the intrusive nasal is possibly a feature shared with Algonquian. The PEA long vowel *''i\u00b7'' underwent some alteration. When not in the initial syllable of a word, and probably in an unstressed position often shortened to PSNEA *''\u0259'', a process that may also trigger vowel affection and {{IPA|/k/}} palatization.\n\nThe vowel inventory of PSNEA *''a'', *''a\u00b7'', *''\u0105'', *''\u0259'', *''i\u00b7'' (which are equivalent to their Massachusett phonological representation {{IPA|/a/, /a\u02d0/, /\u00e3/, /\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, respectively) is retained, but PSNEA *''o\u00b7'' becomes *''u\u02d0'' or {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. This is reflected by the double-o ligature {{angbr|\ua74f}} or the digraph {{angbr|oo}} in the colonial-era documents and {{angbr|8}} in the modern orthography implemented by the WLRP.<ref>Eliot, J. (1832). The Indian Grammar Begun. Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, IX(2), 243-312.</ref><ref name=\"Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9\"/> Eliot claimed that the double o ligature was pronounced like English ''book'' and ''mood'', both of which were also pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} before shifting to {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, but the word ''book'' was probably still pronounced closer to {{IPA|[bu\u02d0k]}} than current {{IPA|[b\u028ak]}} in Eliot's time, as the effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English were still going on, and may reflect Eliot's use of {{angbr|o}} in his earliest Massachusett writings, whereas the majority use {{angbr|\ua74f}}.<ref>Lass, Roger (2000). \"Chapter 3: Phonology and Morphology\". In Lass, Roger. The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776. Cambridge University Press. pp. 56\u2013186.</ref> Eliot also used {{angbr|\ua74f}} for what has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/\u0259w/}}, especially word-medial or word-final positions, and {{IPA|/w\u0259/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}} word initially. However, in the modern orthography, {{angbr|8}} is only used for what can be traced back to developments from Proto-Algonquian *''o\u00b7''.\n\n===Development examples===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Development from Proto-Algonquian\n|-----bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n!

The area of Platte Clove known as Devil's Kitchen got its name due to the fact that the region is exceedingly difficult and dangerous for hikers. It runs from the top of the Platte Clove valley down into West Saugerties. The area is known to have a lot of [[timber rattlesnake]]s and [[northern copperhead]]s. The south side is known to have hollow ground where a person can fall through the ground into rock crevices. There are places where one can pull back a conifer branch and find a drop of over 100'.

If built, and if planned objectives are achieved, then the transport cost of getting material and people to space, and across the [[inner Solar System]], will be reduced by several orders of magnitude. SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] is championing a much larger set of long-term Mars settlement objectives, ones that take advantage of these lower transport costs to go far beyond what the SpaceX company will build and that will ultimately involve many more [[economic actor]]s\u2014whether individual, company, or government\u2014to [[emergence|build out]] the settlement over many decades.<ref name=ars20160928/><ref name=sn20161010/>\n\nIn addition to explicit SpaceX plans and concepts for a transportation system and early missions, Musk has personally been a very public exponent of a large systemic vision for building a sustainable human presence on Mars over the very long term<!-- perhaps, expand with Musk's stated rationale for this -->, a vision well beyond what his company or he personally can effect. The growth of such a system over decades cannot be planned in every detail, but is rather a [[complex adaptive system]] that will come about only as others make their own independent choices as to how they might, or might not, connect with the broader \"system\" of an incipient (and later, growing) Mars settlement. Musk sees the new and radically lower-cost transport infrastructure facilitating the buildup of a [[spontaneous order|bottom-up]] [[emergent phenomena|economic order]] of other interested parties\u2014whether companies, individuals, or governments\u2014who will [[innovations|innovate]] and [[supply (economics)|supply]] the [[demand (economics)|demand]] that such a growing venture would occasion.<ref name=ars20160928/><ref name=sn20161010/>\n\nWhile the initial SpaceX Mars settlement would start very small, with an initial group of about a dozen people,<ref name=gw20161023/> with time, Musk hopes that such an outpost would grow into something much larger and become self-sustaining, at least 1 million people. According to Musk,<blockquote>Even at a million people you\u2019re assuming an incredible amount of productivity per person, because you would need to recreate the entire industrial base on Mars. You would need to mine and refine all of these different materials, in a much more difficult environment than Earth. There would be no trees growing. There would be no oxygen or nitrogen that are just there. No oil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Excluding organic growth, if you could take 100 people at a time, you would need 10,000 trips to get to a million people. But you would also need a lot of cargo to support those people. In fact, your cargo to person ratio is going to be quite high. It would probably be 10 cargo trips for every human trip, so more like 100,000 trips.

If built, and if planned objectives are achieved, then the transport cost of getting material and people to space, and across the [[inner Solar System]], will be reduced by several orders of magnitude. SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] is championing a much larger set of long-term Mars settlement objectives, ones that take advantage of these lower transport costs to go far beyond what the SpaceX company will build and that will ultimately involve many more [[economic actor]]s\u2014whether individual, company, or government\u2014to [[emergence|build out]] the settlement over many decades.<ref name=ars20160928/><ref name=sn20161010/>\n\nIn addition to explicit SpaceX plans and concepts for a transportation system and early missions, Musk has personally been a very public exponent of a large systemic vision for building a sustainable human presence on Mars over the very long term<!-- perhaps, expand with Musk's stated rationale for this -->, a vision well beyond what his company or he personally can effect. The growth of such a system over decades cannot be planned in every detail, but is rather a [[complex adaptive system]] that will come about only as others make their own independent choices as to how they might, or might not, connect with the broader \"system\" of an incipient (and later, growing) Mars settlement. Musk sees the new and radically lower-cost transport infrastructure facilitating the buildup of a [[spontaneous order|bottom-up]] [[emergent phenomena|economic order]] of other interested parties\u2014whether companies, individuals, or governments\u2014who will [[innovations|innovate]] and [[supply (economics)|supply]] the [[demand (economics)|demand]] that such a growing venture would occasion.<ref name=ars20160928/><ref name=sn20161010/>\n\nWhile the initial SpaceX Mars settlement would start very small, with an initial group of about a dozen people,<ref name=gw20161023/> with time, Musk hopes that such an outpost would grow into something much larger and become self-sustaining, at least 1 million people. According to Musk,<blockquote>Even at a million people you\u2019re assuming an incredible amount of productivity per person, because you would need to recreate the entire industrial base on Mars.
