He made his debut as a StarCraft: Brood War player in 2007 and retired on December 19, 2015. Lee began playing ''StarCraft II'' competitively in 2011, until his retirement in December 2015.

His career arose to new heights in the  2009-10 season, when he reached the finals of seven premier tournaments - every one held that season - and won five. Three of those victories were against [[Lee Jae-dong]], a famous rival of Lee Young-ho and the second-best player of the time. These achievements have cemented him as one of the greatest players of all time.<ref name=\"wiki.teamliquid.net\">[http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Flash]</ref>\n\nWhen he first emerged as a professional gamer, Lee received criticism for his use of gimmicky \"rush\" strategies. However, he soon developed a versatile and well-rounded play style which revolved around strong mechanics, defensive play, and exemplary late-game army control. [[Choi Yeon-sung]] has praised Lee's strategic depth, saying that \"there aren't many players who set strategic moves, and in the case of [Lee], I think he's looking about 10 games ahead.\"<ref>[http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Flash#Style]</ref> Lee is famous for coming back in games where he was at seemingly insurmountable disadvantages by playing defensive and exploiting small mistakes in his opponents' play to regain the advantage.<ref>[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=108774]</ref>\n\nLee Young-ho set numerous records in [[StarCraft: Brood War professional competition|''StarCraft: Brood War'' professional competition]].

His career arose to new heights in the  2009-10 season, when he reached the finals of seven premier tournaments - every one held that season - and won five. Three of those victories were against [[Lee Jae-dong]], a famous rival of Lee Young-ho and the second-best player of the time. These achievements have cemented him as one of the greatest players of all time.<ref name=\"wiki.teamliquid.net\">[http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Flash]</ref>\n\nWhen he first emerged as a professional gamer, Lee received criticism for his use of gimmicky \"rush\" strategies. However, he soon developed a versatile and well-rounded play style which revolved around strong mechanics, defensive play, and exemplary late-game army control. [[Choi Yeon-sung]] has praised Lee's strategic depth, saying that \"there aren't many players who set strategic moves, and in the case of [Lee], I think he's looking about 10 games ahead.\"<ref>[http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Flash#Style]</ref> Lee is famous for coming back in games where he was at seemingly insurmountable disadvantages by playing defensive and exploiting small mistakes in his opponents' play to regain the advantage.<ref>[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=108774]</ref>\n\nLee Young-ho set numerous records in [[StarCraft: Brood War professional competition|''StarCraft: Brood War'' professional competition]].

He enrolled at the [[Schillinger System#Students|Westlake College of Music]]) and studied with Dave Robertson and Alfred Sendrey. He studied privately with composer and arranger [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russ Garcia]] and Lloyd Reese on the saxophone.<ref name= KING/> He was influenced by the African-American jazz musicians on [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)#Significance in music history|Central Avenue]] in Los Angeles. He heard live music while living nearby and attending Westlake College. He got his first professional start with [[Isaac M. \"Ike\" Carpenter|Ike Carpenter]]'s dance band and then with the [[Charlie Barnet]] Orchestra in 1950 as a tenor saxophonist. He continued with that band for about 18 months. Early commercial work as an arranger came in 1951\u201352 when he wrote charts for band leader and producer [[Bob Keane]] for the album ''Dancing on the Ceiling''.\n\n==The Stan Kenton Orchestra==\nThrough his acquaintance with [[Gene Roland]], Holman was auditioned by [[Stan Kenton]] and hired as a tenor saxophone player for two years in March 1952 (replacing [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]]).<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web |title=Bill Holman |last=Yanow |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Yanow |website=AllMusic |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6761/biography |pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> After working with the band as an instrumentalist, Holman submitted writing to Kenton for the group. His first writing was not an immediate success with Kenton until he was given an assignment to write \"Invention for Guitar and Trumpet\" for [[Sal Salvador]] and [[Maynard Ferguson]]. The chart was to become one of the recognized works for the Kenton orchestra from the album ''[[New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm]]''. It was used in the 1955 movie ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]''.<ref name = \"JAZZPRO\">{{Cite web |url=http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.com/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html |title=Jazz Profiles: Contemporary Concepts - Bill Holman and Stan Kenton |first=Steven |last=Cerra |website=Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com |date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKenton was attracted to Holman's ability to integrate counterpoint and dissonance in subtle yet distinctive ways and for his knack for making the Kenton band \"swing\". Holman became one of Kenton's primary arrangers, creating a signature for the band. His association with the Kenton orchestra lasted nearly 27 years and contribute to Kenton's albums ''New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm'', ''[[Contemporary Concepts]]'' and the Grammy-winning ''[[Adventures in Jazz]]''. Kenton featured Holman as a composer and arranger with [[William Russo (musician)|Bill Russo]] on the 1954 album ''[[Kenton Showcase]]''.\n\n{{quote|In the course of some intense hanging out (with Gene Roland), I had played a recording of a [[Twelve-tone technique|12-tone blues]] that I'd written (doesn't everybody?) while studying at the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood. According to Gene Roland, who had been writing for Kenton for some time, Stan had been talking about a more contrapuntal, linear type of music, and Gene felt that my piece lay in the direction that Stan was considering. While I was away on a short trip with Charlie Barnet, Gene took the recording to Kenton, and when I returned, Stan called. We met, talked, and he asked me to write a couple of pieces for the band. Being young and ambitious, I reached too far in the writing and exceeded my limits - the charts were disasters and never heard of again - but Stan gamely suggested that I do another. By this time I'd heard some of the things that Gerry Mulligan was bringing in, and with a slightly better idea of what was going on, managed to come back down to earth and brought in a better effort, though it, too, was never heard of again.{{sfn |Holman |1990 |p=[http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.de/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html Interview with Bill Holman, 1990], Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com }}}}\n\nHolman's comments about being most influenced by the writing of [[Gerry Mulligan]] as the template for what was correct for the band:\n\n{{quote|Gerry wrote eight to ten scores for the band (early 1952, just before he formed the famous quartet) and, while Young Blood, the most linear of these, was the only one to really thrill Stan, the players (by this time I was playing tenor in the band) loved to play and hear all of them. For me particularly, being only about ten charts out of music school and with no real jazz conception of my own, Gerry's music played a great part in my finding my own voice.{{sfn |Holman |1990 |p=[http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.de/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html Blog, Jazz Profiles: interview with Bill Holman, 1990], Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com}}}}\n\nClassical influences from [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] were also used during this time. Two of the most important arrangements are on the Kenton album ''Contemporary Concepts'' 1955. Holman talked about his arrangements of \"[[What's New?]]\" and \"[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]\":\n\n{{quote|The idea for these two tunes was to write long charts, based on standard tunes, but to make them like an original piece. Just use the changes or a (melodic) fragment to tie it together; in other words, make them like an original \u2013 although you don't get royalties for it! But they were double the length of the usual chart. You could stretch out and do what you want. I remember the day we were all in New York, as part of the '54 All Star Concert Tour with the Kenton guys plus Shorty Rogers and his Quintet. They were going to continue on but I was going to stay there. I remember Shorty, Jack Montrose and I were walking down 48th Street where all the music stores were. We started looking through some scores and I found Bartok's Third and Fourth Quartets. I remember after the band left and I finally got down to writing these charts I was looking through the Bartok things and I got an idea for \"What's New\". Sometimes looking at something like that can give you an idea \u2013 not necessarily something that's specifically in there \u2013 but just puts something you can use into your head. Just an approach. Stan said to make 'em long and not worry bout keeping the melody going all the time. The standard changes are there so you can follow them if you're used to listening to jazz that way.{{sfn |Holman |2009 |p=[https://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2009/08/whats_new_bill_holman_always.html: Interview with Bill Holman August 18, 2009 by Doug Ramsey], Artsjournal.com}}}}\n\n[[Zoot Sims]] joined the group as the solo tenor saxophonist; Kenton asked Holman to write for Sims. Later Holman left the band after an intense discussion about the band's shortcomings; this did not endanger Holman's reputation as a composer and arranger for Kenton. By the mid-1950s, while Holman was in his late 20s, Kenton was commissioning Holman to write as much as he could. He was writing sometimes two charts every week that included concert works, dance charts, originals, and vocals.<ref name = JAZZPRO/> During the 1952-55 period the two primary composers/arrangers who shaped the signature sound of the Kenton orchestra for years to come were Holman and Bill Russo (who was a year younger than Holman). Almost two-thirds of the music recorded by Kenton during this period were from these two writers. Two of the original works of Holman's created for the band during that time include \"Hav-a-Havana\". The other work which has become the quintessential \"Holman signature sound\" of [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal composition]] is \"The Opener\". Though Kenton's taste would evolve and Holman was not functioning as chief arranger by the end of the 1950s, he continued to make key contributions to the Kenton repertoire to 1977 before Kenton's demise in 1979.\n\n\"In sum, it was a pretty high level for an 'earn-as-you-learn' case such as mine, but, ill-equipped as I was, Stan's patience and encouragement and the help of a lot of great players enabled me to make a start in a long and rewarding career. I'll always be grateful (to Stan) for this, but, what the hell, we both got something out of it.\"<ref name = JAZZPRO/> Holman also become a participant and clinician of the [[Stan Kenton Band Clinics]] as an educational component of the orchestra.\n\n==Big band writing==\nHolman wrote for other big bands. Examples of Holman's work for Woody Herman are \"Mulligan Tawny\" and \"Blame Boehm\" that were recorded for Columbia in 1954. Probably the most well known arrangement for the Herman band is Holman's up tempo chart on \"[[After You've Gone (song)|After You've Gone]]\" from the Grammy nominated album ''Woody Herman '64''. The band used three tenor saxes and a baritone sax (no alto saxes). The association and the writing for the Woody Herman continued off and on up through the 1980s; this included [[Bill Holman (musician)#Grammy Award nominated singles or albums contributed to as composer or arranger|four Grammy nominated albums]] Holman's work is recorded on.\n\nIn 1965, drummer [[Buddy Rich]] started a touring big band. Rich's familiarity with Holman's writing came through playing on Harry James' group from earlier in the decade. Holman was one of the first writers to write for Rich's big band book; Rich was looking for updated material of contemporary pop hits that also featured himself (Rich) on drums. Holman became the primary 'go to' composer and arranger helping to create an appeal Rich was to have with much younger audiences at a time when big bands had fallen out of fashion. Drum features and pop/rock tunes Holman wrote greatly helped Rich to achieve a new sound that aided the band to gain a younger listening audience. Holman's writing is featured on several Buddy Rich big band albums from 1966 through 1985 to include Grammy nominated LPs ''[[Big Swing Face (Buddy Rich album)|Big Swing Face]]'' and ''[[Buddy & Soul]]''. Holman's arrangement of the [[Beatles]] \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\" was a commercial success and prominently featured on numerous live television performances creating a high profile early on for Rich's band.His composition \"Ruth\" is a good example of contemporary big band writing during that time of the late 1960s.\n\nOne of the most notable jazz albums Holman wrote was ''[[I Told You So (Count Basie album)|I Told You So]]'', commissioned by the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] and recorded at [[RCA]] studios, New York City in January 1976 (for [[Norman Granz]] and [[Pablo Records]]). Other important groups and big bands he has written and recorded for include names such as [[Louie Bellson]], [[Maynard Ferguson]], Gerry Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band, [[Harry James]], [[Terry Gibbs]], [[The Airmen of Note]] and Chicago Jazz Orchestra.\n\n==West Coast work==\nHolman became an important figure in was to become the [[West Coast jazz]] scene, starting in the 1950s. Through Holman's associations to personnel from Central Avenue, Stan Kenton, and [[Woody Herman]] he assembled small jazz groups and participated in those of others. These include  [[Carmen McRae]], [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]], [[Shorty Rogers]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[The Tonight Show Band]], [[The Manhattan Transfer|Manhattan Transfer]], [[Diane Schuur]], [[J.J. Johnson]], [[Jack Sheldon]], [[Charlie Shoemake]], [[Howard Roberts]], [[Ann Richards (singer)|Ann Richards]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9#Recordings made at the Lighthouse|Lighthouse All-Stars]], [[June Christy]], [[Mel Torme]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Art Pepper]], [[Lennie Niehaus]], [[Conte Candoli]], [[Dave Pell]], [[Shelly Manne]] and [[Terry Gibbs]]. He recorded for several labels and performed often at [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9|The Lighthouse]], Basin Street West, and Donte's.\n\nHolman worked with the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[The Association]], [[The Sandpipers]], and [[The Monkees]]. Each of these four pop groups had award-winning hits and platinum selling records containing Holman's work as an arranger. This roster includes [[Burt Bacharach]],  [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Johnny Desmond]], [[The Four Freshmen]],  [[Jackie & Roy]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Seals & Crofts]], [[Bobby Sherman]], [[Tak Shindo]], [[The Turtles]], [[Randy VanWarmer]] and [[Si Zentner]].\n\nHolman's television credits include ''[[Academy Awards]]'', ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. He wrote film scores for ''[[Swamp Women]]'' (1956), ''Get Out of Town'' (1959), and ''[[Three on a Couch]]'' (1966), ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'', ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'', ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'', ''[[The Marrying Man]]'' and ''[[Sharky's Machine (film)|Sharky's Machine]]''.\n\n==Bill Holman Big Band==\nHe formed a big band in the 1950s which recorded several albums in the late 1950s and early 60s. These albums included ''In a Jazz Orbit'' (1958), ''The Fabulous Bill Holman'' (1958) and ''Bill Holman's Great Big Band'' (1961). The group also recorded several albums under Holman's name backing [[Jackie & Roy]], [[Mark Murphy (singer)|Mark Murphy]] and David Allen. The most notable album of these was with singer [[Anita O'Day]] in 1960/61 entitled ''Incomparable!'' for [[Verve Records]]. By the late 1960s Holman had de-emphasized the group due to his busy schedule, the commercial viability of a big band, and partly because of the departure of drummer [[Mel Lewis]] moving back to New York City.\n\nStarting in 1975, nearly 13 years after his last big band recording, Holman began rehearsing, writing and recording with his own big band again which has won two Grammys. His first recording with the new group in 1988 was ''Bill Holman Band: World Class Music'' (JVC). Pulling in Los Angeles studio musicians who admired and appreciated his work, Holman has been able to release a list of acclaimed CDs, including ''Brilliant Corners'' which features arrangements of tunes written by [[Thelonious Monk]] that won a Grammy in 1997. Holman's band is one of the few regularly rehearsing big bands that meets on a weekly basis. The group has been featured at numerous jazz venues and festivals over the last 30 years to include The Jazz Bakery, the Reno Jazz Festival, Elmhurst Jazz festival, [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and many times at the Los Angeles Jazz Institute's Big Band Bash that happens every May.\n\n==Work with European musicians==\nHolman's writing for large jazz ensemble has had a tremendous impact outside of the United States. He has conducted and recorded with well-known jazz orchestras such as the WDR Big Band in Cologne, the [[BBC Big Band]] in London, [[:de:SWR Big Band|SWR Big Band]] in [[Stuttgart, Germany]], the [[:de:hr-Bigband|hr-Bigband]] in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], [[:de:RIAS Big Band Berlin|RIAS Big Band Berlin]], the [[:de:Klaus Weiss (Schlagzeuger)|Klaus Weiss Big Band]], [[Vic Lewis]], the Norwegian Radio Big Band, [[:de:Bundesjazzorchester|BuJazzO]], and the [[:de:Metropole Orkest|Netherlands Metropole Orchestra]] in [[Amsterdam, Netherlands|Amsterdam]]. Musical scores and recording for Bill Holman are archived in over 20 major countries' national libraries around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viaf.org/viaf/93729533/|title=93729533|website=Viaf.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nHolman has been the arranger and orchestrator on numerous albums that have garnered Grammy nominations; he has personally had 16 nominations total and won 3 times. Holman's first nomination came in 1960 for Best Arrangement for [[Peggy Lee]]'s hit single \"I'm Gonna Go Fishin' \". He was the main contributor as an arranger (3 tracks) to the 1963 [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album|Best Jazz Performance - Large Group (Instrumental)]] category winning [[Stan Kenton]] album ''[[Adventures In Jazz]]''. Holman was a contributing arranger for the 1970 [[12th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Record of the Year]], ''[[The Age of Aquarius (album)|The Age of Aquarius]]'' by [[The 5th Dimension]]. His first Grammy Award win came in [[30th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|1988 for Best Instrumental Arrangement]] (with Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Orchestra).\n\nHe was an important contributing orchestrator/arranger of [[Natalie Cole]]'s [[34th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1992 multiple Grammy winning album]] ''[[Unforgettable... with Love]]'', and her follow up Grammy winning CD's ''[[Take a Look (Natalie Cole album)|Take a Look]]'' and ''[[Still Unforgettable]]''. In 1996, Holman received his 2nd [[38th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition]], \"A View from the Side\", recorded by his Bill Holman Band on the [[JVC]] label. His 3rd Grammy came in 1997 for the recording ''Brilliant Corners/The Music of Thelonious Monk'', it won the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|Grammy Award in 1998]] for Best Instrumental Arrangement for [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella#1990s|Holman's arrangement of \"Straight, No Chaser\"]]. He has been repeatedly selected as one of the leading names in the ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine poll for \"Jazz Arranger/Orchestrator\".\n\nIn May 2000, the Bill Holman Collection of scores and memorabilia was established at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kendormusic.com/cc6/index.php|title=KendorMusic.com|website=Kendormusic.com}}</ref> On January 12, 2010, the National Endowment for the Arts bestowed the 2010 [[NEA Jazz Masters Award]] on Bill Holman, the nation's highest honor for jazz and American Music.

His family moved to [[Orange, California|Orange]], east of [[Anaheim]], then [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]]. He started playing the clarinet in junior high school. While attending high school he played the tenor saxophone and formed a band. Although his family had no musical background, Holman was influenced by [[Count Basie]] and [[Duke Ellington]] while constantly listening to the radio.<ref name= KING/><ref name= \"JAZZWAX1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.jazzwax.com/2008/07/interview-bill.html |title=Interview: Bill Holman (Part 1) |website=Jazzwax.com |accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref> He was drafted at the later end of [[World War II]] and served in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1944 to 1946. Through the Navy, he studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder|University of Colorado]] and then studied at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].\n\nIn the late 1940s he started to concentrate on music instead of engineering. He enrolled at the [[Schillinger System#Students|Westlake College of Music]]) and studied with Dave Robertson and Alfred Sendrey. He studied privately with composer and arranger [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russ Garcia]] and Lloyd Reese on the saxophone.<ref name= KING/> He was influenced by the African-American jazz musicians on [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)#Significance in music history|Central Avenue]] in Los Angeles. He heard live music while living nearby and attending Westlake College. He got his first professional start with [[Isaac M. \"Ike\" Carpenter|Ike Carpenter]]'s dance band and then with the [[Charlie Barnet]] Orchestra in 1950 as a tenor saxophonist. He continued with that band for about 18 months. Early commercial work as an arranger came in 1951\u201352 when he wrote charts for band leader and producer [[Bob Keane]] for the album ''Dancing on the Ceiling''.\n\n==The Stan Kenton Orchestra==\nThrough his acquaintance with [[Gene Roland]], Holman was auditioned by [[Stan Kenton]] and hired as a tenor saxophone player for two years in March 1952 (replacing [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]]).<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web |title=Bill Holman |last=Yanow |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Yanow |website=AllMusic |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6761/biography |pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> After working with the band as an instrumentalist, Holman submitted writing to Kenton for the group. His first writing was not an immediate success with Kenton until he was given an assignment to write \"Invention for Guitar and Trumpet\" for [[Sal Salvador]] and [[Maynard Ferguson]]. The chart was to become one of the recognized works for the Kenton orchestra from the album ''[[New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm]]''. It was used in the 1955 movie ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]''.<ref name = \"JAZZPRO\">{{Cite web |url=http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.com/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html |title=Jazz Profiles: Contemporary Concepts - Bill Holman and Stan Kenton |first=Steven |last=Cerra |website=Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com |date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKenton was attracted to Holman's ability to integrate counterpoint and dissonance in subtle yet distinctive ways and for his knack for making the Kenton band \"swing\". Holman became one of Kenton's primary arrangers, creating a signature for the band. His association with the Kenton orchestra lasted nearly 27 years and contribute to Kenton's albums ''New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm'', ''[[Contemporary Concepts]]'' and the Grammy-winning ''[[Adventures in Jazz]]''. Kenton featured Holman as a composer and arranger with [[William Russo (musician)|Bill Russo]] on the 1954 album ''[[Kenton Showcase]]''.\n\n{{quote|In the course of some intense hanging out (with Gene Roland), I had played a recording of a [[Twelve-tone technique|12-tone blues]] that I'd written (doesn't everybody?) while studying at the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood. According to Gene Roland, who had been writing for Kenton for some time, Stan had been talking about a more contrapuntal, linear type of music, and Gene felt that my piece lay in the direction that Stan was considering. While I was away on a short trip with Charlie Barnet, Gene took the recording to Kenton, and when I returned, Stan called. We met, talked, and he asked me to write a couple of pieces for the band. Being young and ambitious, I reached too far in the writing and exceeded my limits - the charts were disasters and never heard of again - but Stan gamely suggested that I do another. By this time I'd heard some of the things that Gerry Mulligan was bringing in, and with a slightly better idea of what was going on, managed to come back down to earth and brought in a better effort, though it, too, was never heard of again.{{sfn |Holman |1990 |p=[http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.de/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html Interview with Bill Holman, 1990], Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com }}}}\n\nHolman's comments about being most influenced by the writing of [[Gerry Mulligan]] as the template for what was correct for the band:\n\n{{quote|Gerry wrote eight to ten scores for the band (early 1952, just before he formed the famous quartet) and, while Young Blood, the most linear of these, was the only one to really thrill Stan, the players (by this time I was playing tenor in the band) loved to play and hear all of them. For me particularly, being only about ten charts out of music school and with no real jazz conception of my own, Gerry's music played a great part in my finding my own voice.{{sfn |Holman |1990 |p=[http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.de/2017/06/contemporary-concepts-bill-holman-and.html Blog, Jazz Profiles: interview with Bill Holman, 1990], Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com}}}}\n\nClassical influences from [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] were also used during this time. Two of the most important arrangements are on the Kenton album ''Contemporary Concepts'' 1955. Holman talked about his arrangements of \"[[What's New?]]\" and \"[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]\":\n\n{{quote|The idea for these two tunes was to write long charts, based on standard tunes, but to make them like an original piece. Just use the changes or a (melodic) fragment to tie it together; in other words, make them like an original \u2013 although you don't get royalties for it! But they were double the length of the usual chart. You could stretch out and do what you want. I remember the day we were all in New York, as part of the '54 All Star Concert Tour with the Kenton guys plus Shorty Rogers and his Quintet. They were going to continue on but I was going to stay there. I remember Shorty, Jack Montrose and I were walking down 48th Street where all the music stores were. We started looking through some scores and I found Bartok's Third and Fourth Quartets. I remember after the band left and I finally got down to writing these charts I was looking through the Bartok things and I got an idea for \"What's New\". Sometimes looking at something like that can give you an idea \u2013 not necessarily something that's specifically in there \u2013 but just puts something you can use into your head. Just an approach. Stan said to make 'em long and not worry bout keeping the melody going all the time. The standard changes are there so you can follow them if you're used to listening to jazz that way.{{sfn |Holman |2009 |p=[https://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2009/08/whats_new_bill_holman_always.html: Interview with Bill Holman August 18, 2009 by Doug Ramsey], Artsjournal.com}}}}\n\n[[Zoot Sims]] joined the group as the solo tenor saxophonist; Kenton asked Holman to write for Sims. Later Holman left the band after an intense discussion about the band's shortcomings; this did not endanger Holman's reputation as a composer and arranger for Kenton. By the mid-1950s, while Holman was in his late 20s, Kenton was commissioning Holman to write as much as he could. He was writing sometimes two charts every week that included concert works, dance charts, originals, and vocals.<ref name = JAZZPRO/> During the 1952-55 period the two primary composers/arrangers who shaped the signature sound of the Kenton orchestra for years to come were Holman and Bill Russo (who was a year younger than Holman). Almost two-thirds of the music recorded by Kenton during this period were from these two writers. Two of the original works of Holman's created for the band during that time include \"Hav-a-Havana\". The other work which has become the quintessential \"Holman signature sound\" of [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal composition]] is \"The Opener\". Though Kenton's taste would evolve and Holman was not functioning as chief arranger by the end of the 1950s, he continued to make key contributions to the Kenton repertoire to 1977 before Kenton's demise in 1979.\n\n\"In sum, it was a pretty high level for an 'earn-as-you-learn' case such as mine, but, ill-equipped as I was, Stan's patience and encouragement and the help of a lot of great players enabled me to make a start in a long and rewarding career. I'll always be grateful (to Stan) for this, but, what the hell, we both got something out of it.\"<ref name = JAZZPRO/> Holman also become a participant and clinician of the [[Stan Kenton Band Clinics]] as an educational component of the orchestra.\n\n==Big band writing==\nHolman wrote for other big bands. Examples of Holman's work for Woody Herman are \"Mulligan Tawny\" and \"Blame Boehm\" that were recorded for Columbia in 1954. Probably the most well known arrangement for the Herman band is Holman's up tempo chart on \"[[After You've Gone (song)|After You've Gone]]\" from the Grammy nominated album ''Woody Herman '64''. The band used three tenor saxes and a baritone sax (no alto saxes). The association and the writing for the Woody Herman continued off and on up through the 1980s; this included [[Bill Holman (musician)#Grammy Award nominated singles or albums contributed to as composer or arranger|four Grammy nominated albums]] Holman's work is recorded on.\n\nIn 1965, drummer [[Buddy Rich]] started a touring big band. Rich's familiarity with Holman's writing came through playing on Harry James' group from earlier in the decade. Holman was one of the first writers to write for Rich's big band book; Rich was looking for updated material of contemporary pop hits that also featured himself (Rich) on drums. Holman became the primary 'go to' composer and arranger helping to create an appeal Rich was to have with much younger audiences at a time when big bands had fallen out of fashion. Drum features and pop/rock tunes Holman wrote greatly helped Rich to achieve a new sound that aided the band to gain a younger listening audience. Holman's writing is featured on several Buddy Rich big band albums from 1966 through 1985 to include Grammy nominated LPs ''[[Big Swing Face (Buddy Rich album)|Big Swing Face]]'' and ''[[Buddy & Soul]]''. Holman's arrangement of the [[Beatles]] \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\" was a commercial success and prominently featured on numerous live television performances creating a high profile early on for Rich's band.His composition \"Ruth\" is a good example of contemporary big band writing during that time of the late 1960s.\n\nOne of the most notable jazz albums Holman wrote was ''[[I Told You So (Count Basie album)|I Told You So]]'', commissioned by the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] and recorded at [[RCA]] studios, New York City in January 1976 (for [[Norman Granz]] and [[Pablo Records]]). Other important groups and big bands he has written and recorded for include names such as [[Louie Bellson]], [[Maynard Ferguson]], Gerry Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band, [[Harry James]], [[Terry Gibbs]], [[The Airmen of Note]] and Chicago Jazz Orchestra.\n\n===West Coast work===\nHolman became an important figure in was to become the [[West Coast jazz]] scene, starting in the 1950s. Through Holman's associations to personnel from Central Avenue, Stan Kenton, and [[Woody Herman]] he assembled small jazz groups and participated in those of others. These include  [[Carmen McRae]], [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]], [[Shorty Rogers]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[The Tonight Show Band]], [[The Manhattan Transfer|Manhattan Transfer]], [[Diane Schuur]], [[J.J. Johnson]], [[Jack Sheldon]], [[Charlie Shoemake]], [[Howard Roberts]], [[Ann Richards (singer)|Ann Richards]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9#Recordings made at the Lighthouse|Lighthouse All-Stars]], [[June Christy]], [[Mel Torme]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Art Pepper]], [[Lennie Niehaus]], [[Conte Candoli]], [[Dave Pell]], [[Shelly Manne]] and [[Terry Gibbs]]. He recorded for several labels and performed often at [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9|The Lighthouse]], Basin Street West, and Donte's.\n\nHolman worked with the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[The Association]], [[The Sandpipers]], and [[The Monkees]]. Each of these four pop groups had award-winning hits and platinum selling records containing Holman's work as an arranger. This roster includes [[Burt Bacharach]],  [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Johnny Desmond]], [[The Four Freshmen]],  [[Jackie & Roy]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Seals & Crofts]], [[Bobby Sherman]], [[Tak Shindo]], [[The Turtles]], [[Randy VanWarmer]] and [[Si Zentner]].\n\nHolman's television credits include ''[[Academy Awards]]'', ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. He wrote film scores for ''[[Swamp Women]]'' (1956), ''Get Out of Town'' (1959), and ''[[Three on a Couch]]'' (1966), ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'', ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'', ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'', ''[[The Marrying Man]]'' and ''[[Sharky's Machine (film)|Sharky's Machine]]''.\n\n==Bill Holman Big Band==\nHe formed a big band in the 1950s which recorded several albums in the late 1950s and early 60s. These albums included ''In a Jazz Orbit'' (1958), ''The Fabulous Bill Holman'' (1958) and ''Bill Holman's Great Big Band'' (1961). The group also recorded several albums under Holman's name backing [[Jackie & Roy]], [[Mark Murphy (singer)|Mark Murphy]] and David Allen. The most notable album of these was with singer [[Anita O'Day]] in 1960/61 entitled ''Incomparable!'' for [[Verve Records]]. By the late 1960s Holman had de-emphasized the group due to his busy schedule, the commercial viability of a big band, and partly because of the departure of drummer [[Mel Lewis]] moving back to New York City.\n\nStarting in 1975, nearly 13 years after his last big band recording, Holman began rehearsing, writing and recording with his own big band again which has won two Grammys. His first recording with the new group in 1988 was ''Bill Holman Band: World Class Music'' (JVC). Pulling in Los Angeles studio musicians who admired and appreciated his work, Holman has been able to release a list of acclaimed CDs, including ''Brilliant Corners'' which features arrangements of tunes written by [[Thelonious Monk]] that won a Grammy in 1997. Holman's band is one of the few regularly rehearsing big bands that meets on a weekly basis. The group has been featured at numerous jazz venues and festivals over the last 30 years to include The Jazz Bakery, the Reno Jazz Festival, Elmhurst Jazz festival, [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and many times at the Los Angeles Jazz Institute's Big Band Bash that happens every May.\n\n==Work with European musicians==\nHolman's writing for large jazz ensemble has had a tremendous impact outside of the United States. He has conducted and recorded with well-known jazz orchestras such as the WDR Big Band in Cologne, the [[BBC Big Band]] in London, [[:de:SWR Big Band|SWR Big Band]] in [[Stuttgart, Germany]], the [[:de:hr-Bigband|hr-Bigband]] in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], [[:de:RIAS Big Band Berlin|RIAS Big Band Berlin]], the [[:de:Klaus Weiss (Schlagzeuger)|Klaus Weiss Big Band]], [[Vic Lewis]], the Norwegian Radio Big Band, [[:de:Bundesjazzorchester|BuJazzO]], and the [[:de:Metropole Orkest|Netherlands Metropole Orchestra]] in [[Amsterdam, Netherlands|Amsterdam]]. Musical scores and recording for Bill Holman are archived in over 20 major countries' national libraries around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viaf.org/viaf/93729533/|title=93729533|website=Viaf.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nHolman has been the arranger and orchestrator on numerous albums that have garnered Grammy nominations; he has personally had 16 nominations total and won 3 times. Holman's first nomination came in 1960 for Best Arrangement for [[Peggy Lee]]'s hit single \"I'm Gonna Go Fishin' \". He was the main contributor as an arranger (3 tracks) to the 1963 [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album|Best Jazz Performance - Large Group (Instrumental)]] category winning [[Stan Kenton]] album ''[[Adventures In Jazz]]''. Holman was a contributing arranger for the 1970 [[12th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Record of the Year]], ''[[The Age of Aquarius (album)|The Age of Aquarius]]'' by [[The 5th Dimension]]. His first Grammy Award win came in [[30th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|1988 for Best Instrumental Arrangement]] (with Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Orchestra).\n\nHe was an important contributing orchestrator/arranger of [[Natalie Cole]]'s [[34th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1992 multiple Grammy winning album]] ''[[Unforgettable... with Love]]'', and her follow up Grammy winning CD's ''[[Take a Look (Natalie Cole album)|Take a Look]]'' and ''[[Still Unforgettable]]''. In 1996, Holman received his 2nd [[38th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition]], \"A View from the Side\", recorded by his Bill Holman Band on the [[JVC]] label. His 3rd Grammy came in 1997 for the recording ''Brilliant Corners/The Music of Thelonious Monk'', it won the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|Grammy Award in 1998]] for Best Instrumental Arrangement for [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella#1990s|Holman's arrangement of \"Straight, No Chaser\"]]. He has been repeatedly selected as one of the leading names in the ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine poll for \"Jazz Arranger/Orchestrator\".\n\nIn May 2000, the Bill Holman Collection of scores and memorabilia was established at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kendormusic.com/cc6/index.php|title=KendorMusic.com|website=Kendormusic.com}}</ref> On January 12, 2010, the National Endowment for the Arts bestowed the 2010 [[NEA Jazz Masters Award]] on Bill Holman, the nation's highest honor for jazz and American Music.

After the Democratic Party primary in July, a runoff was held in August in which U.S. Congressman [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was officially declared to have defeated former Texas governor [[Coke Stevenson]] by eighty-seven votes.<ref name=\"ussenate\">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Featured_Bio_JohnsonLyndonBaines.htm|title=Lyndon B.

On election night, Johnson held a lead but announced his vote tallies too soon, allowing the opponent to \"find\" enough votes to defeat him. {...} In 1948 he again ran for the Senate and fought a celebrated campaign for the Democratic nomination against the popular Governor Coke Stevenson. Having learned his lesson from the previous Senate race, Johnson held back on announcing his vote tallies and with the help of some friendly political machines eked out an 87-vote victory for which he was dubbed \"Landslide Lyndon.\"|website=US Senate|accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref> produced the fraudulent votes needed for Johnson to have a numerical majority, in effect stealing the election. After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

Assume that the dishonest man secured a pledge of support from the bosses of the Valley, as he probably would. If the race were close, and the honest man ahead by only a few thousand votes with all of the returns in except from the Valley...the election could easily be stolen by having the Valley counties send in just enough votes to put the dishonest man in office. Thus the will of the people of the State would be denied by less than a dozen men, all political feudal lords of the Valley.\" Shelton wrote that as of 1946, \"This has probably not happened yet.\"<ref name=\"Caro p.321\">Caro p.321</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2020|reason=This is an incredibly significant piece of information.

I can only find an article in the Waterloo, IA local newspaper documenting the special election victory for Harper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wcfcourier.com/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-iowa-legislature-harper-s/article_4b7db9e8-df69-59a2-99c1-8321842613d1.html|title=The ins and outs of the Iowa legislature: Harper's back, and she likes it}}</ref>}}\n| {{Party shading/Republican}} | Jim Lind ([[Iowa Republican Party|R]])\n| {{Party shading/Democratic}} | '''Patricia M. \"Pat\" Harper ([[Iowa Democratic Party|D]])'''\n|-\n| [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924977.pdf 8th]\n| February 3, 1998\n| {{Party shading/Republican}} | James E.
