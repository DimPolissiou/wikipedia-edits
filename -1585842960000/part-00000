Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of \"shells\". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.\n\n===Temperature===\n{{Further|Soil thermal properties|Heat capacity|Thermal conduction}}\n\nSoil [[temperature]] depends

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:\n\n: <math>q_x  = - k \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta x}</math>\n\nIn [[SI]] units\n: <math>q</math> is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>\n: <math>k</math> is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7[[Kelvin|K]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x, the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker [[A horizon]] with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor ([[O horizon]]) and thin A horizon.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ponge |first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |year=2003 |title=Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity |journal=[[Soil Biology and Biochemistry]] |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=935\u201345 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00498465/document |doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(03)00149-4 |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Humus===\n[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil microflora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown.

After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.\n\nLignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.<ref name=Verkaik2006>{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D.

Some may have only one horizon.\n\nThe exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Soil classification}}\n\nSoil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil in a particular region. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].\n\n[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values.

It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface.

Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline.

For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name=\"Water Management Institute2010\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |author=International Water Management Institute}}</ref>\n\nIf the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition.

Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of \"shells\". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.\n\n===Temperature===\n{{Further|Soil thermal properties|Heat capacity|Thermal conduction}}\n\nSoil [[temperature]] depends

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:\n\n: <math>q_x  = - k \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta x}</math>\n\nIn [[SI]] units\n: <math>q</math> is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>\n: <math>k</math> is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7[[Kelvin|K]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x, the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker [[A horizon]] with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor ([[O horizon]]) and thin A horizon.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ponge |first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |year=2003 |title=Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity |journal=[[Soil Biology and Biochemistry]] |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=935\u201345 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00498465/document |doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(03)00149-4 |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Humus===\n[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil microflora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown.

After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.\n\nLignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.<ref name=Verkaik2006>{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D.

Some may have only one horizon.\n\nThe exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Soil classification}}\n\nSoil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil in a particular region. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].\n\n[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values.

It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface.

Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline.

For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when [[AT&T]], owner of [[DirecTV]], came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.  Disputes in negotiations  included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an [[A la carte pay television|\"a la carte\"]] basis.\n\n==History==\n\nIn late 2012, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended. Reports published at that time indicated that the team was negotiating with other potential broadcasters, such as the recently established [[Time Warner Cable SportsNet (Los Angeles)|Time Warner Cable SportsNet]], and contemplating forming an in-house network with [[Dick Clark Productions]], a television production company recently purchased by the Dodgers' new parent company, [[Guggenheim Partners]].<ref name=forbes-dcdodgers>{{cite web|last=Ozanian|first=Mark|date=December 14, 2012|title=Dodgers Exploring TV Deal With Dick Clark Productions|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2012/12/14/dodgers-exploring-tv-deal-with-dick-clark-productions/|work=Forbes|access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2013, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that [[Time Warner Cable]] had signed a deal to partner with the Dodgers to form a new regional sports network, which would be majority-owned by the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaikin |first=Bill |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-time-warner-20130122,0,471512.story |title=Dodgers, Time Warner Cable have a deal |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=January 22, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn January 28, the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable signed a 25-year broadcast agreement valued at $8.35 billion,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodgers-tv-standoff-20140718-story.html?track=rss#page=1|title = Standoff over Dodgers games could be defining moment in sports TV|last = Flint|first = Joe|date = July 17, 2014|work = Los Angeles Times|access-date = November 2, 2016}}</ref> subject to the approval of Major League Baseball, which would see the establishment of a new channel known as '''SportsNet LA'''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa |first=Mike |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/21620862/dodgers-announce-deal-with-time-warner-launch-of-sportsnet-la |title=Dodgers announce deal with Time Warner, launch of SportsNet LA |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | date=January 28, 2013 | access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref> The deal ended long-standing broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West, which had aired Dodgers games on its ''Prime Ticket'' channel since [[1997 MLB season|1997]]; and with [[KCAL-TV]], an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] which had been the Dodgers' over-the-air broadcast television outlet since [[2006 MLB season|2006]]. TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by ''Prime Ticket'' in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of [[spring training]], and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future. While the channel is not directly branded with the Dodgers' name, its logo incorporates the team's interlocking \"LA\" insignia; team co-owner Todd Boehly stated that the decision was \"something [Time Warner Cable] thought was really valuable to their brand.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when [[AT&T]], owner of [[DirecTV]], came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.

That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times.

Soon, environmentally friendly entrants span to the [[World Touring Car Championship|World Championship]] stage with [[Alfa Romeo]] unveiling a diesel-powered entry for the 2007 season, which would make them the first manufacturer to enter a diesel-powered car in the World Championship.

The home team for each tie was determined by the toss of a coin unless it was mutually agreed or only one of the two clubs drawn against one another had a private ground. In the event of a draw, the team who lost the toss would have the choice of ground for the replay. A similar procedure was used for subsequent rounds however, any club which had received a bye in the previous round would first be drawn against one of the winners of the previous round. The names of winning teams were placed into one lot for later rounds. The choice of venue for the final matches was reserved to the [[Scottish Football Association]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/uploads/3/3/6/0/3360867/scottish_football_annual_1875.pdf |title=Rules of the Scottish Football Association |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=14 October 1875 |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe exact dates of some matches are unknown as newspaper coverage of football in the late 19th century was not as comprehensive as it would become.<ref name=\"Potter and Jones\"/><ref name=\"Soccer Books\">{{cite book |date=2017 |title=Scottish F.A.

The home team for each tie was determined by the toss of a coin unless it was mutually agreed or only one of the two clubs drawn against one another had a private ground. In the event of a draw, the team who lost the toss would have the choice of ground for the replay. A similar procedure was used for subsequent rounds however, any club which had received a bye in the previous round would first be drawn against one of the winners of the previous round. The names of winning teams were placed into one lot for later rounds. The choice of venue for the final matches was reserved to the [[Scottish Football Association]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/uploads/3/3/6/0/3360867/scottish_football_annual_1875.pdf |title=Rules of the Scottish Football Association |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=14 October 1875 |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe exact dates of some matches are unknown as newspaper coverage of football in the late 19th century was not as comprehensive as it would become.<ref name=\"Potter and Jones\"/><ref name=\"Soccer Books\">{{cite book |date=2017 |title=Scottish F.A.

A [[cartouche]] on the red outer sarcophagus shows that it had originally been made for Pharaoh [[Merenptah]], the [[19th Dynasty]] successor of [[Ramesses II]].

Some Egyptologists have proposed raising the 41 year figure by a decade to 51 years to more closely match certain anonymous Year 48 and Year 49 dates in Upper Egypt. However, the German Egyptologist [[Karl Jansen-Winkeln]] has suggested that all these dates should be attributed to the serving [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priest of Amun]], [[Menkheperre]] instead who is explicitly documented in a Year 48 record.<ref>Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00e4gyptische Sprache'', 119 (1992), p.26</ref> Jansen-Winkeln notes that \"in the first half of Dyn. 21, [the] HP Herihor, Pinedjem I and Menkheperre have royal attributes and [royal] titles to differing extents\" whereas the first three Tanite kings ([[Smendes]], Amenemnisu and Psusennes I) are almost never referred to by name in Upper Egypt with the exception of one graffito and rock stela for Smendes.<ref>Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \"Dynasty 21\" in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, and David Warburton (editors), ''Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, pp. 226-227, 229</ref> In contrast, the name of Psusennes I's Twenty-first Dynasty successors such as [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]], [[Osorkon the Elder]], and [[Siamun]] appear frequently in various documents from Upper Egypt while the Theban High Priest [[Pinedjem II]] who was a contemporary of the latter three kings never adopted any royal attributes or titles in his career.<ref>Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 229</ref>\n\nHence, two separate Year 49 dates from Thebes and [[Kom Ombo]]<ref>[[Kenneth Kitchen]], ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC)'', third edition (Aris & Philips, 1996), pp. 421, 573</ref> could be attributed to the ruling High Priest Menkheperre in Thebes instead of Psusennes I but this remains uncertain. Psusennes I's reign has been estimated at 46 years by the editors of the ''Handbook to Ancient Egyptian Chronology''.<ref>Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 493</ref> Psusennes I must have enjoyed cordial relations with the serving High Priests of Amun in Thebes during his long reign since the High Priest [[Smendes II]] donated several grave goods to this king which were found in Psusennes II's tomb.\n\nDuring his long reign, Psusennes built the enclosure walls and the central part of the Great Temple at Tanis which was dedicated to the triad of [[Amun]], [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]].<ref>Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', (Oxford: Blackwell Books, 1992), pp. 315-317</ref> Psusennes was ostensibly the ruler responsible for turning Tanis into a fully-fledged capital city, surrounding its temple with a formidable brick ''temenos'' wall with its sanctuary dedicated to Amun being composed of blocks salvaged from the derelict [[Pi-Ramesses]]. Many of these blocks were unaltered and kept the name of Pi-Ramesses' builder, [[Ramesses II]], including obelisks still bearing the name of Ramesses II transported from the former capital of Pi-Ramesses to Tanis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Monarchs of the Nile|last=1962-|first=Dodson, Aidan|date=1995|publisher=Rubicon|isbn=094869520X|location=London|pages=155\u2013156|oclc=32925121}}</ref>\n\nPsusennes had taken his sister, [[Mutnedjmet (21st dynasty)|Mutnedjmet]], in marriage, in addition to the Lady Wiay.

A [[cartouche]] on the red outer sarcophagus shows that it had originally been made for Pharaoh [[Merenptah]], the [[19th Dynasty]] successor of [[Ramesses II]].

Some Egyptologists have proposed raising the 41 year figure by a decade to 51 years to more closely match certain anonymous Year 48 and Year 49 dates in Upper Egypt. However, the German Egyptologist [[Karl Jansen-Winkeln]] has suggested that all these dates should be attributed to the serving [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priest of Amun]], [[Menkheperre]] instead who is explicitly documented in a Year 48 record.<ref>Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00e4gyptische Sprache'', 119 (1992), p.26</ref> Jansen-Winkeln notes that \"in the first half of Dyn. 21, [the] HP Herihor, Pinedjem I and Menkheperre have royal attributes and [royal] titles to differing extents\" whereas the first three Tanite kings ([[Smendes]], Amenemnisu and Psusennes I) are almost never referred to by name in Upper Egypt with the exception of one graffito and rock stela for Smendes.<ref>Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \"Dynasty 21\" in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, and David Warburton (editors), ''Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, pp. 226-227, 229</ref> In contrast, the name of Psusennes I's Twenty-first Dynasty successors such as [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]], [[Osorkon the Elder]], and [[Siamun]] appear frequently in various documents from Upper Egypt while the Theban High Priest [[Pinedjem II]] who was a contemporary of the latter three kings never adopted any royal attributes or titles in his career.<ref>Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 229</ref>\n\nHence, two separate Year 49 dates from Thebes and [[Kom Ombo]]<ref>[[Kenneth Kitchen]], ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC)'', third edition (Aris & Philips, 1996), pp. 421, 573</ref> could be attributed to the ruling High Priest Menkheperre in Thebes instead of Psusennes I but this remains uncertain. Psusennes I's reign has been estimated at 46 years by the editors of the ''Handbook to Ancient Egyptian Chronology''.<ref>Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p. 493</ref> Psusennes I must have enjoyed cordial relations with the serving High Priests of Amun in Thebes during his long reign since the High Priest [[Smendes II]] donated several grave goods to this king which were found in Psusennes II's tomb.\n\nDuring his long reign, Psusennes built the enclosure walls and the central part of the Great Temple at Tanis which was dedicated to the triad of [[Amun]], [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]].<ref>Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', (Oxford: Blackwell Books, 1992), pp. 315-317</ref> Psusennes was ostensibly the ruler responsible for turning Tanis into a fully-fledged capital city, surrounding its temple with a formidable brick ''temenos'' wall with its sanctuary dedicated to Amun being composed of blocks salvaged from the derelict [[Pi-Ramesses]]. Many of these blocks were unaltered and kept the name of Pi-Ramesses' builder, [[Ramesses II]], including obelisks still bearing the name of Ramesses II transported from the former capital of Pi-Ramesses to Tanis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Monarchs of the Nile|last=1962-|first=Dodson, Aidan|date=1995|publisher=Rubicon|isbn=094869520X|location=London|pages=155\u2013156|oclc=32925121}}</ref>\n\nPsusennes had taken his sister, [[Mutnedjmet (21st dynasty)|Mutnedjmet]], in marriage, in addition to the Lady Wiay.

It took a lot of effort,\na lot of encouragement for me to accomplish this. Through my experience, I figured that a person cannot\npositively fight alcoholism and drug abuse on themselves, alcoholism is more of a sickness and the\naffected find getting higher the only option. Basically The Addiction And Recovery journey is a long journey but starts with making the First steps which is admitting you're powerless against the drug/substance you're addicted/hooked to & need help;\nMost addicts are usually in denial about the deteriorating effects of the drug on them be it physically or mentally.\nSo i consider it a major-step to starting Recovery accepting you have a drug-dependancy problem that on your own has been quite hard to rid-off because what started as a 'fun'-habit has progressed negatively to the 'habit becoming a disease'.\nIt's considered a disease because the victim has tried to quit but several factors like Peer-pressure, as a means to 'relieve stress' which might seem to be the 'drug induced effect' temporarily but has long-term negative effects on the victim..;not just deteriorating health but also negative character flaws which may lead one to crime sourcing  quick-funds to buy their drug-of-choice.\nThere's also a bad effect on what starts as a 'cool' fun thing maybe 'to blend-in' with your peers e.g. habits that seem harmless like smoking may lead to trying harder-drugs like 'bhang' after the body get's used to the 'ordinary cigarette-high' it needs a 'higher-high' after cigarette let's say 'direct tobacco' via ways e.g. sniffing & this is medically-termed as 'one drug being a Step-Up drug' to a harder-drug & this is a simple case of 'bad-to-worse' & if treated in good-time might not have permanent damage on the person thus.., back to  such old wise-saying's; Prevention is better than Cure, au vile kiMtaa si huambia mamBogi;\n#AmuaChangePunguzaGauge (kwa wale wameOnja kaLife kaa campus peers)\n...but to younger persons like teenagers who haven't yet experimented\n#KutoaLockNiKuekaPadlockKwaFuture\nAs a team which we started with my 'fan-turned friend&co-founder #JimwatSoloFoundation   U.S-Sgt.Solomon Omboto who used to advice me against alcohol-dependency, i use my #AddictionAndRecovery story which has been a tough-journey aiming to help guys who feel they have alcohol or drug abuse related issue.

Basically The Addiction And Recovery journey is a long journey but starts with making the First steps which is admitting you're powerless against the drug/substance you're addicted/hooked to & need help;\nMost addicts are usually in denial about the deteriorating effects of the drug on them be it physically or mentally.\nSo i consider it a major-step to starting Recovery accepting you have a drug-dependancy problem that on your own has been quite hard to rid-off because what started as a 'fun'-habit has progressed negatively to the 'habit becoming a disease'.\nIt's considered a disease because the victim has tried to quit but several factors like Peer-pressure, as a means to 'relieve stress' which might seem to be the 'drug induced effect' temporarily but has long-term negative effects on the victim..;not just deteriorating health but also negative character flaws which may lead one to crime sourcing  quick-funds to buy their drug-of-choice.\nThere's also a bad effect on what starts as a 'cool' fun thing maybe 'to blend-in' with your peers e.g. habits that seem harmless like smoking may lead to trying harder-drugs like 'bhang' after the body get's used to the 'ordinary cigarette-high' it needs a 'higher-high' after cigarette let's say 'direct tobacco' via ways e.g. sniffing & this is medically-termed as 'one drug being a Step-Up drug' to a harder-drug & this is a simple case of 'bad-to-worse' & if treated in good-time might not have permanent damage on the person thus.., back to  such old wise-saying's; Prevention is better than Cure, au vile kiMtaa si huambia mamBogi;\n#AmuaChangePunguzaGauge (kwa wale wameOnja kaLife kaa campus peers)\n...but to younger persons like teenagers who haven't yet experimented\n#KutoaLockNiKuekaPadlockKwaFuture\nAs a team which we started with my 'fan-turned friend&co-founder #JimwatSoloFoundation   U.S-Sgt.Solomon Omboto who used to advice me against alcohol-dependency, i use my #AddictionAndRecovery story which has been a tough-journey aiming to help guys who feel they have alcohol or drug abuse related issue.
