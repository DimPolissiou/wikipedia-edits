The series premiered on November 19, 2004 and ended on June 27, 2006 with a total of three seasons and 39 episodes, leaving a total of 34 episodes aired and five episodes unaired in North America.\n\nDuring its run, the series has been nominated for an [[Annie Award]] three times. The series has developed a strong [[cult following]]. Merchandise based on the series has also been produced during its run, such as video games, home media releases, toys, and clothing.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Characters.png|220px|thumb|left|The main cast of the show. From left to right: Ami, Kaz, Yumi, Jang-Keng, and Tekirai.]]\n''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' follows the adventures of two [[pop stars]] and best friends: [[Yumi Yoshimura]] ([[Grey DeLisle]]), a cynical, sarcastic, rough and tough [[punk rock]]er; and [[Ami Onuki]] ([[Janice Kawaye]]), a peppy, optimistic and cute schoolgirl. Both are based off the real Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]], but with different appearances and exaggerated personalities. They travel around the world on their customized tour bus along with their well-intentioned yet greedy manager Kaz Harada ([[Keone Young]]). From rocking out at a concert to hanging out in their hometown of [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]], the duo take the world by storm with their musical talent, trend-setting style, and humor, dishing out lessons in J-pop justice and establishing the international language of \"cool\" along the way.\n\nSecondary characters include: Jang-Keng (Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (Janice Kawaye), the duo's pet cats who enjoy tormenting Kaz; Harmony ([[Sandy Fox]]), a six-year-old girl who is the self-proclaimed \"Number One Fan\" of Puffy AmiYumi and (later) Kaz and constantly stalks them; Eldwin Blair (Nathan Carlson), a sinister land developer who tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs; King Chad ([[Katie Leigh]]), a selfish \"bad boy\" who is a master of the card game ''Stu-Pi-Doh!'' (a parody of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''); the evil Talent Suckers (Nathan Carlson; [[Corey Burton]]), a [[vampire]] rock trio from [[Transylvania]]; and Atchan ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a caricature of Vo Atsushi (lead singer of the [[Pop music|pop]] band New Rote'ka) who speaks in third-person and thinks he is a superhero.\n\nThe animated Puffy AmiYumi travel all over the world in their tour bus. While appearing the same size as a regular bus on the outside, it appears to have enough internal space to house the girls' rooms (including full-sized beds), Kaz's room, their equipment, televisions, and computers, among other things. In the episode \"Domo\", Kaz refers to an upstairs area. It also seems capable of running on autopilot, as Kaz, Ami, and Yumi are sometimes sitting in the rear cabin of the bus while traveling. Occasionally, the rear door has been opened to receive packages delivered by a boy on a scooter.\n\nDuring the first season, the show included [[live-action]] clips of the real Ami and Yumi making childish commentary (in English and non-subtitled Japanese) at the beginning and end of each episode. They only performed short clips at the beginning of the show during the second and third seasons. Starting with the second season, the duo was sometimes shown holding title cards introducing the cartoon segments. At the end of the episode \"Sitcomi Yumi\", Ami and Yumi watched television and saw the animated Kaz with the real Ami and Yumi. All of the live-action clips were produced by Freegate, Ltd.\n\nThe real PUFFY performs the cartoon's theme song (which is also in Japanese, German, European French, Canadian French, Castilian Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Chinese, Taiwanese Mandarin, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese in the respective regions), and many episodes feature one or more of the duo's songs playing in the background, along with music by [[Andy Sturmer]].\n\nThough the characters speak English, the script intersperses their [[vernacular]] with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speech, especially when the characters react to events that they find to be surprising. Calling out \"Tasukete!\" instead of \"Help!\" is commonly used.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:HHPAY Girls Rock!.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A picture of Ami and Yumi, titled \"Girls Rock!\", is done by [[Lynne Naylor]], one of the show's character designers back in 2005.]]\nAccording to Register, the target audience of the show is boys and girls from 6\u201311 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=6 |title=Interview with Sam Register: Page 6 |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124038/http://animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=6 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> However, it also has a [[cult following]] of teen and adult fans of the real-life [[Ami Onuki]] and [[Yumi Yoshimura]] who make up the Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]]. Register, who was a fan of the band, wished to spread its fame to other parts of the world and thus created the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=4 |title=Interview with Sam Register: Page 4 |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124004/http://animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=4 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe series features the adventures of animated versions of the duo, who have been immensely popular in Japan since making their debut in 1996. The group now has its own U.S. albums, including a 2004 companion album to this program, and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the USA for performing the theme to the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]]. During production of the series, DeLisle learned some Japanese from Kawaye and Young, both of whom speak the language fluently.\n\nThe cartoon was one of the few cartoons at the time produced entirely in the United States (thus making their choice of characters quite ironic), with a number of characters designed by famed Canadian artist [[Lynne Naylor]] which got the show nominated for the coveted Annie Award. It used a combination of [[Macromedia Flash]] and traditional [[cel animation]].<ref>See boards drawings on [http://puffycrew.blogspot.com Puffy Crew Blog].</ref> Each program was 30 minutes long (with commercials) and featured three seven-minute segments.

Renegade Animation originally, at first, created other Cartoon Network pilots before ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi''; two of which feature ''Captain Sturdy''; one in 2001, entitled \"Back in Action\", and the other in 2003, entitled \"The Originals\", but they were ultimately rejected, and Renegade Animation then started working on ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' starting with its pilot on April 22, 2003. The pilot was not broadcast, but was initially successful, and got the green-light from Cartoon Network. Finally, it was shown in non-full version as a preview on Cartoon Network DVDs and VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6f-12EfUcA |title=Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Pilot Promo - YouTube |publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}</ref> The entire pilot was found by series' director, [[Darrell Van Citters]], and was uploaded to Vimeo on April 5, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lostmediawiki.com/Hi_Hi_Puffy_AmiYumi_(found_unaired_pilot_of_Cartoon_Network_animated_series;_2003) |title=Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi - Unaired Pilot - Lost Media Page |publisher=lostmediawiki.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/263460712 |title=Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi - Full Unaired Pilot - Vimeo |publisher=vimeo.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe series was officially announced at Cartoon Network's upfront on February 26, 2004.

Afterwards, the network removed all mention of the series from its website.\n\nCartoon Network didn't acknowledge the series again until 2012, when Ami and Yumi appeared on the channel's 20th anniversary poster.<ref>[http://asset-2.soup.io/asset/4290/2953_25d1.jpeg Cartoon Network's 20th Anniversary Poster With Ami And Yumi]</ref>\n\nYumi later made a [[cameo appearance]] in the ''[[OK K.O.!

The series premiered on November 19, 2004 and ended on June 27, 2006 with a total of three seasons and 39 episodes, leaving a total of 34 episodes aired and five episodes unaired in North America.\n\nDuring its run, the series has been nominated for an [[Annie Award]] three times. The series has developed a strong [[cult following]]. Merchandise based on the series has also been produced during its run, such as video games, home media releases, toys, and clothing.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Characters.png|220px|thumb|left|The main cast of the show. From left to right: Ami, Kaz, Yumi, Jang-Keng, and Tekirai.]]\n''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' follows the adventures of two [[pop stars]] and best friends: [[Yumi Yoshimura]] ([[Grey DeLisle]]), a cynical, sarcastic, rough and tough [[punk rock]]er; and [[Ami Onuki]] ([[Janice Kawaye]]), a peppy, optimistic and cute schoolgirl. Both are based off the real Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]], but with different appearances and exaggerated personalities. They travel around the world on their customized tour bus along with their well-intentioned yet greedy manager Kaz Harada ([[Keone Young]]). From rocking out at a concert to hanging out in their hometown of [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]], the duo take the world by storm with their musical talent, trend-setting style, and humor, dishing out lessons in J-pop justice and establishing the international language of \"cool\" along the way.\n\nSecondary characters include: Jang-Keng (Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (Janice Kawaye), the duo's pet cats who enjoy tormenting Kaz; Harmony ([[Sandy Fox]]), a six-year-old girl who is the self-proclaimed \"Number One Fan\" of Puffy AmiYumi and (later) Kaz and constantly stalks them; Eldwin Blair (Nathan Carlson), a sinister land developer who tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs; King Chad ([[Katie Leigh]]), a selfish \"bad boy\" who is a master of the card game ''Stu-Pi-Doh!'' (a parody of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''); the evil Talent Suckers (Nathan Carlson; [[Corey Burton]]), a [[vampire]] rock trio from [[Transylvania]]; and Atchan ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a caricature of Vo Atsushi (lead singer of the [[Pop music|pop]] band New Rote'ka) who speaks in third-person and thinks he is a superhero.\n\nThe animated Puffy AmiYumi travel all over the world in their tour bus. While appearing the same size as a regular bus on the outside, it appears to have enough internal space to house the girls' rooms (including full-sized beds), Kaz's room, their equipment, televisions, and computers, among other things. In the episode \"Domo\", Kaz refers to an upstairs area. It also seems capable of running on autopilot, as Kaz, Ami, and Yumi are sometimes sitting in the rear cabin of the bus while traveling. Occasionally, the rear door has been opened to receive packages delivered by a boy on a scooter.\n\nDuring the first season, the show included [[live-action]] clips of the real Ami and Yumi making childish commentary (in English and non-subtitled Japanese) at the beginning and end of each episode. They only performed short clips at the beginning of the show during the second and third seasons. Starting with the second season, the duo was sometimes shown holding title cards introducing the cartoon segments. At the end of the episode \"Sitcomi Yumi\", Ami and Yumi watched television and saw the animated Kaz with the real Ami and Yumi. All of the live-action clips were produced by Freegate, Ltd.\n\nThe real PUFFY performs the cartoon's theme song (which is also in Japanese, German, European French, Canadian French, Castilian Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Chinese, Taiwanese Mandarin, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese in the respective regions), and many episodes feature one or more of the duo's songs playing in the background, along with music by [[Andy Sturmer]].\n\nThough the characters speak English, the script intersperses their [[vernacular]] with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speech, especially when the characters react to events that they find to be surprising. Calling out \"Tasukete!\" instead of \"Help!\" is commonly used.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:HHPAY Girls Rock!.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A picture of Ami and Yumi, titled \"Girls Rock!\", is done by [[Lynne Naylor]], one of the show's character designers back in 2005.]]\nAccording to Register, the target audience of the show is boys and girls from 6\u201311 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=6 |title=Interview with Sam Register: Page 6 |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124038/http://animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&document=6 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> However, it also has a [[cult following]] of teen and adult fans of the real-life [[Ami Onuki]] and [[Yumi Yoshimura]] who make up the Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]].

The group now has its own U.S. albums, including a 2004 companion album to this program, and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the USA for performing the theme to the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]]. During production of the series, DeLisle learned some Japanese from Kawaye and Young, both of whom speak the language fluently.\n\nThe cartoon was one of the few cartoons at the time produced entirely in the United States (thus making their choice of characters quite ironic), with a number of characters designed by famed Canadian artist [[Lynne Naylor]] which got the show nominated for the coveted Annie Award. It used a combination of [[Macromedia Flash]] and traditional [[cel animation]].<ref>See boards drawings on [http://puffycrew.blogspot.com Puffy Crew Blog].</ref> Each program was 30 minutes long (with commercials) and featured three seven-minute segments.

Renegade Animation originally, at first, created other Cartoon Network pilots before ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi''; two of which feature ''Captain Sturdy''; one in 2001, entitled \"Back in Action\", and the other in 2003, entitled \"The Originals\", but they were ultimately rejected, and Renegade Animation then started working on ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' starting with its pilot on April 22, 2003. The pilot was not broadcast, but was initially successful, and got the green-light from Cartoon Network.

Afterwards, the network removed all mention of the series from its website.\n\nCartoon Network didn't acknowledge the series again until 2012, when Ami and Yumi appeared on the channel's 20th anniversary poster.<ref>[http://asset-2.soup.io/asset/4290/2953_25d1.jpeg Cartoon Network's 20th Anniversary Poster With Ami And Yumi]</ref>\n\nYumi later made a [[cameo appearance]] in the ''[[OK K.O.!

{"title_page": "Toxic asset", "text_new": "A '''toxic asset''' is a [[financial asset]] that has fallen in value significantly and for which there is no longer a functioning market. Such assets cannot be sold at a price satisfactory to the holder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxic Assets|url=http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/stock-market/toxic-assets-2268|website=Investing Answers|publisher=investinganswers.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Because assets are offset against liabilities and frequently leveraged, this decline in price may be quite dangerous to the holder. The term became common during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], in which they played a major role.\n\nWhen the market for toxic assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew much worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to reduce significantly their stated assets, making them, at least on paper, insolvent.\n\nToxic assets are also euphemistically labeled '''troubled assets'''.\n\n==Origin==\nThe term was in limited use at least as early as 2006, and may have been coined by or popularized by [[Angelo Mozilo]], founder of [[Countrywide Financial]], who used the term \"toxic\" to describe certain mortgage products in emails in spring of 2006, as revealed in SEC filings:<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Mozilo knew hazardous waste when he saw it\n|date=2009-06-04\n|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]\n|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2009/06/the-use-of-toxic-to-describe-high-risk-mortgages-has-been-de-rigueur-for-the-last-two-years-now-it-looks-like-countrywide.html\n}}</ref>\n:\"[The 100% [[loan-to-value]] subprime loan is] the most dangerous product in existence and there can be nothing more toxic...\" (March 28, 2006)\nRegarding Countrywide's subprime 80/20 loans:\n:\"In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic prduct [sic]. It's not only subordinated to the first, but the first is subprime. In addition, the [[FICO score#FICO score|FICO]]s are below 600, below 500 and some below 400[.] With real estate values coming down ... the product will become increasingly worse.\" (April 17, 2006)\n\n==Market freeze==\nWhen the [[supply and demand]] of a good equal each other, so buyers and sellers are matched, one says that the \"[[Market clearing|market clears]]\".\n\n[[Classical economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]] posit that market clearing happens by the price adjusting\u2014upwards if demand exceeds supply and downwards if supply exceeds demand. Therefore, it reaches [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] at a price that both buyers and sellers will accept, and, in the absence of outside interference (in a free market), this will happen.\n\nThis has not happened for many types of financial assets during the financial crisis that began in 2007, hence one speaks of \"the market breaking down\".\n\nOne can explain this alternately as the price not adjusting down\u2014the price is too high, with supply being too high, or alternatively demand being too low, or by the theory of an equilibrium price not holding\u2014the price at which sellers will sell is higher than the price at which buyers will buy.\n\nPrior to the crisis, banks and other financial institutions had invested significant amounts of money in complicated financial assets, such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s and [[credit default swap]]s. The value of these assets was very sensitive to economic factors, such as housing prices, default rates, and financial-market liquidity. Prior to the crisis, the value of these assets had been estimated, using the prevailing economic data.\n\nWhen it became clear that such conditions would not continue, it was no longer clear how much revenue the assets were likely to generate and, hence, how much the assets were worth. Since the assets were typically very sensitive to economic conditions, even relatively small uncertainties in the economic conditions could lead to large uncertainties in the value of the assets, which made it difficult for buyers and sellers in the market to agree on prices.\n\nFurthermore, banks and other large financial institutions were reluctant to accept lower prices for these assets, since lower prices would force them to recalculate the total value of their assets, and, if the loss was sufficiently large, force them to declare a negative total value. Several banks in the autumn of 2008 were forced to accept buy-outs or mergers because it was believed that they were in this situation. This re-evaluation of total assets based on prevailing market prices is known as [[mark-to-market]] pricing. The term ''[[zombie bank]]'' was introduced to describe banks, which would have become bankrupt if their assets had been revalued at realistic levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23krugman.html|title=All the President's zombies |work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-22 | first=Paul | last=Krugman | date=February 23, 2009}}</ref> Toxic assets, by increasing the variance of banks' assets, can turn otherwise healthy institutions into zombies.

The term became common during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], in which they played a major role.\n\nWhen the market for toxic assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew much worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to reduce significantly their stated assets, making them, at least on paper, insolvent.\n\nToxic assets are also euphemistically labeled '''troubled assets'''.\n\n==Origin==\nThe term was in limited use at least as early as 2006, and may have been coined by or popularized by [[Angelo Mozilo]], founder of [[Countrywide Financial]], who used the term \"toxic\" to describe certain mortgage products in emails in spring of 2006, as revealed in SEC filings:<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Mozilo knew hazardous waste when he saw it\n|date=2009-06-04\n|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]\n|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2009/06/the-use-of-toxic-to-describe-high-risk-mortgages-has-been-de-rigueur-for-the-last-two-years-now-it-looks-like-countrywide.html\n}}</ref>\n:\"[The 100% [[loan-to-value]] subprime loan is] the most dangerous product in existence and there can be nothing more toxic...\" (March 28, 2006)\nRegarding Countrywide's subprime 80/20 loans:\n:\"In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic prduct [sic].

Therefore, it reaches [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] at a price that both buyers and sellers will accept, and, in the absence of outside interference (in a free market), this will happen.\n\nThis has not happened for many types of financial assets during the financial crisis that began in 2007, hence one speaks of \"the market breaking down\".\n\nOne can explain this alternately as the price not adjusting down\u2014the price is too high, with supply being too high, or alternatively demand being too low, or by the theory of an equilibrium price not holding\u2014the price at which sellers will sell is higher than the price at which buyers will buy.\n\nPrior to the crisis, banks and other financial institutions had invested significant amounts of money in complicated financial assets, such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s and [[credit default swap]]s.
