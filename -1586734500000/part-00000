However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits.

For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] going into rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility.

The success of \"[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and on two episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n\nThe other singles released from ''Nimrod'' were \"[[Nice Guys Finish Last]]\", \"[[Hitchin' a Ride (Green Day song)|Hitchin' a Ride]]\" and \"[[Redundant (song)|Redundant]]\".

Charles Isherwood of [[The New York Times]] wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I\u2019ve seen on Broadway this season.

For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] going into rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility.

The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, [[surf rock]], and [[ska]], to an acoustic ballad. ''Nimrod'' entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and on two episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n\nThe other singles released from ''Nimrod'' were \"[[Nice Guys Finish Last]]\", \"[[Hitchin' a Ride (Green Day song)|Hitchin' a Ride]]\" and \"[[Redundant (song)|Redundant]]\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.

Charles Isherwood of [[The New York Times]] wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I\u2019ve seen on Broadway this season.
