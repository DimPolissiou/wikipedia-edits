With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131988), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref>Robin Elliott: \"White, Harry\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2013), see Bibliography.</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative. His monographs and edited volumes have been reviewed as being major works of scholarship\".<ref>Lorraine Byrne Bodley and Robin Elliott, introduction to ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag, 2018), p. 19; see Bibliography.</ref> In 1990, he established the ongoing book series ''Irish Musical Studies'', of which he is joint general editor with [[Gerard Gillen]]. In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>\"The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland\", in: ''The Irish Review'' vol. 6 (1989), pp. 39\u201345.</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref> https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients/; retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref> Lorraine Byrne Bodley (ed.): ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna, 2018); see Bibliography.</ref> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>Publisher\u2019s information, http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/, retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Well-tempered Festschrift.

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131998), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref>Robin Elliott: \"White, Harry\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2013), see Bibliography.</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative. His monographs and edited volumes have been reviewed as being major works of scholarship\".<ref>Lorraine Byrne Bodley and Robin Elliott, introduction to ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag, 2018), p. 19; see Bibliography.</ref> In 1990, he established the ongoing book series ''Irish Musical Studies'', of which he is joint general editor with [[Gerard Gillen]]. In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>\"The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland\", in: ''The Irish Review'' vol. 6 (1989), pp. 39\u201345.</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref> https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients/; retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref> Lorraine Byrne Bodley (ed.): ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna, 2018); see Bibliography.</ref> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>Publisher\u2019s information, http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/, retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Well-tempered Festschrift.

{"title_page": "Aquifer thermal energy storage", "text_new": "'''Aquifer thermal energy storage''' (ATES) is the [[Thermal energy storage|storage]] and recovery of [[thermal energy]] in the subsurface. ATES is applied to provide heating and cooling to buildings.\nStorage and recovery of thermal energy is achieved by extraction and injection of [[groundwater]] from [[aquifer]]s using groundwater wells. Systems commonly operate in a seasonal mode. The groundwater that is extracted in summer, is used for cooling by transferring heat from the building to the groundwater by means of a [[heat exchanger]]. Subsequently, the heated groundwater is injected back into the aquifer, which creates a storage of heated groundwater. In wintertime, the flow direction is reversed such that the heated groundwater is extracted and can be used for heating (often in combination with a [[heat pump]]). Therefore, operating an ATES system uses the subsurface as a temporal storage to buffer seasonal variations in heating and cooling demand. When replacing traditional fossil fuel dependent heating and cooling systems, ATES can serve as a cost-effective technology to reduce the primary energy consumption of a building and the associated CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2009 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, many countries and regions have made targets for global [[climate protection]]. The European Union also set a target to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]], increase use of [[sustainable energy]] and improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. For this target, ATES can actually contribute significantly, as about 40% of [[global energy consumption]] is done by buildings, and is mainly for [[heating]] and [[cooling]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Rosa |first1=Mattia |last2=Bianco |first2=Vincenzo |last3=Scarpa |first3=Federico |last4=Tagliafico |first4=Luca A. |date=2014 |title=Heating and cooling building energy demand evaluation; a simplified model and a modified degree days approach |journal=Applied Energy |volume=128 |pages=217\u2013229 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.067}}</ref> Therefore, the development of ATES has been paid a lot of attention and the number of ATES has increased dramatically, especially in Europe. For example, in the Netherlands, it was estimated that about 20,000 ATES systems could be achieved by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Godschalk |first1=M.S. |last2=Bakema |first2=G. |date=2009 |title=20,000 ATES Systems in the Netherlands in 2020 \u2013 Major step towards a sustainable energy supply |work=Proceedings Effstock |url=http://www.iftec.es/files/ATES_in_NL_in_2020-r6cngn.pdf}}</ref> This can yield a CO2 emission reduction of about 11%, for the target of the Netherlands.

One well is used for heat storage, and the other for cold storage. During winter, (warm) groundwater is extracted from the heat storage well and injected in the cold storage well. During summer, the flow direction is reversed such that (cold) groundwater is extracted from the cold storage well and injected in the heat storage well. Because each well serves both as an extraction and injection well, these systems are called bi-directional.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickinson |first1=J.

These systems do not switch pumping direction, such that groundwater is always extracted at the natural aquifer temperature. Although thermal energy is stored in the subsurface, there is usually no intention to retrieve the stored energy.\n\nThermal energy storage can also be achieved by circulating a fluid through a buried [[heat exchanger]], that usually consists of a horizontal or vertical pipeline. As these systems do not extract or inject groundwater, they are called closed systems and are known as borehole thermal energy storage or [[ground source heat pumps]]. Another thermal application that uses the subsurface to provide thermal energy is [[geothermal energy]] production, which commonly uses the deeper subsurface where temperature is higher.\n\n== History ==\nThe first reported deliberate storage of thermal energy in aquifers was in China around 1960.<ref name=\"Paksoy2007\">{{cite book |editor-last=Paksoy |editor-first=Halime \u00d6. |date=2007 |title=Thermal energy storage for sustainable energy consumption: fundamentals, case studies and design |series=NATO science series.

To inhibit the subsidence, cold surface water was injected back into the aquifer. Subsequently, it was observed that the stored water remained cold after injection and could be used for industrial cooling.

Despite the regulations made to prevent the interference between ATES and groundwater contaminants, the possibility of their encounter is however rising, because of the rapid increase of the number of ATES and slow progress of remediation groundwater contaminations in urban area. Among the common groundwater contaminants, chlorinated ethenes have a most chance to interfere with the ATES system, as they are often found at the similar depth as ATES. When chlorinated ethenes present as [[Dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPLs), the possible dissolution of DNAPLs by ATES will cause more severe impact on the groundwater quality.<ref>Parker, J.C. and Park, E., 2004.

Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES can be used as a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive dechlorination. Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation.\n\n==Societal impacts ==\nThe combination concept of ATES and enhanced natural attenuation (ATES-ENA) can possibly be used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this combined technology. However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Ni2015\" /> For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Aquifers]]\n[[Category:Energy storage]]\n", "text_old": "'''Aquifer thermal energy storage''' (ATES) is the [[Thermal energy storage|storage]] and recovery of [[thermal energy]] in the subsurface. ATES is applied to provide heating and cooling to buildings.\nStorage and recovery of thermal energy is achieved by extraction and injection of [[groundwater]] from [[aquifer]]s using groundwater wells. Systems commonly operate in a seasonal mode. The groundwater that is extracted in summer, is used for cooling by transferring heat from the building to the groundwater by means of a [[heat exchanger]]. Subsequently, the heated groundwater is injected back into the aquifer, which creates a storage of heated groundwater. In wintertime, the flow direction is reversed such that the heated groundwater is extracted and can be used for heating (often in combination with a [[heat pump]]). Therefore, operating an ATES system uses the subsurface as a temporal storage to buffer seasonal variations in heating and cooling demand. When replacing traditional fossil fuel dependent heating and cooling systems, ATES can serve as a cost-effective technology to reduce the primary energy consumption of a building and the associated CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2009 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, many countries and regions have made targets for global [[climate protection]]. The European Union also set a target to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]], increase use of [[sustainable energy]] and improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. For this target, ATES can actually contribute significantly, as about 40% of [[global energy consumption]] is done by buildings, and is mainly for [[heating]] and [[cooling]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Rosa |first1=Mattia |last2=Bianco |first2=Vincenzo |last3=Scarpa |first3=Federico |last4=Tagliafico |first4=Luca A. |date=2014 |title=Heating and cooling building energy demand evaluation; a simplified model and a modified degree days approach |journal=Applied Energy |volume=128 |pages=217\u2013229 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.067}}</ref> Therefore, the development of ATES has been paid a lot of attention and the number of ATES has increased dramatically, especially in Europe. For example, in the Netherlands, it was estimated that about 20,000 ATES systems could be achieved by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Godschalk |first1=M.S. |last2=Bakema |first2=G. |date=2009 |title=20,000 ATES Systems in the Netherlands in 2020 \u2013 Major step towards a sustainable energy supply |work=Proceedings Effstock |url=http://www.iftec.es/files/ATES_in_NL_in_2020-r6cngn.pdf}}</ref> This can yield a CO2 emission reduction of about 11%, for the target of the Netherlands.

One well is used for heat storage, and the other for cold storage. During winter, (warm) groundwater is extracted from the heat storage well and injected in the cold storage well. During summer, the flow direction is reversed such that (cold) groundwater is extracted from the cold storage well and injected in the heat storage well. Because each well serves both as an extraction and injection well, these systems are called bi-directional.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickinson |first1=J.

These systems do not switch pumping direction, such that groundwater is always extracted at the natural aquifer temperature. Although thermal energy is stored in the subsurface, there is usually no intention to retrieve the stored energy.\n\nThermal energy storage can also be achieved by circulating a fluid through a buried [[heat exchanger]], that usually consists of a horizontal or vertical pipeline. As these systems do not extract or inject groundwater, they are called closed systems and are known as borehole thermal energy storage or [[ground source heat pumps]]. Another thermal application that uses the subsurface to provide thermal energy is [[geothermal energy]] production, which commonly uses the deeper subsurface where temperature is higher.\n\n== History ==\nThe first reported deliberate storage of thermal energy in aquifers was in China around 1960.<ref name=\"Paksoy2007\">{{cite book |editor-last=Paksoy |editor-first=Halime \u00d6. |date=2007 |title=Thermal energy storage for sustainable energy consumption: fundamentals, case studies and design |series=NATO science series.

To inhibit the subsidence, cold surface water was injected back into the aquifer. Subsequently, it was observed that the stored water remained cold after injection and could be used for industrial cooling. Storage of thermal energy in aquifers was further suggested in the 1970s which led to field experiments and feasibility studies in France, Switzerland, US and Japan.<ref>Tsang, C.F., D. Hopkins, and G. Hellstrom, Aquifer thermal energy storage \u2013 a survey. 1980, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.</ref> There are no official statistics on the number and size of ATES systems worldwide.

Mainly, ATES requires the presence of a suitable aquifer that is able to accept and yield water. Therefore, thick (>10 m) sandy aquifers are selected. Natural groundwater flow may transport (part of) the stored energy outside of the capture zone of a well during the storage phase.<ref>Sommer, W., Valstar, J., Gaans, P., Grotenhuis, T. and Rijnaarts, H., 2013.

Despite the regulations made to prevent the interference between ATES and groundwater contaminants, the possibility of their encounter is however rising, because of the rapid increase of the number of ATES and slow progress of remediation groundwater contaminations in urban area. Among the common groundwater contaminants, chlorinated ethenes have a most chance to interfere with the ATES system, as they are often found at the similar depth as ATES. When chlorinated ethenes present as [[Dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPLs), the possible dissolution of DNAPLs by ATES will cause more severe impact on the groundwater quality.<ref>Parker, J.C. and Park, E., 2004.

La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]].

The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England. Many ex-convicts and convicts on tickets of leave and conditional pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''10 December 1859''' \u2013 [[Queensland]] is [[Separation of Queensland|separated from New South Wales]]. In 1824 the explorer Lt. [[John Oxley]] took a party of 30 convicts and established a penal colony at Redcliffe. Known as the Moreton Bay Settlement, this later moved to the site now called Brisbane. The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were dictatorial and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded.

On 10 March<ref name=hill/> the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La P\u00e9rouse never met. La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men, women and children and the number included four companies of marines. About 20% of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82.

The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England. Many ex-convicts and convicts on tickets of leave and conditional pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''10 December 1859''' \u2013 [[Queensland]] is [[Separation of Queensland|separated from New South Wales]].

The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.<ref name=\"moadoph.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. The reformist [[Attorney General of New South Wales|attorney general]], [[John Plunkett]], sought to apply [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to [[emancipist]]s, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded. In [[Tasmania]], the \"[[Black War]]\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\n== Representations in literature and film ==\n* [[Marcus Clarke]]'s 1874 novel, ''[[For the Term of his Natural Life]]'', and the 1983 television adaptation of the novel.\n* [[Eleanor Dark]]'s 1947 ''Timeless Land'' trilogy, which spans the colonisation from 1788\u20131811.

The ''[[Good Schools Guide]]'', a guide to schools in the [[UK]], states \"Charitable grant-making trusts can help in cases of genuine need,\" and goes on to outline several instances where this may be the case, including an \"unforeseen family disaster\" and a \"need for special education\".\n* '''Community foundations:''' Many counties and cities and regions have a local foundation dedicated to giving money in the form of grants and scholarships to people and organizations in the area.\n* '''Music teachers:''' Some music teachers offer reduced-cost or free lessons to help low-income children gain access to an arts education.

Even if they do not offer any themselves, one can usually get a listing of members, and many of them may offer small scholarships to local students.\n* '''Other volunteer organizations:''' Many organizations offer scholarships or award grants to students whose background or chosen field overlaps the field of the organization. For example, local chapters of professional societies may help the studies of exceptionally distinguished students of the region. Similarly, charity organizations may offer help, especially if the late parent of the student was a member of the organization (e.g., a Masonic lodge might help the orphan of a lodge brother.) This kind of scholarship is mostly ad hoc.\n* '''School:''' Old, well-known [[schools]] are often endowed with scholarship funds.\n* '''University:''' Old, well-established [[universities]] may have funds to finance the studies of extremely talented students of little means. Eligibility often requires that a student belong to some special category or be among a nation's best. However, universities provide information on scholarships and grants, possibly even internship opportunities.\n* '''PSAT/NMSQT:''' In the United States, students are offered the opportunity to take the [[PSAT/NMSQT]] test, usually in their junior year of high school. National Merit Scholarship programs are initially determined by the scores received on the PSAT/NMSQT test. Some private scholarship programs require applicants to take the PSAT.

Scholarships may have a financial need component but rely on other criteria as well.\n\n* Academic scholarships typically use a minimum Grade Point Average or standardized test score such as the ACT or SAT to select awardees.\n* Athletic scholarships are generally based on athletic performance of a student and used as a tool to recruit high-performing athletes for their school's athletic teams.\n* Merit scholarships can be based on a number of criteria, including performance in a particular school subject or club participation or community service.\n\nGrants, however, are offered based exclusively on financial need and determined using the applicant's [[FAFSA]] information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholarships.com/resources/parents-practical-guide-to-college/parents-guide-to-college-financial-aid/loans-vs-grants-vs-scholarships/|title=Loans Vs Grants Vs Scholarships - Scholarships.com|last=Scholarships.com|website=www.scholarships.com|access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Admiral hands out scholarship money DVIDS319434.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Navy Rear Admiral presents a Midshipman with a ceremonial cheque symbolizing her $180,000 Navy Reserve Officers Training Candidate scholarship.]]\nThe most common scholarships may be classified as:\n* '''Merit-based:''' These awards are based on a student's academic, artistic, athletic or other abilities, and often factor in an applicant's extracurricular activities and community service record. The most common merit-based scholarships, awarded by either private organizations or directly by a student's intended college, recognize academic achievement or high scores on [[standardized test]]s.  Most such merit-based scholarships are paid directly by the institution the student attends, rather than issued directly to the student.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schoolgrantsguide.net/college-scholarship/|title=College Scholarship|publisher=School Grants Guide|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Need-based:''' Some private need-based awards are confusingly called scholarships, and require the results of a FAFSA (the family's EFC). However, scholarships are often merit-based, while grants tend to be need-based.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/grants-for-college/|title=The Complete Guide to College Grants|first1=Teddy|last1=Nykiel|first2=Anna|last2=Helhoski|date=24 June 2016|website=NerdWallet}}</ref>\n* '''Student-specific:''' These are scholarships for which applicants must initially qualify based upon gender, race, religion, family, and medical history, or many other student-specific factors.

Many schools in the United States give future nurses full scholarships to enter the field, especially if the student intends to work in a high-need community.\n* '''College-specific:''' College-specific scholarships are offered by individual colleges and universities to highly qualified applicants. These scholarships are given on the basis of academic and personal achievement.

Some academic scholarships take into account musical skills, particularly if they are needed in the scholl's orchestra or [[marching band]].

Furthermore, last dollar scholarships may require families to have filed taxes for the most recent year; received their other sources of financial aid; and not yet received loans.\n\n==Local==\n\nIt is typical for people to find scholarships in their home regions. Information on these can be found by asking local institutions and [[organizations]]. Typically, these are less competitive as the eligible population is smaller.\n* '''Guidance counselors:''' When starting to explore scholarship opportunities, most high school students check with their guidance counselors. They can be a reliable source of information regarding local scholarships.\n* '''Non-profits and charitable trusts:''' Most non-profit organizations have at some point of their history founded scholarships for prospective students. The ''[[Good Schools Guide]]'', a guide to schools in the [[UK]], states \"Charitable grant-making trusts can help in cases of genuine need,\" and goes on to outline several instances where this may be the case, including an \"unforeseen family disaster\" and a \"need for special education\".\n* '''Community foundations:''' Many counties and cities and regions have a local foundation dedicated to giving money in the form of grants and scholarships to people and organizations in the area.\n* '''Music teachers:''' Some music teachers offer reduced-cost or free lessons to help low-income children gain access to an arts education. In addition, some local non-profits provide free music classes to youths.\n* '''Foundations:''' Certain foundations in the United States and all over the world offer scholarships for entrepreneurial endeavors.\n* '''Labor/trade unions:''' Major [[trade union|union]]s often offer scholarships for members and their dependent children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-scholarship-coach/2014/08/28/organize-scholarship-support-from-a-labor-union|title=Organize Scholarship Support From a Labor Union|last=Konrad|first=Matt|date=August 28, 2014|website=US News|access-date=November 8, 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Houses of worship:''' The local [[house of worship]] may or may not have any scholarships for their members, but the religious organization or headquarters may have some available. [[Theology]] study is highly encouraged.\nFoundations\nReputable foundations formed by different individuals, company or organisation can fund a scholarship as a means of reaching out to people \n* '''Chamber of commerce:''' Many [[chambers of commerce]] offer (usually small) grants to students in the community, especially those planning on careers in business and public service. Even if they do not offer any themselves, one can usually get a listing of members, and many of them may offer small scholarships to local students.\n* '''Other volunteer organizations:''' Many organizations offer scholarships or award grants to students whose background or chosen field overlaps the field of the organization. For example, local chapters of professional societies may help the studies of exceptionally distinguished students of the region. Similarly, charity organizations may offer help, especially if the late parent of the student was a member of the organization (e.g., a Masonic lodge might help the orphan of a lodge brother.) This kind of scholarship is mostly ad hoc.\n* '''School:''' Old, well-known [[schools]] are often endowed with scholarship funds.\n* '''University:''' Old, well-established [[universities]] may have funds to finance the studies of extremely talented students of little means. Eligibility often requires that a student belong to some special category or be among a nation's best. However, universities provide information on scholarships and grants, possibly even internship opportunities.\n* '''PSAT/NMSQT:''' In the United States, students are offered the opportunity to take the [[PSAT/NMSQT]] test, usually in their junior year of high school. National Merit Scholarship programs are initially determined by the scores received on the PSAT/NMSQT test. Some private scholarship programs require applicants to take the PSAT.

Scholars have noted several important themes in the novel: the impact of heredity on behavior; racial superiority; civilization, especially as Tarzan struggles with his identity as a human; sexuality; and escapism.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJohn and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888.  Some time later, their son John Clayton II <ref>Tarzan of the Apes, Chapter XXV, where the following line (a diary entry by John Clayton, Tarzan's father) appears: \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them.  They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.  Tarzan's cousin, [[William Cecil Clayton]], unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men.  In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUczCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT95|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure|last=Lupoff|first=Richard A.|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781473208711|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characters in order of appearance==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*John Clayton, Earl of Greystoke\n*Alice Clayton (Rutherford), Countess of Greystoke\n*Captain Billings\n*Black Michael\n*Kerchak\n*Kala\n*Tarzan (a. k. a.

Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklop\u010di\u0107, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan's heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan's escapist appeal.\n\n=== Heredity ===\nBurroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a ''[[Writer's Digest|Writer\u2019s Digest]],'' \"I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14|title=Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan|last1=Taliaferro|first1=John|date=1999|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-83359-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14 14]}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents\u2019 cabin and the objects which he finds there.<ref name=\":0\" />  He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Jeff|date=1999|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Literature|volume=27|issue=1|page=63|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011}}</ref>  Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills.

She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the \"black rapist\" stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of African descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oklop\u010di\u0107|first=Biljana|date=|title=Adapting the Adapted: Adapting the Adapted: The Black Rapist Myth in E.R. Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes and Its Film Adaptations|url=|journal=Anafora|volume=4|pages=318, 321|via=}}</ref>\n\nCatherine Jurca similarly analyzes Tarzan as opposed to tolerating the presence of people of other races and classes in favor of preserving his own culture. The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents\u2019 home, from the \"savages\" who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jurca|first=Catherine|date=1996|title=Tarzan, Lord of the Suburbs|url=|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|volume=57|issue=3|pages=483|doi=10.1215/00267929-57-3-479}}</ref>\n\nThough Burroughs\u2019 admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote that ''Tarzan'' is the story of the \"whiteman\u2019s conquest of African savagery\", where the native Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newsinger|first=John|date=October 1, 1986|title=Lord Greystoke and Darkest Africa: the politics of the Tarzan stories|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=XXVIII|issue=2|pages=61\u201364|doi=10.1177/030639688602800204}}</ref>\n\n=== Civilization ===\nTarzan's jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan's ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs' portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan's growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Jeff|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Fiction|volume=27|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, \"[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable\" in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tukhanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=32|via=}}</ref> Humans mistake apes for other humans,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=35|via=}}</ref> an ape tries to rape Jane,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=37|via=}}</ref> Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape,<ref name=\":5\" /> and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=38|via=}}</ref> Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=43|via=}}</ref>  For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies \u201cqueer ethics,\u201d encouraging \u201cperverse sexuality\u201d along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=48, 33|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nJ. Michelle Coughlan argues that Tarzan displays behavior which seems outside of the bounds of traditional manhood in her article \"Absolutely Punk: Queer Economies of Desire in ''Tarzan of the Apes''.\" Coughlan analyzes Burroughs' fans complaints regarding the 'punk ending\" in order to prove that contemporary readers understood Tarzan's renunciation of Jane as unmanly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers: From Charlotte Temple to The DaVinci Code|last=Coughlan|first=J.

The first two were the silent films ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918) and ''[[The Romance of Tarzan]]'' (1918), both starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] as Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation was ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' (1932), starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced by [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]] (the character in the films). It was remade twice, as ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1959)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1959), featuring Denny Miller, and ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), with [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Tarzan and [[Bo Derek]] as Jane.\n\nThe 1935 12-part serial, ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', starred Herman Brix (later, \"[[Bruce Bennett]]\"). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.\n\nFour more movie adaptations have been made to date: ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'' (1984), a film starring [[Christopher Lambert]] that is more faithful to the book; ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1999 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1999), a direct-to-video animated film; ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), a Disney animated film with [[Tony Goldwyn]] as the voice of Tarzan; and ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2016), a more historically contextualized update starring [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] and [[Margot Robbie]], as well as [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian Captain [[L\u00e9on Rom]] and American Civil War soldier [[George Washington Williams]], respectively.\n\nA number of Burroughs' other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen.  Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.\n\n===Comic adaptations===\nThe book has been adapted into [[Tarzan (comics)|comic]] form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan [[comic strip]] and [[comic book]]s. The strip itself began with [[Hal Foster]]'s adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those of [[Gold Key Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' no. 155 (script by [[Gaylord DuBois]], art by [[Russ Manning]]), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969), [[DC Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' nos. 207-210, dated April\u2013July 1972, and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in ''Tarzan Super Special'' no. 1 (reprinted in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' nos. 1-2, dated July\u2013August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and former ''Tarzan'' comic strip artist [[Burne Hogarth]]'s 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novel ''Tarzan of the Apes''. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novel ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs' [[Jungle Tales of Tarzan|identically titled collection]] of Tarzan stories). [[Dynamite Entertainment]] adapted the story for the first six issues of ''Lord of the Jungle'', albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen.\n\n===Radio adaptations===\n''See main article, ''[[Tarzan (radio program)]]''.''\n\nThree [[old-time radio]] series were based on the Tarzan character. Burroughs himself revised each script in the 1932-1934 series as needed for accuracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stebbins|first1=Barton A.|title=\"Tarzan\": A Modern Radio Success Story|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/33-OCR/1933-01-15-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 15, 1933|page=7}}</ref> That series had Burroughs' daughter, Joan, in the role of Jane.<ref name=\"bc121532\">{{cite news|title=\"Tarzan\" Series Tests Produce 93,000 Letters In First Eight Weeks|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/32-OCR/1932-12-15-BC-OCR-Page-0013.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=December 15, 1932|page=13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bleiler | first=Everett | authorlink=Everett F.

Scholars have noted several important themes in the novel: the impact of heredity on behavior; racial superiority; civilization, especially as Tarzan struggles with his identity as a human; sexuality; and escapism.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJohn and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888.  Some time later, their son John Clayton II <ref>Tarzan of the Apes, Chapter XXV, where the following line (a diary entry by John Clayton, Tarzan's father) appears: \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them.  They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.  Tarzan's cousin, [[William Cecil Clayton]], unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men.  In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUczCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT95|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure|last=Lupoff|first=Richard A.|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781473208711|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characters in order of appearance==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*John Clayton, Earl of Greystoke\n*Alice Clayton (Rutherford), Countess of Greystoke\n*Captain Billings\n*Black Michael\n*Kerchak\n*Kala\n*Tarzan (a. k. a.

Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklop\u010di\u0107, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan's heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan's escapist appeal.\n\n=== Heredity ===\nBurroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a ''[[Writer's Digest|Writer\u2019s Digest]],'' \"I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14|title=Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan|last1=Taliaferro|first1=John|date=1999|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0-684-83359-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tarzanforeverlif00tali/page/14 14]}}</ref>\n\nThe scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents\u2019 cabin and the objects which he finds there.<ref name=\":0\" />  He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Jeff|date=1999|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Literature|volume=27|issue=1|page=63|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011}}</ref>  Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, and he himself eats ape corpses, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills.

She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the \"black rapist\" stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of African descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oklop\u010di\u0107|first=Biljana|date=|title=Adapting the Adapted: Adapting the Adapted: The Black Rapist Myth in E.R. Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes and Its Film Adaptations|url=|journal=Anafora|volume=4|pages=318, 321|via=}}</ref>\n\nCatherine Jurca similarly analyzes Tarzan as opposed to tolerating the presence of people of other races and classes in favor of preserving his own culture. The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents\u2019 home, from the \"savages\" who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jurca|first=Catherine|date=1996|title=Tarzan, Lord of the Suburbs|url=|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|volume=57|issue=3|pages=483|doi=10.1215/00267929-57-3-479}}</ref>\n\nThough Burroughs\u2019 admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote that ''Tarzan'' is the story of the \"whiteman\u2019s conquest of African savagery\", where the native Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newsinger|first=John|date=October 1, 1986|title=Lord Greystoke and Darkest Africa: the politics of the Tarzan stories|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=XXVIII|issue=2|pages=61\u201364|doi=10.1177/030639688602800204}}</ref>\n\n=== Civilization ===\nTarzan's jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan's ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs' portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan's growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Jeff|title=Write, Right, White, Rite: Literacy, Imperialism, Race, and Cannibalism in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes|journal=Studies in American Fiction|volume=27|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1353/saf.1999.0011|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, \"[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable\" in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tukhanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=32|via=}}</ref> Humans mistake apes for other humans,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=35|via=}}</ref> an ape tries to rape Jane,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=37|via=}}</ref> Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape,<ref name=\":5\" /> and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=38|via=}}</ref> Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=43|via=}}</ref>  For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies \u201cqueer ethics,\u201d encouraging \u201cperverse sexuality\u201d along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuhkanen|first=Mikko|date=|title=Grotesquely Becoming: Tarzan's Queer Hominization|url=|journal=Diacritics|volume=44|pages=48, 33|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nJ. Michelle Coughlan argues that Tarzan displays behavior which seems outside of the bounds of traditional manhood in her article \"Absolutely Punk: Queer Economies of Desire in ''Tarzan of the Apes''.\" Coughlan analyzes Burroughs' fans complaints regarding the 'punk ending\" in order to prove that contemporary readers understood Tarzan's renunciation of Jane as unmanly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers: From Charlotte Temple to The DaVinci Code|last=Coughlan|first=J.

The first two were the silent films ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918) and ''[[The Romance of Tarzan]]'' (1918), both starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] as Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation was ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' (1932), starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced by [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]] (the character in the films). It was remade twice, as ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1959)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1959), featuring Denny Miller, and ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), with [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Tarzan and [[Bo Derek]] as Jane.\n\nThe 1935 12-part serial, ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', starred Herman Brix (later, \"[[Bruce Bennett]]\"). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.\n\nFour more movie adaptations have been made to date: ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'' (1984), a film starring [[Christopher Lambert]] that is more faithful to the book; ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1999 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1999), a direct-to-video animated film; ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), a Disney animated film with [[Tony Goldwyn]] as the voice of Tarzan; and ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2016), a more historically contextualized update starring [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] and [[Margot Robbie]], as well as [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian Captain [[L\u00e9on Rom]] and American Civil War soldier [[George Washington Williams]], respectively.\n\nA number of Burroughs' other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen.  Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.\n\n===Comic adaptations===\nThe book has been adapted into [[Tarzan (comics)|comic]] form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan [[comic strip]] and [[comic book]]s. The strip itself began with [[Hal Foster]]'s adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those of [[Gold Key Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' no. 155 (script by [[Gaylord DuBois]], art by [[Russ Manning]]), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969), [[DC Comics]] in ''Tarzan'' nos. 207-210, dated April\u2013July 1972, and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in ''Tarzan Super Special'' no. 1 (reprinted in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' nos. 1-2, dated July\u2013August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and former ''Tarzan'' comic strip artist [[Burne Hogarth]]'s 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novel ''Tarzan of the Apes''. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novel ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs' [[Jungle Tales of Tarzan|identically titled collection]] of Tarzan stories). [[Dynamite Entertainment]] adapted the story for the first six issues of ''Lord of the Jungle'', albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen.\n\n===Radio adaptations===\n''See main article, ''[[Tarzan (radio program)]]''.''\n\nThree [[old-time radio]] series were based on the Tarzan character. Burroughs himself revised each script in the 1932-1934 series as needed for accuracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stebbins|first1=Barton A.|title=\"Tarzan\": A Modern Radio Success Story|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/33-OCR/1933-01-15-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 15, 1933|page=7}}</ref> That series had Burroughs' daughter, Joan, in the role of Jane.<ref name=\"bc121532\">{{cite news|title=\"Tarzan\" Series Tests Produce 93,000 Letters In First Eight Weeks|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/32-OCR/1932-12-15-BC-OCR-Page-0013.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=December 15, 1932|page=13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bleiler | first=Everett | authorlink=Everett F.
