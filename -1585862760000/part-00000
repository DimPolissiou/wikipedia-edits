In 2017, she announced her engagement to [[Prince Harry]], grandson of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], and she moved to London.

In that case, it may be useful to distinguish the resultant force from the net force. And even in the case of non-rigid objects (deformable bodies or systems), the concepts of net and resultant force are equally applicable to description of their overall motion.\n\nSome authors use \"resultant force\" and \"net force\" as synonyms, even when the forces act on extended bodies.

The result can be approximately evaluated from the diagram or, based on the diagram, precisely calculated using elementary [[trigonometry]].\n ----><!----\n  This is not an alternative to the parallelogram rule, it -is- the parallelogram rule:\n\nInstead of using the parallelogram rule, the same result can be obtained by a simpler procedure (shown on the right side of the diagram). The line segments representing the original forces can be translated (in any order) so that one begins where the other ends. The same result for the vector sum is the line drawn from the beginning of the first segment to the end of the second&nbsp;\u2013 or to the end of the last one&nbsp;\u2013 which enables simple addition of more than two vectors. At the bottom of the diagram, this procedure is applied to the addition of two parallel and antiparallel forces, leading to the intuitively expected result: for parallel forces the amounts add up, whereas for the forces in opposite directions (antiparallel) the amount of the smaller force is subtracted from the bigger one.\n ---->\n\nForces applied to an extended body can have different points of application.  Forces are bound vectors and can be added only if they are applied at the same point.  The net force obtained from all the forces acting on a body  do not preserve its motion unless applied at the same point, and with the appropriate torque associated with the new point of application determined.  The net force on a body applied at a single point with the appropriate torque is known as the [[resultant force]] and torque.\n\n== Parallelogram rule for the addition of forces ==\n[[File:Parallelogram1.svg|right|Parallelogram ABCD]]\n\nA force is known as a bound vector\u2014which means it has a direction and magnitude and a point of application.  A convenient way to define a force is by a line segment from a point ''A'' to a point ''B''.  If we denote the coordinates of these points as '''A'''=(A<sub>x</sub>, A<sub>y</sub>, A<sub>z</sub>) and  '''B'''=(B<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>y</sub>, B<sub>z</sub>), then the force vector applied at ''A'' is given by\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}= \\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{A} = (B_x-A_x, B_y-A_y, B_z-A_z). </math>\nThe length of the vector '''B'''-'''A''' defines the magnitude of '''F''' and is given by\n: <math> |\\mathbf{F}| = \\sqrt{(B_x-A_x)^2+(B_y-A_y)^2+(B_z-A_z)^2}. </math>\n\nThe sum of two forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub> and  '''F'''<sub>2</sub> applied at ''A'' can be computed from the sum of the segments that define them.  Let '''F'''<sub>1</sub>='''B'''-'''A''' and '''F'''<sub>2</sub>='''D'''-'''A''', then the sum of these two vectors is\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_1+\\mathbf{F}_2 = \\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{A},</math>\nwhich can be written as\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_1+\\mathbf{F}_2 = 2(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{D}}{2}-\\mathbf{A})=2(\\mathbf{E}-\\mathbf{A}),</math>\nwhere '''E''' is the midpoint of the segment '''BD''' that joins the points ''B'' and ''D''.  \n\nThus, the sum of the forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub> and '''F'''<sub>2</sub> is twice the segment joining ''A'' to the midpoint ''E'' of the segment joining the endpoints ''B'' and ''D'' of the two forces.  The doubling of this length is easily achieved by defining a segments '''BC''' and '''DC''' parallel to '''AD''' and '''AB''', respectively, to complete the parallelogram ''ABCD''.  The diagonal '''AC''' of this parallelogram is the sum of the two force vectors.  This is known as the parallelogram rule for the addition of forces.\n\n== Translation and rotation due to a force ==\n\n===Point forces===\nWhen a force acts on a particle, it is applied to a single point (the particle volume is negligible): this is a point force and the particle is its application point. But an external force on an extended body (object) can be applied to a number of its constituent particles, i.e. can be \"spread\" over some volume or surface of the body. However, determining its rotational effect on the body requires that we specify its point of application (actually, the line of application, as explained below). The problem is usually resolved in the following ways:\n\n* Often, the volume or surface on which the force acts is relatively small compared to the size of the body, so that it can be approximated by a point. It is usually not difficult to determine whether the error caused by such approximation is acceptable.\n* If it is not acceptable (obviously e.g. in the case of gravitational force), such \"volume/surface\" force should be described as a system of forces (components), each acting on a single particle, and then the calculation should be done for each of them separately. Such a calculation is typically simplified by the use of differential elements of the body volume/surface, and the integral calculus. In a number of cases, though, it can be shown that such a system of forces may be replaced by a single point force without the actual calculation (as in the case of uniform gravitational force).\n\nIn any case, the analysis of the rigid body motion begins with the point force model. And when a force acting on a body is shown graphically, the oriented line segment representing the force is usually drawn so as to \"begin\" (or \"end\") at the application point.\n\n===Rigid bodies===\n[[File:Free body acceleration.JPG|thumb|300px|How a force accelerates a body.]]\nIn the example shown in the diagram opposite, a single force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> acts at the application point '''H''' on a free rigid body. The body has the mass <math>\\scriptstyle m </math> and its center of mass is the point '''C'''. In the constant mass approximation, the force causes changes in the body motion described by the following expressions:\n\n: <math> \\vec a = {\\vec F \\over m} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the center of mass acceleration; and\n\n: <math> \\vec \\alpha = {\\vec \\tau \\over I} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body.\n\nIn the second expression, <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec \\tau </math> is the [[torque]] or moment of force, whereas <math>\\scriptstyle I </math> is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. A torque caused by a force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> is a vector quantity defined with respect to some reference point:\n\n:<math> \\vec \\tau = \\vec r \\times \\vec F </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the torque vector, and\n\n:<math> \\ \\tau = Fk </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the amount of torque.\n\nThe vector <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r </math> is the [[position vector]] of the force application point, and in this example it is drawn from the center of mass as the reference point of (see diagram). The straight line segment <math>\\scriptstyle k </math> is the lever arm of the force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> with respect to the center of mass. As the illustration suggests, the torque does not change (the same lever arm) if the application point is moved along the line of the application of the force (dotted black line). More formally, this follows from the properties of the vector product, and shows that rotational effect of the force depends only on the position of its line of application, and not on the particular choice of the point of application along that line.\n\nThe torque vector is perpendicular to the plane defined by the force and the vector <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r </math>, and in this example it is directed towards the observer; the angular acceleration vector has the same direction. The [[right hand rule]] relates this direction to the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation in the plane of the drawing.\n\nThe moment of inertia <math>\\scriptstyle I </math> is calculated with respect to the axis through the center of mass that is parallel with the torque. If the body shown in the illustration is a homogeneous disc, this moment of inertia is <math>\\scriptstyle I=m r^2 /2 </math> . If the disc has the mass 0,5&nbsp;kg and the radius 0,8 m, the moment of inertia is 0,16 kgm<sup>2</sup>. If the amount of force is 2 N, and the lever arm 0,6 m, the amount of torque is 1,2 Nm. At the instant shown, the force gives to the disc the angular acceleration \u03b1 = {{math|''\u03c4''}}/I = 7,5 rad/s<sup>2</sup>, and to its center of mass it gives the linear acceleration a&nbsp;= F/m&nbsp;= 4&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>.\n\n== Resultant force ==\n[[File:Rezultanta.JPG|thumb|500px|Graphical placing of the resultant force.]]\n\n[[Resultant force]] and torque replaces the effects of a system of forces acting on the movement of a rigid body.  An interesting special case is a torque-free resultant, which can be found as follows:\n# Vector addition is used to find the net force;\n# Use the equation to determine the point of application with zero torque:\n:<math> \\vec r \\times \\vec F_\\mathrm{R} = \\sum_{i=1}^N ( \\vec r_i \\times \\vec F_i ) </math>\nwhere <math> \\vec F_\\mathrm{R} </math> is the net force, <math> \\vec r</math> locates its application point, and individual forces are <math> \\vec F_i </math> with application points <math> \\vec r_i </math>.  It may be that there is no point of application that yields a torque-free resultant.\n<!----\n  This paragraph confuse[s?] a resultant force and torque with a torque-free resultant:\n\nThe above equation may have no solution for <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r</math>. In that case, there is no resultant force, i.e. no single force can replace all actual forces regarding both linear and angular acceleration of the body. And even when <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r</math> can be calculated, it is not unique, because the point of application can move along the line of application without affecting the torque.\n ---->\n\nThe diagram opposite illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems:\n# Lines of application of the actual forces <math>\\vec{F}_{1}</math> and <math>\\vec{F}_{2}</math> on the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed \"at the location of <math> \\vec{F}_{1}</math>\", the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force <math>\\vec{F}_\\mathrm{R}</math> is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.\n# The illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition \"at the location of <math>\\vec{F}_{2}</math>\", the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, where it becomes the resultant force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{F}_\\mathrm{R}</math>. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.\n# The rightmost illustration shows a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque <math> \\scriptstyle \\tau = Fd </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where <math> \\scriptstyle \\ d </math>&nbsp; is the distance between their lines of application. Since there is no resultant force, this torque can be [is?] described as \"pure\" torque.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Non-parallel net force.svg|thumb|279px|Vector diagram for addition of non-parallel forces.]]\n\nIn general, a system of forces acting on a rigid body can always be replaced by one force plus one pure (see previous section) torque. The force is the net force, but to calculate the additional torque, the net force must be assigned the line of action. The line of action can be selected arbitrarily, but the additional pure torque depends on this choice. In a special case, it is possible to find such line of action that this additional torque is zero.\n\nThe [[resultant force]] and torque can be determined for any configuration of forces.  However, an interesting special case is a torque-free resultant. This is useful, both conceptually and practically, because the body moves without rotating as if it was a particle.\n<!----\n  These paragraphs [This paragraph?] seems to be redundant:\n\nWhen the system of forces can be replaced by a resultant force, this can simplify practical calculations (e.g. in many planar systems, or using the center of gravity in homogenous field, etc.). On the conceptual level, definition of the resultant force underlines the fact that the net force does not fully replace the system of forces (so, for example, the [[work physics|work]] of the net force cannot replace the net work in the case of an extended rigid body, e.g. in the work-energy theorem etc.). And the concept is also useful for a full understanding of a more general approach.\n\n[[File:Parallel net force.svg|thumb|185px|Vector diagram for addition of parallel forces.]]\n ---->\n\nSome authors do not distinguish the resultant force from the net force and use the terms as [[synonym]]s.<ref>Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), Physics, (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Screw theory]]\n* [[Center of mass]]\n* [[Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Force]]\n[[Category:Dynamics (mechanics)]]\n", "text_old": "Net force is the [[vector sum]] of forces acting on a particle or body.

If we denote the coordinates of these points as '''A'''=(A<sub>x</sub>, A<sub>y</sub>, A<sub>z</sub>) and  '''B'''=(B<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>y</sub>, B<sub>z</sub>), then the force vector applied at ''A'' is given by\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}= \\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{A} = (B_x-A_x, B_y-A_y, B_z-A_z). </math>\nThe length of the vector '''B'''-'''A''' defines the magnitude of '''F''' and is given by\n: <math> |\\mathbf{F}| = \\sqrt{(B_x-A_x)^2+(B_y-A_y)^2+(B_z-A_z)^2}. </math>\n\nThe sum of two forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub> and  '''F'''<sub>2</sub> applied at ''A'' can be computed from the sum of the segments that define them.  Let '''F'''<sub>1</sub>='''B'''-'''A''' and '''F'''<sub>2</sub>='''D'''-'''A''', then the sum of these two vectors is\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_1+\\mathbf{F}_2 = \\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{A},</math>\nwhich can be written as\n: <math> \\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_1+\\mathbf{F}_2 = 2(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{D}}{2}-\\mathbf{A})=2(\\mathbf{E}-\\mathbf{A}),</math>\nwhere '''E''' is the midpoint of the segment '''BD''' that joins the points ''B'' and ''D''.  \n\nThus, the sum of the forces '''F'''<sub>1</sub> and '''F'''<sub>2</sub> is twice the segment joining ''A'' to the midpoint ''E'' of the segment joining the endpoints ''B'' and ''D'' of the two forces.  The doubling of this length is easily achieved by defining a segments '''BC''' and '''DC''' parallel to '''AD''' and '''AB''', respectively, to complete the parallelogram ''ABCD''.  The diagonal '''AC''' of this parallelogram is the sum of the two force vectors.  This is known as the parallelogram rule for the addition of forces.\n\n== Translation and rotation due to a force ==\n\n===Point forces===\nWhen a force acts on a particle, it is applied to a single point (the particle volume is negligible): this is a point force and the particle is its application point. But an external force on an extended body (object) can be applied to a number of its constituent particles, i.e. can be \"spread\" over some volume or surface of the body. However, determining its rotational effect on the body requires that we specify its point of application (actually, the line of application, as explained below). The problem is usually resolved in the following ways:\n\n* Often, the volume or surface on which the force acts is relatively small compared to the size of the body, so that it can be approximated by a point. It is usually not difficult to determine whether the error caused by such approximation is acceptable.\n* If it is not acceptable (obviously e.g. in the case of gravitational force), such \"volume/surface\" force should be described as a system of forces (components), each acting on a single particle, and then the calculation should be done for each of them separately. Such a calculation is typically simplified by the use of differential elements of the body volume/surface, and the integral calculus. In a number of cases, though, it can be shown that such a system of forces may be replaced by a single point force without the actual calculation (as in the case of uniform gravitational force).\n\nIn any case, the analysis of the rigid body motion begins with the point force model. And when a force acting on a body is shown graphically, the oriented line segment representing the force is usually drawn so as to \"begin\" (or \"end\") at the application point.\n\n===Rigid bodies===\n[[File:Free body acceleration.JPG|thumb|300px|How a force accelerates a body.]]\nIn the example shown in the diagram opposite, a single force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> acts at the application point '''H''' on a free rigid body. The body has the mass <math>\\scriptstyle m </math> and its center of mass is the point '''C'''. In the constant mass approximation, the force causes changes in the body motion described by the following expressions:\n\n: <math> \\vec a = {\\vec F \\over m} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the center of mass acceleration; and\n\n: <math> \\vec \\alpha = {\\vec \\tau \\over I} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body.\n\nIn the second expression, <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec \\tau </math> is the [[torque]] or moment of force, whereas <math>\\scriptstyle I </math> is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. A torque caused by a force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> is a vector quantity defined with respect to some reference point:\n\n:<math> \\vec \\tau = \\vec r \\times \\vec F </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the torque vector, and\n\n:<math> \\ \\tau = Fk </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the amount of torque.\n\nThe vector <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r </math> is the [[position vector]] of the force application point, and in this example it is drawn from the center of mass as the reference point of (see diagram). The straight line segment <math>\\scriptstyle k </math> is the lever arm of the force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec F </math> with respect to the center of mass. As the illustration suggests, the torque does not change (the same lever arm) if the application point is moved along the line of the application of the force (dotted black line). More formally, this follows from the properties of the vector product, and shows that rotational effect of the force depends only on the position of its line of application, and not on the particular choice of the point of application along that line.\n\nThe torque vector is perpendicular to the plane defined by the force and the vector <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r </math>, and in this example it is directed towards the observer; the angular acceleration vector has the same direction. The [[right hand rule]] relates this direction to the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation in the plane of the drawing.\n\nThe moment of inertia <math>\\scriptstyle I </math> is calculated with respect to the axis through the center of mass that is parallel with the torque. If the body shown in the illustration is a homogeneous disc, this moment of inertia is <math>\\scriptstyle I=m r^2 /2 </math> . If the disc has the mass 0,5&nbsp;kg and the radius 0,8 m, the moment of inertia is 0,16 kgm<sup>2</sup>. If the amount of force is 2 N, and the lever arm 0,6 m, the amount of torque is 1,2 Nm. At the instant shown, the force gives to the disc the angular acceleration \u03b1 = {{math|''\u03c4''}}/I = 7,5 rad/s<sup>2</sup>, and to its center of mass it gives the linear acceleration a&nbsp;= F/m&nbsp;= 4&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>.\n\n== Resultant force ==\n[[File:Rezultanta.JPG|thumb|500px|Graphical placing of the resultant force.]]\n\n[[Resultant force]] and torque replaces the effects of a system of forces acting on the movement of a rigid body.  An interesting special case is a torque-free resultant, which can be found as follows:\n# Vector addition is used to find the net force;\n# Use the equation to determine the point of application with zero torque:\n:<math> \\vec r \\times \\vec F_\\mathrm{R} = \\sum_{i=1}^N ( \\vec r_i \\times \\vec F_i ) </math>\nwhere <math> \\vec F_\\mathrm{R} </math> is the net force, <math> \\vec r</math> locates its application point, and individual forces are <math> \\vec F_i </math> with application points <math> \\vec r_i </math>.  It may be that there is no point of application that yields a torque-free resultant.\n<!----\n  This paragraph confuse[s?] a resultant force and torque with a torque-free resultant:\n\nThe above equation may have no solution for <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r</math>. In that case, there is no resultant force, i.e. no single force can replace all actual forces regarding both linear and angular acceleration of the body. And even when <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec r</math> can be calculated, it is not unique, because the point of application can move along the line of application without affecting the torque.\n ---->\n\nThe diagram opposite illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems:\n# Lines of application of the actual forces <math>\\vec{F}_{1}</math> and <math>\\vec{F}_{2}</math> on the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed \"at the location of <math> \\vec{F}_{1}</math>\", the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force <math>\\vec{F}_\\mathrm{R}</math> is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.\n# The illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition \"at the location of <math>\\vec{F}_{2}</math>\", the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, where it becomes the resultant force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{F}_\\mathrm{R}</math>. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.\n# The rightmost illustration shows a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque <math> \\scriptstyle \\tau = Fd </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where <math> \\scriptstyle \\ d </math>&nbsp; is the distance between their lines of application. Since there is no resultant force, this torque can be [is?] described as \"pure\" torque.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Non-parallel net force.svg|thumb|279px|Vector diagram for addition of non-parallel forces.]]\n\nIn general, a system of forces acting on a rigid body can always be replaced by one force plus one pure (see previous section) torque. The force is the net force, but to calculate the additional torque, the net force must be assigned the line of action. The line of action can be selected arbitrarily, but the additional pure torque depends on this choice. In a special case, it is possible to find such line of action that this additional torque is zero.\n\nThe [[resultant force]] and torque can be determined for any configuration of forces.  However, an interesting special case is a torque-free resultant. This is useful, both conceptually and practically, because the body moves without rotating as if it was a particle.\n<!----\n  These paragraphs [This paragraph?] seems to be redundant:\n\nWhen the system of forces can be replaced by a resultant force, this can simplify practical calculations (e.g. in many planar systems, or using the center of gravity in homogenous field, etc.). On the conceptual level, definition of the resultant force underlines the fact that the net force does not fully replace the system of forces (so, for example, the [[work physics|work]] of the net force cannot replace the net work in the case of an extended rigid body, e.g. in the work-energy theorem etc.). And the concept is also useful for a full understanding of a more general approach.\n\n[[File:Parallel net force.svg|thumb|185px|Vector diagram for addition of parallel forces.]]\n ---->\n\nSome authors do not distinguish the resultant force from the net force and use the terms as [[synonym]]s.<ref>Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), Physics, (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Screw theory]]\n* [[Center of mass]]\n* [[Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Force]]\n[[Category:Dynamics (mechanics)]]\n", "name_user": "2601:3c7:8300:6830:b59e:4f51:dc29:ee4c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_force"}

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

The adult has yellow-orange-red legs, a black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black stripe running along the breast line. This chest band is usually thicker in males during the breeding season, and it is the only reliable way to tell the sexes apart. The bird is difficult to see when it is standing still, as it blends well with open, sandy beach habitats. It typically runs in short spurts and stops.\n\nThere are two subspecies of piping plovers: the eastern population is known as ''Charadrius melodus melodus'' and the mid-west population is known as ''C. m. circumcinctus''. The bird's name is derived from its plaintive bell-like whistles which are often heard before the bird is visible.\n\nTotal population is currently estimated at about 6,510 individuals. A preliminary estimate showed 3,350 birds in 2003 on the Atlantic Coast alone, 52% of the total.<ref name=BirdLife/> The population has been increasing since 1999.\n\nTheir breeding habitat includes [[beach]]es and sand flats on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, the shores of the [[Great Lakes]], and in the mid-west of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. They nest on [[sand]]y or gravel beaches or [[shoal]]s. These shorebirds forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving across the beaches in short bursts. Generally, piping plovers will forage for food around the high [[tide]] [[wrack zone]] and along the water's edge. They eat mainly [[insect]]s, [[marine worm]]s, and [[crustacean]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nAmerican naturalist [[George Ord]] described the piping plover in 1824. Two subspecies are recognized, including nominate ''C. m. melodus'' of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] and ''C. m. circumcinctus'' of the [[Great Plains]]. On average, ''circumcinctus'' is darker overall with more contrastingly dark cheeks and lores. Breeding male ''circumcinctuses'' show more extensive black on forehead and bill-base and more often shows complete breast-bands. Some overlap exists. All of this is lies. LIES I TELL YOU!! Email me at bullemma05@gmail.com.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Charadrius melodus -Cape May, New Jersey, USA -adult-8 (6).jpg|upright|left|thumb|On the Atlantic coast, Cape May, New Jersey, USA]]\nThe piping plover is a stout bird with a large rounded head, a short thick neck, and a stubby bill. It is a sand-colored, dull gray/khaki, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]-sized shorebird. The adult has yellow-orange legs, a black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black ring around the neck during the breeding season. During nonbreeding season, the black bands become less pronounced.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> Its bill is orange with a black tip. It ranges from {{convert|15|\u2013|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|35|\u2013|41|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|42|\u2013|64|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name= CRC/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nThe piping plover's light call is a soft, whistled ''peep peep'' given by standing and flying birds. Its frequently heard alarm call is a soft ''pee-werp'', which the second syllable lower pitched.\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\nThe piping plover lives the majority of its life on open sandy beaches or [[rocky shore]]s, often in high, dry sections away from water. They can be found on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] of the U.S. and Canada on the ocean or bay beaches and on the [[Great Lakes]] shores. It builds its nests higher on the shore near beach grass and other objects. It is very rare to see a piping plover anywhere outside of sand or rocky beaches/shores while not migrating. Piping plovers are often found to migrate south to The Bahamas during winter months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/magazine/november-december-2012/solving-piping-plover-puzzle|title=Solving the Piping Plover Puzzle|author=|date=12 October 2012|website=audubon.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPiping plovers [[bird migration|migrate]] from their northern range in the summer to the south in the winter months, migrating to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the southern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the United States and the [[Caribbean]]. They begin migrating north beginning in mid-March. Their breeding grounds extend from southern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] south to the northern parts of [[South Carolina]].<ref name=FWS/> Migration south begins in August for some adults and fledglings, and by mid-September most piping plovers have headed south for winter.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Charadrius melodus -Cape May, New Jersey, USA -parent and chick-8 (1).jpg|right|thumb|Parent and chick on the Atlantic coast, Cape May, New Jersey, USA]]\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Plover Chick.JPG|thumbnail|Piping plover chick at two days old.]]\n[[File:Charadrius-melodus-002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Piping plover chick with [[Bird ringing|band]] at two weeks old.]]\nThe piping plover usually arrives at sandy beaches to breed in mid to late April.<ref name=\"Cairns1982\">{{cite journal|last=Cairns|first=Winifred E.|title=Biology and behavior of breeding piping plovers|year=1982|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=94|issue=4|pages=531\u2013545}}</ref>\n\nMales will begin claiming territories and pairing up in late March. When pairs are formed, the male begins digging out several scrapes ([[bird nest|nests]]) along the high shore near the beach-grass line. The males also perform elaborate courtship ceremonies, including stone tossing and courtship flights featuring repeated dives.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> Scrapes, small depressions in the sand dug by kicking the sand, are often in the same area that [[least tern]]s choose to colonize. Females will sit and evaluate the scrapes, then choose a good scrape and decorate the nest with shells and debris to [[camouflage]] it. Once a scrape is seen as sufficient, the female will allow the male to copulate with her. The male begins a mating ritual of standing upright and \"marching\" towards the female, puffing himself up and quickly stomping his legs. If the female had seen the scrape as adequate, she will allow the male to stand on her back and [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] occurs within a few minutes.\n\nMost first-time nest attempts in each breeding season are four-egg nests which appear as early as mid-to-late April. Females lay one egg every other day. Second, third and sometimes fourth nesting attempts may have only three or two eggs. Incubation of the nest is shared by both the male and the female. Incubation is generally 27 days and eggs usually all hatch on the same day.\n\nAfter chicks hatch, they are able to feed within hours. The adults' role is then to protect them from the elements by [[brooding]] them. They also alert them to any danger. Like many other species of plovers, adult piping plovers will often feign a \"[[Distraction display|broken wing display]]\", drawing attention to themselves and away from the chicks when a predator may be threatening the chicks' safety. The broken wing display is also used during the nesting period to distract predators from the nest.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> A major defense mechanism of the chicks is their ability to blend in with the sand. It takes about 30 days before chicks achieve flight capability. They must be able to fly at least {{convert|50|yards|m|abbr=on}} before they can be considered fledglings.\n\nTo protect the nests from predators during incubation, many conservationists use [[exclosure]]s, such as round turkey-wire cages with screened tops. These allow the adults to move in and out but stop predators from getting to the eggs. After the chicks hatch, many areas will put up snow fencing to restrict driving and pets for the safety of the chicks. Threats to nests include [[crow]]s, [[cat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[fox]]es, among others. Exclosures are not always used, as they occasionally draw more attention to the nest than would occur without the exclosure. Natural hazards to eggs or chicks include storms, high winds, and abnormal high tides; human disturbances can cause the abandonment of nests and chicks as well. It is best to stay away from any bird that appears distressed to prevent any [[unintended consequences]].\n\n==Status and conservation==\nThe piping plover is globally threatened and endangered; it is uncommon and local within its range, and has been listed by the United States as \"[[endangered]]\" in the [[Great Lakes]] region and \"[[threatened]]\" in the remainder of its breeding range.<ref name=FWS2/> While it is federally threatened, the piping plover has been listed as state endangered in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  The Parker River Refuge on Plum Island, Massachusetts is a national network of lands and rivers dedicated to the safety of its native wildlife and specifically the Piping Plover.  Protecting the Piper with full beach closures, the Refuge now \"has the second largest plover population on the North Shore\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/pipingploverFAQs2014.pdf#beach|format=PDF|title=The Piping Plover and Beach Closures at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge|website=Fws.gov|accessdate=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Canada, the piping plover is found only on coastal beaches. In 1985, it was declared an endangered species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.<ref name=EnvCan/> A large population in [[Ontario]] has disappeared entirely.<ref name=BIJ1/> In 2008, however, piping plover nests were found at [[Wasaga Beach]] and near [[Sauble Beach, Ontario]], along the Ontario Great Lakes shores.<ref name=ROM/> There is also some evidence of nesting at other sites in Ontario, including [[Port Elgin, Ontario]] in 2014.<ref name=AtlasON/><ref name=MNR/>\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, the piping plover was utilized for its feathers, as were many other birds at the time, as decorations for women's hats. These decorations, called plumes, became a symbol of high society, especially those from larger rare birds. This practice led to its initial population decline. The [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] helped the population recover through the 1930s.<ref name=\"state.nj.us\"/> The second decline in the piping plover's population and range has been attributed to increased development, shoreline stabilization efforts,<ref name=FWS3/> habitat loss and human activity near nesting sites in the decades following [[World War II]].<ref name=\"state.nj.us\"/> The Great Lakes populations eventually shrank to only around two dozen.<ref name=BIJ1/> On the Missouri River sandbars, the number of breeding individuals varied, with the population increasing from 2012 to 2017 following a major habitat creation event.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kelsi L.|last2=Gibson|first2=Daniel|last3=Friedrich|first3=Meryl J.|last4=Huber|first4=Coral J.|last5=Fraser|first5=James D.|last6=Karpanty|first6=Sarah M.|last7=Catlin|first7=Daniel H.|date=2020|title=Using nest captures and video cameras to estimate survival and abundance of breeding Piping Plovers Charadrius melodus|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12726|journal=Ibis|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1111/ibi.12726|issn=1474-919X}}</ref>\n\nCritical nesting habitats are now being protected to help the population during its breeding season. Populations have seen significant increases since the protection programs began, but the species remains in serious danger. Current conservation strategies include identification and preservation of known nesting sites; public education; limiting or preventing pedestrian and/or [[off-road vehicle]] (ORV) traffic near nests and hatched chicks; limiting predation of free-ranging cats, dogs and other pets on breeding pairs, eggs and chicks;<ref name=NatCons/> and removal of foxes, raccoons, skunks, and other predators.<ref name=FWS4/>\n\nIn coastal areas such as [[Plymouth Beach, Massachusetts|Plymouth]],<ref name=Plymouth/> [[Cape Cod]], [[Long Island]], [[Sandy Hook]],<ref name=gateway/> [[Cape Henlopen State Park]] in [[Delaware]], [[North Manitou Island]] in Lake Michigan, and most recently, [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], beach access to pedestrians and ORVs has been limited to protect piping plovers and their chicks at critical times of the breeding season.\n\nVarious environmental organizations are involved in aiding restoration efforts. The Goldenrod Foundation [http://www.goldenrod.org/] unsuccessfully filed suit against the Town of Plymouth in 2010 and 2015 to restrict offroad vehicle access to breeding habitat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/article/20101221/NEWS/312219852|title=Magistrate rules against Goldenrod Foundation on ORV ban|newspaper=Wicked Local Plymouth|date=21 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/article/20150321/NEWS/150329407|title=Court says cars and birds can coexist on Plymouth Long Beach|date=21 March 2015|newspaper=Wicked Local Plymouth}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the first documented pair of piping plovers in [[Chicago]] nested at Montrose Beach.

A preliminary estimate showed 3,350 birds in 2003 on the Atlantic Coast alone, 52% of the total.<ref name=BirdLife/> The population has been increasing since 1999.\n\nTheir breeding habitat includes [[beach]]es and sand flats on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, the shores of the [[Great Lakes]], and in the mid-west of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. They nest on [[sand]]y or gravel beaches or [[shoal]]s. These shorebirds forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving across the beaches in short bursts. Generally, piping plovers will forage for food around the high [[tide]] [[wrack zone]] and along the water's edge. They eat mainly [[insect]]s, [[marine worm]]s, and [[crustacean]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nAmerican naturalist [[George Ord]] described the piping plover in 1824. Two subspecies are recognized, including nominate ''C. m. melodus'' of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] and ''C. m. circumcinctus'' of the [[Great Plains]]. On average, ''circumcinctus'' is darker overall with more contrastingly dark cheeks and lores. Breeding male ''circumcinctuses'' show more extensive black on forehead and bill-base and more often shows complete breast-bands. Some overlap exists.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Charadrius melodus -Cape May, New Jersey, USA -adult-8 (6).jpg|upright|left|thumb|On the Atlantic coast, Cape May, New Jersey, USA]]\nThe piping plover is a stout bird with a large rounded head, a short thick neck, and a stubby bill. It is a sand-colored, dull gray/khaki, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]-sized shorebird. The adult has yellow-orange legs, a black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black ring around the neck during the breeding season. During nonbreeding season, the black bands become less pronounced.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> Its bill is orange with a black tip. It ranges from {{convert|15|\u2013|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|35|\u2013|41|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|42|\u2013|64|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name= CRC/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nThe piping plover's light call is a soft, whistled ''peep peep'' given by standing and flying birds. Its frequently heard alarm call is a soft ''pee-werp'', which the second syllable lower pitched.\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\nThe piping plover lives the majority of its life on open sandy beaches or [[rocky shore]]s, often in high, dry sections away from water. They can be found on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] of the U.S. and Canada on the ocean or bay beaches and on the [[Great Lakes]] shores. It builds its nests higher on the shore near beach grass and other objects. It is very rare to see a piping plover anywhere outside of sand or rocky beaches/shores while not migrating. Piping plovers are often found to migrate south to The Bahamas during winter months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/magazine/november-december-2012/solving-piping-plover-puzzle|title=Solving the Piping Plover Puzzle|author=|date=12 October 2012|website=audubon.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPiping plovers [[bird migration|migrate]] from their northern range in the summer to the south in the winter months, migrating to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the southern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the United States and the [[Caribbean]]. They begin migrating north beginning in mid-March. Their breeding grounds extend from southern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] south to the northern parts of [[South Carolina]].<ref name=FWS/> Migration south begins in August for some adults and fledglings, and by mid-September most piping plovers have headed south for winter.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Charadrius melodus -Cape May, New Jersey, USA -parent and chick-8 (1).jpg|right|thumb|Parent and chick on the Atlantic coast, Cape May, New Jersey, USA]]\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Plover Chick.JPG|thumbnail|Piping plover chick at two days old.]]\n[[File:Charadrius-melodus-002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Piping plover chick with [[Bird ringing|band]] at two weeks old.]]\nThe piping plover usually arrives at sandy beaches to breed in mid to late April.<ref name=\"Cairns1982\">{{cite journal|last=Cairns|first=Winifred E.|title=Biology and behavior of breeding piping plovers|year=1982|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=94|issue=4|pages=531\u2013545}}</ref>\n\nMales will begin claiming territories and pairing up in late March. When pairs are formed, the male begins digging out several scrapes ([[bird nest|nests]]) along the high shore near the beach-grass line. The males also perform elaborate courtship ceremonies, including stone tossing and courtship flights featuring repeated dives.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> Scrapes, small depressions in the sand dug by kicking the sand, are often in the same area that [[least tern]]s choose to colonize. Females will sit and evaluate the scrapes, then choose a good scrape and decorate the nest with shells and debris to [[camouflage]] it. Once a scrape is seen as sufficient, the female will allow the male to copulate with her. The male begins a mating ritual of standing upright and \"marching\" towards the female, puffing himself up and quickly stomping his legs. If the female had seen the scrape as adequate, she will allow the male to stand on her back and [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] occurs within a few minutes.\n\nMost first-time nest attempts in each breeding season are four-egg nests which appear as early as mid-to-late April. Females lay one egg every other day. Second, third and sometimes fourth nesting attempts may have only three or two eggs. Incubation of the nest is shared by both the male and the female. Incubation is generally 27 days and eggs usually all hatch on the same day.\n\nAfter chicks hatch, they are able to feed within hours. The adults' role is then to protect them from the elements by [[brooding]] them. They also alert them to any danger. Like many other species of plovers, adult piping plovers will often feign a \"[[Distraction display|broken wing display]]\", drawing attention to themselves and away from the chicks when a predator may be threatening the chicks' safety. The broken wing display is also used during the nesting period to distract predators from the nest.<ref name=LPZPipingPlover/> A major defense mechanism of the chicks is their ability to blend in with the sand. It takes about 30 days before chicks achieve flight capability. They must be able to fly at least {{convert|50|yards|m|abbr=on}} before they can be considered fledglings.\n\nTo protect the nests from predators during incubation, many conservationists use [[exclosure]]s, such as round turkey-wire cages with screened tops. These allow the adults to move in and out but stop predators from getting to the eggs. After the chicks hatch, many areas will put up snow fencing to restrict driving and pets for the safety of the chicks. Threats to nests include [[crow]]s, [[cat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[fox]]es, among others. Exclosures are not always used, as they occasionally draw more attention to the nest than would occur without the exclosure. Natural hazards to eggs or chicks include storms, high winds, and abnormal high tides; human disturbances can cause the abandonment of nests and chicks as well. It is best to stay away from any bird that appears distressed to prevent any [[unintended consequences]].\n\n==Status and conservation==\nThe piping plover is globally threatened and endangered; it is uncommon and local within its range, and has been listed by the United States as \"[[endangered]]\" in the [[Great Lakes]] region and \"[[threatened]]\" in the remainder of its breeding range.<ref name=FWS2/> While it is federally threatened, the piping plover has been listed as state endangered in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  The Parker River Refuge on Plum Island, Massachusetts is a national network of lands and rivers dedicated to the safety of its native wildlife and specifically the Piping Plover.  Protecting the Piper with full beach closures, the Refuge now \"has the second largest plover population on the North Shore\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/pipingploverFAQs2014.pdf#beach|format=PDF|title=The Piping Plover and Beach Closures at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge|website=Fws.gov|accessdate=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Canada, the piping plover is found only on coastal beaches. In 1985, it was declared an endangered species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.<ref name=EnvCan/> A large population in [[Ontario]] has disappeared entirely.<ref name=BIJ1/> In 2008, however, piping plover nests were found at [[Wasaga Beach]] and near [[Sauble Beach, Ontario]], along the Ontario Great Lakes shores.<ref name=ROM/> There is also some evidence of nesting at other sites in Ontario, including [[Port Elgin, Ontario]] in 2014.<ref name=AtlasON/><ref name=MNR/>\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, the piping plover was utilized for its feathers, as were many other birds at the time, as decorations for women's hats. These decorations, called plumes, became a symbol of high society, especially those from larger rare birds. This practice led to its initial population decline. The [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] helped the population recover through the 1930s.<ref name=\"state.nj.us\"/> The second decline in the piping plover's population and range has been attributed to increased development, shoreline stabilization efforts,<ref name=FWS3/> habitat loss and human activity near nesting sites in the decades following [[World War II]].<ref name=\"state.nj.us\"/> The Great Lakes populations eventually shrank to only around two dozen.<ref name=BIJ1/> On the Missouri River sandbars, the number of breeding individuals varied, with the population increasing from 2012 to 2017 following a major habitat creation event.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kelsi L.|last2=Gibson|first2=Daniel|last3=Friedrich|first3=Meryl J.|last4=Huber|first4=Coral J.|last5=Fraser|first5=James D.|last6=Karpanty|first6=Sarah M.|last7=Catlin|first7=Daniel H.|date=2020|title=Using nest captures and video cameras to estimate survival and abundance of breeding Piping Plovers Charadrius melodus|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12726|journal=Ibis|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1111/ibi.12726|issn=1474-919X}}</ref>\n\nCritical nesting habitats are now being protected to help the population during its breeding season. Populations have seen significant increases since the protection programs began, but the species remains in serious danger. Current conservation strategies include identification and preservation of known nesting sites; public education; limiting or preventing pedestrian and/or [[off-road vehicle]] (ORV) traffic near nests and hatched chicks; limiting predation of free-ranging cats, dogs and other pets on breeding pairs, eggs and chicks;<ref name=NatCons/> and removal of foxes, raccoons, skunks, and other predators.<ref name=FWS4/>\n\nIn coastal areas such as [[Plymouth Beach, Massachusetts|Plymouth]],<ref name=Plymouth/> [[Cape Cod]], [[Long Island]], [[Sandy Hook]],<ref name=gateway/> [[Cape Henlopen State Park]] in [[Delaware]], [[North Manitou Island]] in Lake Michigan, and most recently, [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], beach access to pedestrians and ORVs has been limited to protect piping plovers and their chicks at critical times of the breeding season.\n\nVarious environmental organizations are involved in aiding restoration efforts. The Goldenrod Foundation [http://www.goldenrod.org/] unsuccessfully filed suit against the Town of Plymouth in 2010 and 2015 to restrict offroad vehicle access to breeding habitat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/article/20101221/NEWS/312219852|title=Magistrate rules against Goldenrod Foundation on ORV ban|newspaper=Wicked Local Plymouth|date=21 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/article/20150321/NEWS/150329407|title=Court says cars and birds can coexist on Plymouth Long Beach|date=21 March 2015|newspaper=Wicked Local Plymouth}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the first documented pair of piping plovers in [[Chicago]] nested at Montrose Beach.

Before the unification of Italy in 1860, capital punishment was performed in almost all pre-unitarian states, except for [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], where it was historically abolished in 1786.

So Tuscany was the first modern European state in the world to do away with torture and capital punishment.\n\n[[File:Esecuzione monti tognetti roma 1868.jpg|thumb|Execution of capital punishment by [[guillotine]] in 1868, shortly after the birth of modern Italy. The death penalty was subsequently abolished in 1889 and only revived under [[Italian Fascism]].]]\nHowever, the death penalty was sanctioned in the codes of law of all the other pre-unitarian states, therefore when the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed in 1860, legislation was divided, since the death penalty was legal in all of Italy except for [[Tuscany]].\n\nAfterwards, the death penalty was definitively abolished in the Penal Code in 1889 with the almost unanimous approval of both Houses of Parliament under suggestion of Minister Zanardelli.<ref>Indro Montanelli; ''Storia d'italia'', vol 6, pag 215</ref> However executions in Italy had not been carried out since 1877, when King [[Umberto I]] granted a general [[pardon]] (royal decree of pardon of January 18, 1878). Ironically, as a result of this pardon, [[Gaetano Bresci]] could not be sentenced to death after he assassinated Umberto I in 1900. The death penalty was still present in military and colonial penal codes.\n\nIn 1926, it was reintroduced by [[dictator]] [[Benito Mussolini]] to punish those who made an attempt on the king, the queen, the [[heir apparent]] or the Prime Minister as well as for [[espionage]] and armed rebellion. The [[Rocco Code]] (1930, in force from July 1, 1931) added more crimes to the list of those punishable with the death penalty, and reintroduced capital punishment for some common crimes. It was used sparsely, however; until the outbreak of war in 1940, a total of nine executions were carried out, allegedly not for political offenses, followed by another 17 until Italy's surrender in July 1943 (compared to almost 80,000 legal executions in [[Nazi Germany]], including courts martial).<ref>''A History of Fascism'', Stanley G.

The [[President of the Italian Republic|president]], [[Enrico de Nicola]], declined to pardon them, and they were executed by a [[firing squad]] on March 4, 1947 at [[Basse di Stura]] riverside, in the suburbs of [[Turin]]. This was the last execution in Italy.\n\nThe [[Italian Constitution]], approved on December 27, 1947 and in force since January 1, 1948, completely abolished the death penalty for all common military and civil crimes during peacetime. This measure was implemented by the legislative decree 22/48 of January 22, 1948 (provision of coordination as a consequence of the abolishment of capital punishment). The death penalty was still in force in Italy in the military penal code, only for high treason against the Republic or for crimes perpetrated in war theatres (though no execution ever took place) until law 589/94 of October 13, 1994 abolished it completely from there as well, and substituted it with the maximum penalty of the civil penal code (imprisonment for life). In 2007 a constitutional amendment was adopted. Article 27 of Italian Constitution was changed to fully ban the death penalty.\n\nPrior to abolition, the death penalty was sanctioned in article 21 of the Italian penal code. It stated that ''Death penalty is to be carried out by shooting inside a penitentiary or in any other place suggested by the Ministry of Justice. The execution is not public, unless the Ministry of Justice determines otherwise.''\n\nA draft law to ratify the 13th Protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] had been approved by the Senate on October 9, 2008 (it was approved earlier by the Chamber of Deputies on September 24).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=10318705|title=Draft law|website=handsoffcain.info|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164411/http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=10318705|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was ratified on March 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=328|title=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty : uniting all those committed to the universal abolition of capital punishment|author=|date=|website=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Public opinion==\n\nFewer than half of Italians approved of the 2006 [[execution of Saddam Hussein]].

The death penalty was subsequently abolished in 1889 and only revived under [[Italian Fascism]].]]\nHowever, the death penalty was sanctioned in the codes of law of all the other pre-unitarian states, therefore when the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed in 1860, legislation was divided, since the death penalty was legal in all of Italy except for [[Tuscany]].\n\nAfterwards, the death penalty was definitively abolished in the Penal Code in 1889 with the almost unanimous approval of both Houses of Parliament under suggestion of Minister Zanardelli.<ref>Indro Montanelli; ''Storia d'italia'', vol 6, pag 215</ref> However executions in Italy had not been carried out since 1877, when King [[Umberto I]] granted a general [[pardon]] (royal decree of pardon of January 18, 1878). Ironically, as a result of this pardon, [[Gaetano Bresci]] could not be sentenced to death after he assassinated Umberto I in 1900. The death penalty was still present in military and colonial penal codes.\n\nIn 1926, it was reintroduced by [[dictator]] [[Benito Mussolini]] to punish those who made an attempt on the king, the queen, the [[heir apparent]] or the Prime Minister as well as for [[espionage]] and armed rebellion. The [[Rocco Code]] (1930, in force from July 1, 1931) added more crimes to the list of those punishable with the death penalty, and reintroduced capital punishment for some common crimes. It was used sparsely, however; until the outbreak of war in 1940, a total of nine executions were carried out, allegedly not for political offenses, followed by another 17 until Italy's surrender in July 1943 (compared to almost 80,000 legal executions in [[Nazi Germany]], including courts martial).<ref>''A History of Fascism'', Stanley G. Payne, ''Italian Fascism''</ref><ref>Hoffmann, Peter (1977, 1996).

The [[President of the Italian Republic|president]], [[Enrico de Nicola]], declined to pardon them, and they were executed by a [[firing squad]] on March 4, 1947 at [[Basse di Stura]] riverside, in the suburbs of [[Turin]]. This was the last execution in Italy.\n\nThe [[Italian Constitution]], approved on December 27, 1947 and in force since January 1, 1948, completely abolished the death penalty for all common military and civil crimes during peacetime. This measure was implemented by the legislative decree 22/48 of January 22, 1948 (provision of coordination as a consequence of the abolishment of capital punishment). The death penalty was still in force in Italy in the military penal code, only for high treason against the Republic or for crimes perpetrated in war theatres (though no execution ever took place) until law 589/94 of October 13, 1994 abolished it completely from there as well, and substituted it with the maximum penalty of the civil penal code (imprisonment for life). In 2007 a constitutional amendment was adopted. Article 27 of Italian Constitution was changed to fully ban the death penalty.\n\nPrior to abolition, the death penalty was sanctioned in article 21 of the Italian penal code. It stated that ''Death penalty is to be carried out by shooting inside a penitentiary or in any other place suggested by the Ministry of Justice. The execution is not public, unless the Ministry of Justice determines otherwise.''\n\nA draft law to ratify the 13th Protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] had been approved by the Senate on October 9, 2008 (it was approved earlier by the Chamber of Deputies on September 24).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=10318705|title=Draft law|website=handsoffcain.info|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164411/http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=10318705|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was ratified on March 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=328|title=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty : uniting all those committed to the universal abolition of capital punishment|author=|date=|website=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Public opinion==\n\nFewer than half of Italians approved of the 2006 [[execution of Saddam Hussein]]. Italy proposed the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]], which urges states to establish a moratorium on executions with a view toward abolition and urged states around the world to approve it. The former Italian Foreign Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]] also stated that the next step was to work on abolishing the death penalty.\n\nThe 2008 European Values Study (EVS) found that 42% of respondents in Italy said that the death penalty can never be justified, while only 58% said it can always be justified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http://193.175.238.79:80/obj/fStudy/ZA4783&variable=http://193.175.238.79:80/obj/fVariable/ZA4783_V252&mode=documentation&submode=variable&top=yes&language=en|title=GESIS: ZACAT|author=|date=|website=zacat.gesis.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cesare Beccaria]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Italy topics}}\n{{capital punishment}}\n{{Capital punishment in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Capital punishment by country|Italy]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Italy]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Italy]]\n[[Category:Death in Italy]]\n[[Category:Human rights in Italy]]\n[[Category:1948 disestablishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:1889 disestablishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Italy]]\n", "name_user": "24.51.75.9", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Italy"}

Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the temperate [[northern hemisphere]], though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have \"lily\" in their common name but are not related to true lilies.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lillium Stamens.jpg|250px|thumb|''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'' flower \u2013 1. [[Stigma (botany)|Stigma]], 2. [[Gynoecium|Style]], 3. [[Stamen]]s, 4. Filament, 5. [[Tepal]]]]\nLilies are tall [[perennial plant|perennials]] ranging in height from {{convert|2|-|6|ft|cm|abbr=on|-1}}. They form naked or tunicless scaly underground [[bulb]]s which are their organs of [[perennation]]. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into [[rhizome]]s, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop [[stolon]]s. Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out [[adventitious]] roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb.\n[[File:Lily, petal.jpg|150px|thumb|Lily, petal]]\nThe flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in [[raceme]]s or [[umbel]]s at the tip of the stem, with six [[tepals]] spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a \"Turk's cap\". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a [[nectary]] at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the [[anthers]]. The [[fruit]] is a three-celled capsule.<ref name='European Garden Flora'>European Garden Flora; Volume 1</ref>\n[[File:2012-01-04 17-57-36-lys.jpg|150px|thumb|stamen of lilium]]\n[[Seed]]s ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex [[germination]] patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.\n\nNaturally most cool temperate species are [[deciduous]] and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species which distribute in hot summer and mild winter area (''[[Lilium candidum]]'', ''[[Lilium catesbaei]]'', ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'') lose leaves and remain relatively short dormant in Summer or Autumn, sprout from Autumn to winter, forming dwarf stem bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.\n[[File:Lilium candidum MHNT.BOT.2011.18.27.jpg|150px|thumb|''Lilium candidum'' seeds]]\nThe basic [[chromosome number]] is twelve (n=12).<ref>{{cite journal|first1= Veli-Pekka|last1= Pelkonen|first2= Anna-Maria|last2= Pirttil\u00e4|year= 2012|title= Taxonomy and Phylogeny of the Genus Lilium|journal= Floriculture and Ornamental Biotechnology|volume= 6 (Special Issue 2)|pages= 1\u20138|url= http://www.globalsciencebooks.info/Online/GSBOnline/images/2012/FOB_6(SI2)/FOB_6(SI2)1-8o.pdf|accessdate= 2016-07-29}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nTaxonomical division in [[Section (botany)|sections]] follows the classical division of Comber,<ref>Harold Comber, 1949. \"A new classification of the genus ''Lilium''\".

These genera include ''[[Cardiocrinum]]'', ''[[Notholirion]]'', ''[[Nomocharis]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]''.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe botanic name ''Lilium'' is the [[Latin]] form and is a [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] name. The Latin name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''le\u00edrion'', generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the [[Madonna lily]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes |page=186 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://members.shaw.ca/lilynet/netlil/id35.htm |title = Classification |accessdate = 2008-06-22| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080415193108/http://members.shaw.ca/lilynet/netlil/id35.htm| archivedate = April 15, 2008}}</ref> The word was borrowed from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] (dial.

All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew ''sh\u016bshan'', ''sh\u014dshan'', ''sh\u014dshann\u0101'' as \"lily\", but the \"lily among the thorns\" of ''[[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]'', for instance, may be the honeysuckle.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary, 6th ed.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-920687-2|page=3804}}</ref>\n\nFor a list of other species described as lilies, see [[Lily (disambiguation)]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe range of lilies in the Old World extends across much of Europe,  across most of Asia to Japan, south to India, and east to Indochina and the Philippines. In the New World they extend from southern Canada through much of the United States. They are commonly adapted to either woodland habitats, often [[mountain|montane]], or sometimes to grassland habitats. A few can survive in marshland and [[epiphyte]]s are known in tropical southeast Asia. In general they prefer moderately acidic or lime-free soils.\n\n==Ecology==\nLilies are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including the [[Dun-bar]].\n\nThe proliferation of deer (e.g. ''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]'') in many places, mainly due to factors such as the elimination of large predators for human safety, is responsible for a downturn in lily populations in the wild and is a threat to garden lilies as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.esa.org/tiee/vol/v2/issues/figure_sets/deer/overview.html |title=Ecological Impacts of High Deer Densities |website=Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology |date=2004 |publisher=Ecological Society of America |access-date= 2019-11-27}}</ref> Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://homeguides.sfgate.com/deer-eat-hostas-lilies-104420.html |title=Will Deer Eat Hostas & Lilies? |website=SFGate |publisher=Hearst |access-date= 2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nMany species are widely grown in the garden in [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[sub-tropical]] regions. They may also be grown as potted plants. Numerous ornamental [[Hybrid plant|hybrids]] have been developed. They can be used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as patio plants. Some lilies, especially ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'', form important [[cut flower]] crops. These may be forced for particular markets; for instance, ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'' for the Easter trade, when it may be called the [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lily]].\n\nLilies are usually planted as bulbs in the dormant season. They are best planted in a south-facing (northern hemisphere), slightly sloping aspect, in sun or part shade, at a depth 2\u00bd times the height of the bulb (except ''[[Lilium candidum]]'' which should be planted at the surface). Most prefer a porous, loamy soil, and good drainage is essential. Most species bloom in July or August (northern hemisphere). The flowering periods of certain lily species begin in late spring, while others bloom in late summer or early autumn.<ref>{{cite web|authors=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Lily|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/341076/lily|accessdate=2014-02-19|year=2016}}</ref> They have contractile roots which pull the plant down to the correct depth, therefore it is better to plant them too shallowly than too deep. A [[soil pH]] of around 6.5 is generally safe. The soil should be well-drained, and plants must be kept watered during the growing season. Some plants have strong wiry stems, but those with heavy flower heads may need staking.<ref>{{cite book|title=RHS encyclopedia of plants & flowers|year=2010|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-4053-5423-3|page=744}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferson-Brown|first=Michael|title=Lilies (Wisley handbooks)|year=2008|publisher=Mitchell Beazley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84533-384-3|page=96}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe following lily species and [[cultivars]] currently hold the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017):<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants \u2013 Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 60 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 2 March 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Lilium Golden Splendour3.jpg|thumb|'Golden Splendor\u2019]]\n*African Queen Group (VI-/a) 2002 H6\n*'Casa Blanca' (VIIb/b-c) 1993 H6\n*'Fata Morgana' (Ia/b) 2002 H6 \n*'Garden Party' (VIIb/b) 2002 H6\n*Golden Splendor Group (VIb-c/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/42234/i-Lilium-i-Golden-Splendor-Group-(Vib-c-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium'' Golden Splendor Group | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n*''[[Lilium henryi]]'' (IXc/d) 1993 H6 \n* ''[[Lilium mackliniae]]'' (IXc/a) 2012 H5\n* ''[[Lilium martagon]]'' \u2013 Turk's cap lily (IXc/d)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10205/i-Lilium-martagon-i-(Ixc-d)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium martagon'' | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n* ''[[Lilium pardalinum]]'' \u2013 leopard lily (IXc/d)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10221/i-Lilium-pardalinum-i-(Ixc-d)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium pardalinum'' | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n*Pink Perfection Group (VIb/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/61747/i-Lilium-i-Pink-Perfection-Group-(Vib-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium'' Pink Perfection Group | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n* ''[[Lilium regale]]'' \u2013 regal lily, king's lily (IXb/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10248/i-Lilium-regale-i-(Ixb-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium regale'' | accessdate = 2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Classification of garden forms===\nNumerous forms, mostly hybrids, are grown for the garden.

Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the temperate [[northern hemisphere]], though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have \"lily\" in their common name but are not related to true lilies.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lillium Stamens.jpg|250px|thumb|''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'' flower \u2013 1. [[Stigma (botany)|Stigma]], 2. [[Gynoecium|Style]], 3. [[Stamen]]s, 4. Filament, 5. [[Tepal]]]]\nLilies are tall [[perennial plant|perennials]] ranging in height from {{convert|2|-|6|ft|cm|abbr=on|-1}}. They form naked or tunicless scaly underground [[bulb]]s which are their organs of [[perennation]]. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into [[rhizome]]s, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop [[stolon]]s. Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out [[adventitious]] roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb.\n[[File:Lily, petal.jpg|150px|thumb|Lily, petal]]\nThe flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in [[raceme]]s or [[umbel]]s at the tip of the stem, with six [[tepals]] spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a \"Turk's cap\". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a [[nectary]] at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the [[anthers]]. The [[fruit]] is a three-celled capsule.<ref name='European Garden Flora'>European Garden Flora; Volume 1</ref>\n[[File:2012-01-04 17-57-36-lys.jpg|150px|thumb|stamen of lilium]]\n[[Seed]]s ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex [[germination]] patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.\n\nNaturally most cool temperate species are [[deciduous]] and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species which distribute in hot summer and mild winter area (''[[Lilium candidum]]'', ''[[Lilium catesbaei]]'', ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'') lose leaves and remain relatively short dormant in Summer or Autumn, sprout from Autumn to winter, forming dwarf stem bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.\n[[File:Lilium candidum MHNT.BOT.2011.18.27.jpg|150px|thumb|''Lilium candidum'' seeds]]\nThe basic [[chromosome number]] is twelve (n=12).<ref>{{cite journal|first1= Veli-Pekka|last1= Pelkonen|first2= Anna-Maria|last2= Pirttil\u00e4|year= 2012|title= Taxonomy and Phylogeny of the Genus Lilium|journal= Floriculture and Ornamental Biotechnology|volume= 6 (Special Issue 2)|pages= 1\u20138|url= http://www.globalsciencebooks.info/Online/GSBOnline/images/2012/FOB_6(SI2)/FOB_6(SI2)1-8o.pdf|accessdate= 2016-07-29}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nTaxonomical division in [[Section (botany)|sections]] follows the classical division of Comber,<ref>Harold Comber, 1949. \"A new classification of the genus ''Lilium''\".

These genera include ''[[Cardiocrinum]]'', ''[[Notholirion]]'', ''[[Nomocharis]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]''.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe botanic name ''Lilium'' is the [[Latin]] form and is a [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] name. The Latin name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''le\u00edrion'', generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the [[Madonna lily]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes |page=186 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://members.shaw.ca/lilynet/netlil/id35.htm |title = Classification |accessdate = 2008-06-22| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080415193108/http://members.shaw.ca/lilynet/netlil/id35.htm| archivedate = April 15, 2008}}</ref> The word was borrowed from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] (dial.

All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew ''sh\u016bshan'', ''sh\u014dshan'', ''sh\u014dshann\u0101'' as \"lily\", but the \"lily among the thorns\" of ''[[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]'', for instance, may be the honeysuckle.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary, 6th ed.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-920687-2|page=3804}}</ref>\n\nFor a list of other species described as lilies, see [[Lily (disambiguation)]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe range of lilies in the Old World extends across much of Europe,  across most of Asia to Japan, south to India, and east to Indochina and the Philippines. In the New World they extend from southern Canada through much of the United States. They are commonly adapted to either woodland habitats, often [[mountain|montane]], or sometimes to grassland habitats. A few can survive in marshland and [[epiphyte]]s are known in tropical southeast Asia. In general they prefer moderately acidic or lime-free soils.\n\n==Ecology==\nLilies are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including the [[Dun-bar]].\n\nThe proliferation of deer (e.g. ''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]'') in many places, mainly due to factors such as the elimination of large predators for human safety, is responsible for a downturn in lily populations in the wild and is a threat to garden lilies as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.esa.org/tiee/vol/v2/issues/figure_sets/deer/overview.html |title=Ecological Impacts of High Deer Densities |website=Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology |date=2004 |publisher=Ecological Society of America |access-date= 2019-11-27}}</ref> Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://homeguides.sfgate.com/deer-eat-hostas-lilies-104420.html |title=Will Deer Eat Hostas & Lilies? |website=SFGate |publisher=Hearst |access-date= 2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nMany species are widely grown in the garden in [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[sub-tropical]] regions. They may also be grown as potted plants. Numerous ornamental [[Hybrid plant|hybrids]] have been developed. They can be used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as patio plants. Some lilies, especially ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'', form important [[cut flower]] crops. These may be forced for particular markets; for instance, ''[[Lilium longiflorum]]'' for the Easter trade, when it may be called the [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lily]].\n\nLilies are usually planted as bulbs in the dormant season. They are best planted in a south-facing (northern hemisphere), slightly sloping aspect, in sun or part shade, at a depth 2\u00bd times the height of the bulb (except ''[[Lilium candidum]]'' which should be planted at the surface). Most prefer a porous, loamy soil, and good drainage is essential. Most species bloom in July or August (northern hemisphere). The flowering periods of certain lily species begin in late spring, while others bloom in late summer or early autumn.<ref>{{cite web|authors=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Lily|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/341076/lily|accessdate=2014-02-19|year=2016}}</ref> They have contractile roots which pull the plant down to the correct depth, therefore it is better to plant them too shallowly than too deep. A [[soil pH]] of around 6.5 is generally safe. The soil should be well-drained, and plants must be kept watered during the growing season. Some plants have strong wiry stems, but those with heavy flower heads may need staking.<ref>{{cite book|title=RHS encyclopedia of plants & flowers|year=2010|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-4053-5423-3|page=744}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferson-Brown|first=Michael|title=Lilies (Wisley handbooks)|year=2008|publisher=Mitchell Beazley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84533-384-3|page=96}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe following lily species and [[cultivars]] currently hold the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017):<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants \u2013 Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 60 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 2 March 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Lilium Golden Splendour3.jpg|thumb|'Golden Splendor\u2019]]\n*African Queen Group (VI-/a) 2002 H6\n*'Casa Blanca' (VIIb/b-c) 1993 H6\n*'Fata Morgana' (Ia/b) 2002 H6 \n*'Garden Party' (VIIb/b) 2002 H6\n*Golden Splendor Group (VIb-c/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/42234/i-Lilium-i-Golden-Splendor-Group-(Vib-c-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium'' Golden Splendor Group | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n*''[[Lilium henryi]]'' (IXc/d) 1993 H6 \n* ''[[Lilium mackliniae]]'' (IXc/a) 2012 H5\n* ''[[Lilium martagon]]'' \u2013 Turk's cap lily (IXc/d)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10205/i-Lilium-martagon-i-(Ixc-d)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium martagon'' | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n* ''[[Lilium pardalinum]]'' \u2013 leopard lily (IXc/d)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10221/i-Lilium-pardalinum-i-(Ixc-d)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium pardalinum'' | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n*Pink Perfection Group (VIb/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/61747/i-Lilium-i-Pink-Perfection-Group-(Vib-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium'' Pink Perfection Group | accessdate = 22 March 2018}}</ref> \n* ''[[Lilium regale]]'' \u2013 regal lily, king's lily (IXb/a)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/10248/i-Lilium-regale-i-(Ixb-a)/Details | title = RHS Plantfinder \u2013 ''Lilium regale'' | accessdate = 2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Classification of garden forms===\nNumerous forms, mostly hybrids, are grown for the garden.
