In these exhibitions, Falcone manifests another phase of her personality with her most well-known work, \"Windows of the Soul\", revealing elements that reflect her life experience. Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

She wrote two novels and thirty-two short stories, as well as a number of reviews and commentaries.\n\nShe was a [[Southern literature|Southern writer]] who often wrote in a sardonic [[Southern Gothic]] style and relied heavily on regional settings and [[grotesque]] characters, often in violent situations. The unsentimental acceptance or rejection of the limitations or imperfection or difference of these characters (whether attributed to disability, race, crime, religion or sanity) typically underpins the drama.<ref>{{cite book|author=Basselin, Timothy J. |date=2013 |title=Flannery O'Connor: Writing a Theology of Disabled Humanity|publisher=baylorpress.com }}</ref>\n\nHer writing reflected her [[Roman Catholic]] faith and frequently examined questions of [[morality]] and ethics. Her posthumously compiled ''Complete Stories'' won the 1972 U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]] and has been the subject of enduring praise.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Flannery oconnor home.jpg|thumb|[[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home|O'Connor's childhood home]] in Savannah, Georgia]]\n\nO'Connor was born on March 25, 1925, in [[Savannah, Georgia]], the only child of Edward Francis O'Connor, a real estate agent, and Regina Cline, who were both of Irish descent.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Connor |1y=1979 |1p=3 |2a1=O'Connor |2y=1979 |2p=233 |2ps=: \"My papa was a real-estate man\" (letter to [[Elizabeth Fenwick Way]], August 4, 1957) |3a1=Gooch |3y=2009 |3p=29}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/goreyguardian/out-about/focus-on-flannery-oconnor-at-write-by-the-sea-38201264.html|title=Focus on Flannery O'Connor at Write by the Sea|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref> As an adult, she remembered herself as a \"pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I'll-bite-you complex.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gooch|2009|p=30}}; {{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Blake |title=Between the House and the Chicken Yard |journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]] |issue=Spring 2009 |pages=202\u2013205 |url=http://www.vqronline.org/between-house-and-chicken-yard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602052313/http://www.vqronline.org/between-house-and-chicken-yard |archive-date=June 2, 2016 |url-status=live |mode=cs2}}.</ref> The [[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home]] museum is located at 207 E.

While there, she got to know several important writers and critics who lectured or taught in the program, among them [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Robie Macauley]], [[Austin Warren]] and [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]].{{r|Gordon}} Lytle, for many years editor of the ''[[Sewanee Review]]'', was one of the earliest admirers of her fiction. He later published several of her stories in the ''Sewanee Review'', as well as critical essays on her work. Workshop director [[Paul Engle]] was the first to read and comment on the initial drafts of what would become ''[[Wise Blood]]''. She received an M.A. from the University of Iowa in 1947.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1965|p=xii}} During the summer of 1948, O'Connor continued to work on ''Wise Blood'' at [[Yaddo]], an artists' community in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], where she also completed several short stories.{{sfn|Gooch|2009|pp=146\u201352}}\n\nIn 1949, O'Connor met and eventually accepted an invitation to stay with [[Robert Fitzgerald]] (a well-known translator of the classics) and his wife, Sally, in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=4}}\n\n==Career==\nO'Connor is primarily known for her short stories. She published two books of short stories: ''[[A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]'' (1955) and ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]'' (published posthumously in 1965).  Many of O'Connor's short stories have been re-published in major anthologies, including ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' and ''[[Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards.|Prize Stories]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=David |title=Flannery O'Connor: A Descriptive Bibliography |publisher=Garland Publishing |date=1981 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nO'Connor's two novels are ''[[Wise Blood]]'' (1952) (made into a [[Wise Blood (film)|film]] by John Huston) and ''[[The Violent Bear It Away]]'' (1960). She also has had several books of her other writings published, and her enduring influence is attested by a growing body of scholarly studies of her work.\n\nFragments exist of an unfinished novel tentatively titled ''Why Do the Heathen Rage?'' that draws from several of her short stories, including \"Why Do the Heathen Rage?,\" \"The Enduring Chill,\" and \"[[The Partridge Festival]].\"\n\nHer writing career can be divided into four five-year periods of increasing skill and ambition, 1945 to 1964:\n* Postgrad Student: Iowa Writers' Workshop, first published stories, drafts of Wise Blood. Literary influences include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Henry James]] \n* Early: ''[[Wise Blood]]'' completed and published. In this period, satirical elements dominate. Influences include [[Jacques Maritain]]\n* Mid: ''[[A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]'' published, ''[[The Violent Bear It Away]]'' written and published. Influences include [[Friedrich von H\u00fcgel]]. In this period, the mystical undercurrents begin to have primacy.\n* Mature: ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]'' written. Influences include [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and Mary Anne Long. In this period, the notion of grotesque is expanded to include the good as grotesque, and the grotesque as good.\n\n==Characteristics==\nRegarding her emphasis of the [[grotesque]], O'Connor said: \"anything that comes out of the South is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case it is going to be called realistic.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1969|p=40}} Her texts usually take place in the South{{r|Enniss (2007)}} and revolve around morally flawed characters, frequently interacting with people with disabilities or disabled themselves (as O'Connor was), while the issue of race often appears in the background. Most of her works feature disturbing elements, though she did not like to be characterized as cynical. \"I am mighty tired of reading reviews that call ''A Good Man'' brutal and sarcastic,\" she wrote.{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}} \"The stories are hard but they are hard because there is nothing harder or less sentimental than Christian realism. ...When I see these stories described as horror stories I am always amused because the reviewer always has hold of the wrong horror.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}}\n\nShe felt deeply informed by the sacramental and by the [[Thomist]] notion that the created world is charged with God. Yet she would not write [[apologetic]] fiction of the kind prevalent in the Catholic literature of the time, explaining that a writer's meaning must be evident in his or her fiction without [[didacticism]]. She wrote ironic, subtly allegorical fiction about deceptively backward Southern characters, usually fundamentalist Protestants, who undergo transformations of character that, to her thinking, brought them closer to the Catholic mind. The transformation is often accomplished through pain, violence, and ludicrous behavior in the pursuit of the holy. However grotesque the setting, she tried to portray her characters as open to the touch of [[divine grace]]. This ruled out a sentimental understanding of the stories' violence, as of her own illness. She wrote: \"Grace changes us and the change is painful.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=307}}\n\nShe also had a deeply [[sardonic]] sense of humor, often based in the disparity between her characters' limited perceptions and the awesome fate awaiting them. Another source of humor is frequently found in the attempt of well-meaning liberals to cope with the rural South on their own terms. O'Connor used such characters' inability to come to terms with disability, race, poverty, and fundamentalism, other than in sentimental illusions, as an example of the failure of the secular world in the twentieth century.\n\nHowever, in several stories O'Connor explored some of the most sensitive contemporary issues that her liberal and fundamentalist characters might encounter. She addressed the [[Holocaust]] in her story \"[[The Displaced Person]]\", [[racial integration]] in \"[[Everything That Rises Must Converge (short story)|Everything That Rises Must Converge]]\" and [[intersex]]uality in \"[[A Temple of the Holy Ghost]].\" Her fiction often included references to the problem of race in the South; occasionally, racial issues come to the forefront, as in \"[[The Artificial Nigger]],\" \"Everything that Rises Must Converge,\" and \"[[Judgement Day (short story)|Judgement Day]],\" her last short story and a drastically rewritten version of her first published story, \"[[The Geranium]].\"\n\nDespite her secluded life, her writing reveals an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behavior. O'Connor gave many lectures on faith and literature, traveling quite far despite her frail health. Politically, she maintained a broadly progressive outlook in connection with her faith, voting for [[John F.

Despite the debilitating effects of the steroid drugs used to treat O'Connor's lupus, she nonetheless made over sixty appearances at lectures to read her works.{{r|Gordon}}\n\nO'Connor completed more than two dozen short stories and two novels while suffering from lupus. She died on August 3, 1964, at the age of 39 in Baldwin County Hospital.{{r|Gordon}} Her death was caused by complications from a new attack of lupus following surgery for a [[fibroma]].{{r|Gordon}} She was buried in Milledgeville, Georgia,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1965|p=viii}} at [[Memory Hill Cemetery]].{{r|Gordon|Find a Grave}}\n\n==Letters==\nThroughout her life, O'Connor maintained a wide correspondence,{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|pp=''xii''\u2013''xiv'', ''xvi'', ''xvii''}} including with writers [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} English professor [[Samuel Ashley Brown]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} and playwright [[Maryat Lee]].<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|1979|p=193}}: \"There are no other letters among Flannery's like those to Maryat Lee, none so playful and so often slambang.\"</ref> After her death, a selection of her letters, edited by her friend Sally Fitzgerald, was published as ''The Habit of Being''.{{r|Young (2007)}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} Much of O'Connor's best-known writing on religion, writing, and the South is contained in these and other letters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1955, [[Betty Hester]], an Atlanta file clerk, wrote O'Connor a letter expressing admiration for her work.{{r|Young (2007)}} Hester's letter drew O'Connor's attention,<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|1979|p=90}}: \"You were very kind to write me and the measure of my appreciation must be to ask you to write me again. I would like to know who this is who understands my stories.\"</ref> and they corresponded frequently.{{r|Young (2007)}} For ''The Habit of Being'', Hester provided Fitzgerald with all the letters she received from O'Connor but requested that her identity be kept private; she was identified only as \"A.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}} The complete collection of the unedited letters between O'Connor and Hester was unveiled by [[Emory University]] in May 2007; the letters had been given to the university in 1987 with the stipulation that they not be released to the public for 20 years.{{r|Young (2007)|Enniss (2007)}}\n\nEmory University also contains the more than 600 letters O'Connor wrote to her mother, Regina, nearly every day while she was pursuing her literary career in Iowa City, New York, and Massachusetts. Some of these describe \"travel itineraries and plumbing mishaps, ripped stockings and roommates with loud radios,\" as well as her request for the homemade mayonnaise of her childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lithub.com/flannery-oconnors-two-deepest-loves-were-mayonnaise-and-her-mother/|title=Flannery O'Connor's Two Deepest Loves Were Mayonnaise and Her Mother|last=McCoy|first=Caroline|date=May 17, 2019|website=Literary Hub|access-date=}}</ref> O'Connor lived with her mother for 34 of her 39 years of life.\n\n==Catholicism==\nO'Connor was a devout Catholic. From 1956 through 1964, she wrote more than one hundred book reviews for two Catholic diocesan newspapers in Georgia: ''The Bulletin'' and ''The Southern Cross''.{{sfn|O'Connor|2008|p=3}} According to fellow reviewer Joey Zuber, the wide range of books she chose to review demonstrated that she was profoundly intellectual.{{sfn|Martin|1968}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}} Her reviews consistently confronted theological and ethical themes in books written by the most serious and demanding theologians of her time.{{sfn|O'Connor|2008|p=4}} Professor of English Carter Martin, an authority on O'Connor's writings, notes simply that her \"book reviews are at one with her religious life.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|2008|p=4}}\n\nA prayer journal O'Connor had kept during her time at the University of Iowa was published in 2013.{{r|Robinson (2013)}} It included prayers and ruminations on faith, writing, and O'Connor's relationship with God.{{r|Cep (2013)|Robinson (2013)|New Yorker (2013)}}\n\n==Enjoyment of birds==\nO'Connor frequently used bird imagery within her fiction.\n\nWhen she was six, living in a house still standing (now preserved as the [[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home]]), O'Connor experienced her first brush with celebrity status. [[Path\u00e9 News]] filmed \"Little Mary O'Connor\" with her trained chicken<ref>{{cite AV media |people=O'Connor, Flannery |date=1932 |title=Do You Reverse? |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Path\u00e9 |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/do-you-reverse-1/}}</ref> and showed the film around the country. She said: \"When I was six I had a chicken that walked backward and was in the Path\u00e9 News. I was in it too with the chicken. I was just there to assist the chicken but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been an anticlimax.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|Magee|1987|p=38}}\n\nIn high school, when the girls were required to sew Sunday dresses for themselves, O'Connor sewed a full outfit of underwear and clothes to fit her pet duck and brought the duck to school to model it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Basselin, Timothy J. |date=2013 |title=Flannery O'Connor: Writing a Theology of Disabled Humanity|publisher=baylorpress.com |page=9}}</ref>\n\nAs an adult at Andalusia, she raised and nurtured some 100 [[peafowl]]. Fascinated by birds of all kinds, she raised ducks, ostriches, emus, toucans, and any sort of exotic bird she could obtain, while incorporating images of peacocks into her books. She described her peacocks in an essay entitled \"The King of the Birds\".\n\n==Legacy, awards, and tributes==\nO'Connor's ''Complete Stories'' won the 1972 U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]]{{r|National Book Awards 1972}} and, in a 2009 online poll, was named the best book ever to have won the National Book Awards.{{r|Itzkoff (2009)}}\n\nIn June 2015, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored O'Connor with a new postage stamp, the 30th issuance in the Literary Arts series.{{r|USPS (2015)}} Some criticized the stamp as failing to reflect O'Connor's character and legacy.{{r|Downes (2015)|FSG (2015)}}\n\nThe [[Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction]], named in honor of O'Connor by the [[University of Georgia Press]], is a prize given annually since 1983 to an outstanding collection of short stories.{{r|FOA Winners}}\n\nThe Flannery O'Connor Book Trail is a series of [[Little Free Libraries]] stretching between O'Connor's homes in Savannah and Milledgeville.{{r|Lebos (2014)}}\n\nThe [[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home]] is a historic house museum in Savannah, Georgia, where O'Connor lived during her childhood.{{r|Childhood Home}} In addition to serving as a museum, the house hosts regular events and programs.{{r|Childhood Home}}\n\nBono of [[U2]] quotes \"Where you come from is gone, where you thought you were going to never was there,

She wrote two novels and thirty-two short stories, as well as a number of reviews and commentaries.\n\nShe was a [[Southern literature|Southern writer]] who often wrote in a sardonic [[Southern Gothic]] style and relied heavily on regional settings and [[grotesque]] characters, often in violent situations. The unsentimental acceptance or rejection of the limitations or imperfection or difference of these characters (whether attributed to disability, race, crime, religion or sanity) typically underpins the drama.<ref>{{cite book|author=Basselin, Timothy J. |date=2013 |title=Flannery O'Connor: Writing a Theology of Disabled Humanity|publisher=baylorpress.com }}</ref>\n\nHer writing reflected her [[Roman Catholic]] faith and frequently examined questions of [[morality]] and ethics. Her posthumously compiled ''Complete Stories'' won the 1972 U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]] and has been the subject of enduring praise.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Flannery oconnor home.jpg|thumb|[[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home|O'Connor's childhood home]] in Savannah, Georgia]]\n\nO'Connor was born on March 25, 1925, in [[Savannah, Georgia]], the only child of Edward Francis O'Connor, a real estate agent, and Regina Cline, who were both of Irish descent.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Connor |1y=1979 |1p=3 |2a1=O'Connor |2y=1979 |2p=233 |2ps=: \"My papa was a real-estate man\" (letter to [[Elizabeth Fenwick Way]], August 4, 1957) |3a1=Gooch |3y=2009 |3p=29}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/goreyguardian/out-about/focus-on-flannery-oconnor-at-write-by-the-sea-38201264.html|title=Focus on Flannery O'Connor at Write by the Sea|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref> As an adult, she remembered herself as a \"pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I'll-bite-you complex.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gooch|2009|p=30}}; {{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Blake |title=Between the House and the Chicken Yard |journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]] |issue=Spring 2009 |pages=202\u2013205 |url=http://www.vqronline.org/between-house-and-chicken-yard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602052313/http://www.vqronline.org/between-house-and-chicken-yard |archive-date=June 2, 2016 |url-status=live |mode=cs2}}.</ref> The [[Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home]] museum is located at 207 E.

While there, she got to know several important writers and critics who lectured or taught in the program, among them [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Robie Macauley]], [[Austin Warren]] and [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]].{{r|Gordon}} Lytle, for many years editor of the ''[[Sewanee Review]]'', was one of the earliest admirers of her fiction. He later published several of her stories in the ''Sewanee Review'', as well as critical essays on her work. Workshop director [[Paul Engle]] was the first to read and comment on the initial drafts of what would become ''[[Wise Blood]]''. She received an M.A. from the University of Iowa in 1947.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1965|p=xii}} During the summer of 1948, O'Connor continued to work on ''Wise Blood'' at [[Yaddo]], an artists' community in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], where she also completed several short stories.{{sfn|Gooch|2009|pp=146\u201352}}\n\nIn 1949, O'Connor met and eventually accepted an invitation to stay with [[Robert Fitzgerald]] (a well-known translator of the classics) and his wife, Sally, in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=4}}\n\n==Career==\nO'Connor is primarily known for her short stories. She published two books of short stories: ''[[A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]'' (1955) and ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]'' (published posthumously in 1965).  Many of O'Connor's short stories have been re-published in major anthologies, including ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' and ''[[Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards.|Prize Stories]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=David |title=Flannery O'Connor: A Descriptive Bibliography |publisher=Garland Publishing |date=1981 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nO'Connor's two novels are ''[[Wise Blood]]'' (1952) (made into a [[Wise Blood (film)|film]] by John Huston) and ''[[The Violent Bear It Away]]'' (1960). She also has had several books of her other writings published, and her enduring influence is attested by a growing body of scholarly studies of her work.\n\nFragments exist of an unfinished novel tentatively titled ''Why Do the Heathen Rage?'' that draws from several of her short stories, including \"Why Do the Heathen Rage?,\" \"The Enduring Chill,\" and \"[[The Partridge Festival]].\"\n\nHer writing career can be divided into four five-year periods of increasing skill and ambition, 1945 to 1964:\n* Postgrad Student: Iowa Writers' Workshop, first published stories, drafts of Wise Blood. Literary influences include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Henry James]] \n* Early: ''[[Wise Blood]]'' completed and published. In this period, satirical elements dominate. Influences include [[Jacques Maritain]]\n* Mid: ''[[A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]'' published, ''[[The Violent Bear It Away]]'' written and published. Influences include [[Friedrich von H\u00fcgel]]. In this period, the mystical undercurrents begin to have primacy.\n* Mature: ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]'' written. Influences include [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and Mary Anne Long. In this period, the notion of grotesque is expanded to include the good as grotesque, and the grotesque as good.\n\n==Characteristics==\nRegarding her emphasis of the [[grotesque]], O'Connor said: \"anything that comes out of the South is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case it is going to be called realistic.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1969|p=40}} Her texts usually take place in the South{{r|Enniss (2007)}} and revolve around morally flawed characters, frequently interacting with people with disabilities or disabled themselves (as O'Connor was), while the issue of race often appears in the background. Most of her works feature disturbing elements, though she did not like to be characterized as cynical. \"I am mighty tired of reading reviews that call ''A Good Man'' brutal and sarcastic,\" she wrote.{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}} \"The stories are hard but they are hard because there is nothing harder or less sentimental than Christian realism. ...When I see these stories described as horror stories I am always amused because the reviewer always has hold of the wrong horror.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}}\n\nShe felt deeply informed by the sacramental and by the [[Thomist]] notion that the created world is charged with God. Yet she would not write [[apologetic]] fiction of the kind prevalent in the Catholic literature of the time, explaining that a writer's meaning must be evident in his or her fiction without [[didacticism]]. She wrote ironic, subtly allegorical fiction about deceptively backward Southern characters, usually fundamentalist Protestants, who undergo transformations of character that, to her thinking, brought them closer to the Catholic mind. The transformation is often accomplished through pain, violence, and ludicrous behavior in the pursuit of the holy. However grotesque the setting, she tried to portray her characters as open to the touch of [[divine grace]]. This ruled out a sentimental understanding of the stories' violence, as of her own illness. She wrote: \"Grace changes us and the change is painful.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=307}}\n\nShe also had a deeply [[sardonic]] sense of humor, often based in the disparity between her characters' limited perceptions and the awesome fate awaiting them. Another source of humor is frequently found in the attempt of well-meaning liberals to cope with the rural South on their own terms. O'Connor used such characters' inability to come to terms with disability, race, poverty, and fundamentalism, other than in sentimental illusions, as an example of the failure of the secular world in the twentieth century.\n\nHowever, in several stories O'Connor explored some of the most sensitive contemporary issues that her liberal and fundamentalist characters might encounter. She addressed the [[Holocaust]] in her story \"[[The Displaced Person]]\", [[racial integration]] in \"[[Everything That Rises Must Converge (short story)|Everything That Rises Must Converge]]\" and [[intersex]]uality in \"[[A Temple of the Holy Ghost]].\" Her fiction often included references to the problem of race in the South; occasionally, racial issues come to the forefront, as in \"[[The Artificial Nigger]],\" \"Everything that Rises Must Converge,\" and \"[[Judgement Day (short story)|Judgement Day]],\" her last short story and a drastically rewritten version of her first published story, \"[[The Geranium]].\"\n\nDespite her secluded life, her writing reveals an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behavior. O'Connor gave many lectures on faith and literature, traveling quite far despite her frail health. Politically, she maintained a broadly progressive outlook in connection with her faith, voting for [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1960 and supporting the work of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spivey |first1=Ted R. |title=Flannery O'Connor: The Woman, the Thinker, the Visionary |date=1997 |publisher=Mercer University Press |page=60}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\n[[File:Andalusia (farmhouse); Milledgeville, Georgia; January 29, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Andalusia Farm, where O'Connor lived from 1952 to 1964]]\n\nBy the summer of 1952, O'Connor was diagnosed with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (lupus),{{sfn|O'Connor |1979 |p=40 |ps=&nbsp;(letter to Sally Fitzgerald, undated, summer 1952)}} as her father had been before her.{{sfn|Giannone|2012|p=23}} Subsequently, she returned to the family farm, [[Andalusia (Milledgeville, Georgia)|Andalusia]], in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].{{r|Gordon}} O'Connor lived for twelve years after her diagnosis, seven years longer than expected.\n\nHer daily routine was to attend Mass, write in the morning, then spend the rest of the day recuperating and reading. Despite the debilitating effects of the steroid drugs used to treat O'Connor's lupus, she nonetheless made over sixty appearances at lectures to read her works.{{r|Gordon}}\n\nO'Connor completed more than two dozen short stories and two novels while suffering from lupus. She died on August 3, 1964, at the age of 39 in Baldwin County Hospital.{{r|Gordon}} Her death was caused by complications from a new attack of lupus following surgery for a [[fibroma]].{{r|Gordon}} She was buried in Milledgeville, Georgia,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1965|p=viii}} at [[Memory Hill Cemetery]].{{r|Gordon|Find a Grave}}\n\n==Letters==\nThroughout her life, O'Connor maintained a wide correspondence,{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|pp=''xii''\u2013''xiv'', ''xvi'', ''xvii''}} including with writers [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} English professor [[Samuel Ashley Brown]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} and playwright [[Maryat Lee]].<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|1979|p=193}}: \"There are no other letters among Flannery's like those to Maryat Lee, none so playful and so often slambang.\"</ref> After her death, a selection of her letters, edited by her friend Sally Fitzgerald, was published as ''The Habit of Being''.{{r|Young (2007)}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|ps=&nbsp;''passim''.}} Much of O'Connor's best-known writing on religion, writing, and the South is contained in these and other letters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1955, [[Betty Hester]], an Atlanta file clerk, wrote O'Connor a letter expressing admiration for her work.{{r|Young (2007)}} Hester's letter drew O'Connor's attention,<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|1979|p=90}}: \"You were very kind to write me and the measure of my appreciation must be to ask you to write me again. I would like to know who this is who understands my stories.\"</ref> and they corresponded frequently.{{r|Young (2007)}} For ''The Habit of Being'', Hester provided Fitzgerald with all the letters she received from O'Connor but requested that her identity be kept private; she was identified only as \"A.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|1979|p=90}} The complete collection of the unedited letters between O'Connor and Hester was unveiled by [[Emory University]] in May 2007; the letters had been given to the university in 1987 with the stipulation that they not be released to the public for 20 years.{{r|Young (2007)|Enniss (2007)}}\n\nEmory University also contains the more than 600 letters O'Connor wrote to her mother, Regina, nearly every day while she was pursuing her literary career in Iowa City, New York, and Massachusetts.

[[Path\u00e9 News]] filmed \"Little Mary O'Connor\" with her trained chicken<ref>{{cite AV media |people=O'Connor, Flannery |date=1932 |title=Do You Reverse? |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Path\u00e9 |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/do-you-reverse-1/}}</ref> and showed the film around the country. She said: \"When I was six I had a chicken that walked backward and was in the Path\u00e9 News. I was in it too with the chicken. I was just there to assist the chicken but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been an anticlimax.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|Magee|1987|p=38}}\n\nIn high school, when the girls were required to sew Sunday dresses for themselves, O'Connor sewed a full outfit of underwear and clothes to fit her pet duck and brought the duck to school to model it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Basselin, Timothy J. |date=2013 |title=Flannery O'Connor: Writing a Theology of Disabled Humanity|publisher=baylorpress.com |page=9}}</ref>\n\nAs an adult at Andalusia, she raised and nurtured some 100 [[peafowl]]. Fascinated by birds of all kinds, she raised ducks, ostriches, emus, toucans, and any sort of exotic bird she could obtain, while incorporating images of peacocks into her books.

As a Soviet [[double agent]], he passed to the [[Soviet Union]] the raw [[Tunny (cryptography)|Tunny]] decryptions that influenced the [[Battle of Kursk]]. He was alleged to be the fifth member of the [[Cambridge Five]].<ref>{{cite journal  |last=Barnes  |first=Julian E.  |title=Spy Stories: The Third Man |journal=U.S. News & World Report |page=46 |date=27 January 2003}}</ref> He is also notable as a translator and writer of non-fiction.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nCairncross' father was the manager of an [[Ironmongery|ironmongery]] and his mother a primary school teacher. John Cairncross was one of a family of eight, many of whom had distinguished careers. All three of his brothers became professors. One was the economist [[Alexander Cairncross (economist)|Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross]] (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist [[Frances Cairncross]] is his niece. Cairncross grew up in [[Lesmahagow]], a small town on the edge of moorland, near [[Lanark]] in the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]], and was educated at the [[Hamilton Academy]] (although his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize at Lesmahagow High School); the [[University of Glasgow]]; [[University of Paris|the Sorbonne]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied French and German.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/60115364.html?dids=60115364:60115364&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+13%2C+1998&author=&pub=The+Herald&desc=Plea+over+Scots+spy&pqatl=google] Scottish News Archive, The Herald, Glasgow, article 13 January 1998, ''Plea over Scots Spy'' \u2013 John Cairncross, \"a former pupil of Hamilton Academy\".

An article in the ''Glasgow Herald'' on 29 September 1936 noted that Cairncross had scored an \"outstanding double success of being placed 1st in the Home List and 1st in the competition for the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service,\" and that he had been placed fifth in the (Glasgow University) bursary competition of 1930, and was also a Scholar and Bell Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'', 29 September 1936.</ref>\n\nCairncross worked initially in the Cabinet Office as a private secretary to [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]], the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. Later he transferred to the [[British Foreign Office|Foreign Office]]. It has been suggested that in 1937, Cairncross joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB]], but he was not noted whilst at Cambridge for any political activity. He was regarded as rather austere and uncommunicative as an undergraduate.\n\n== Second World War ==\nIn 1942 and 1943 Cairncross worked in [[Government Code and Cypher School|GC&CS]], [[Bletchley Park]] on [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] [[cipher]]s.

Almost all raw transcripts were destroyed at the end of the war but a surviving transcript dated 25 April 1943 from [[German Army Group South]] signed by [[Maximilian von Weichs]] shows the high level of detail available to British intelligence officers.

In addition to German [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], [[Luftwaffe]], naval, railway, [[Army group]] and [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]] messages, GC&CS intercepted and decrypted [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] communications with [[Comintern]] and with the [[Soviet Union]]. Cairncross first in [[Hut 3]], then later at [[MI6]] HQ, had access to raw decrypts.

In 1944, Cairncross joined MI6, the foreign intelligence service. In Section V, the [[counter-intelligence]] section, Cairncross produced under the direction of [[Kim Philby]] an [[order of battle]] of the SS. Cairncross later suggested that he was unaware of Philby's connections with the Russians. In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence that \"I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders\".<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In March 1945, he was awarded a \u00a3 1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\n[[Yuri Modin]], the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with [[NATO]] in West Germany. He gives no date for this message.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But Cairncross was at the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1951 and NATO was established in April 1949. However, there was no such plan at this time and it was only much later that NATO obtained tactical nuclear weapons under US control in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This appears to have been a [[disinformation]] exercise.<ref name=\"Modin\">S.J.Hamrick (W.T.Tyler) ''Deceiving the Deceivers)'' ; Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2004.</ref>\n\nIn September 1951, he was questioned by British counterintelligence about his relationship with Maclean and the Communist Party.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross had been trained by the Soviets on how to behave during a counterintelligence interrogation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> On 23 October 1951, Cairncross informed his Soviet controller that he had merely explained to the interrogator that he did not hide his membership with the party and that he would merely greet Maclean when he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but did not maintain any contact with Maclean after graduation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> For security, the residence temporarily stopped contact with him, allowed him to continue to report monthly his situation with appropriate signals, and planned a follow up meeting on 23 January 1952.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The Soviets developed an exfiltration plan for Cairncross including funds, documents, and communication methods while living in other countries.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> However, Cairncross did not signal his controller until an early March 1952 meeting during which Cairncross stated that he had been interrogated again.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The residency did not have any more contact with Cairncross and instructed [[Kim Philby]] to determine Cairncross's whereabouts.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Philby could not determine the whereabouts of Cairncross.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross admitted to spying in 1951 after [[MI5]] found papers in [[Guy Burgess]]'s flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess's flight to Moscow. Philby had also informed the residency of this.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nSome believe that he may have supplied information about the Western [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] programme, the [[Manhattan Project]], to assist the Soviet nuclear programme.<ref name=mitrokhin>Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, ''The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West'', London, Penguin Books, 2000. note 13, p. 150</ref> It would have been surprising, though, if he had clearance to any useful engineering information, or that he would have understood it.

Martin]]. After Philby fled to [[Moscow]] in 1963, Martin reopened the files to hunt for the fourth and fifth men in 1964.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> To Martin's surprise, Cairncross made a full confession. Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt's confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities. The confession, conducted in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], was not made within British jurisdiction or under caution and would therefore have been inadmissable in court.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Davenport-Hines |title=Enemies Within |year=2018 |page=546}}</ref> After the counterintelligence proceedings were completed, he was allowed to travel abroad and moved to Canada where he worked as a teacher.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nIn 1967,<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross moved to [[Rome]], where he worked for the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] (BNL), [[Banca d'Italia]] and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] of 1980\u20131988, petroleum's strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross about the bank's role in that area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, [[Barrie Penrose]], a journalist, concluded that Cairncross was the \"fifth man\" and confronted him. Cairncross' third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and iwa living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> His status as the \"fifth man\" was supported years later by [[Oleg Gordievsky]], the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer [[Gayle Brinkerhoff]]. Later that year he died after suffering a stroke, at the age of 82.<ref name=Independent10101995>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-john-cairncross-1576877.html |title=Obituary, John Cairncross |work=[[The Independent]] |last=Bower |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Bower |date=10 October 1995 |access-date=15 November 2010 |archive-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115140256/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-john-cairncross-1576877.html}}</ref>\n\nCairncross' autobiography, ''The Enigma Spy'', was published in 1997.

As a Soviet [[double agent]], he passed to the [[Soviet Union]] the raw [[Tunny (cryptography)|Tunny]] decryptions that influenced the [[Battle of Kursk]]. He was alleged to be the fifth member of the [[Cambridge Five]].<ref>{{cite journal  |last=Barnes  |first=Julian E.  |title=Spy Stories: The Third Man |journal=U.S. News & World Report |page=46 |date=27 January 2003}}</ref> He is also notable as a translator and writer of non-fiction.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nCairncross' father was the manager of an [[Ironmongery|ironmongery]] and his mother a primary school teacher. John Cairncross was one of a family of eight, many of whom had distinguished careers. All three of his brothers became professors. One was the economist [[Alexander Cairncross (economist)|Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross]] (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist [[Frances Cairncross]] is his niece. Cairncross grew up in [[Lesmahagow]], a small town on the edge of moorland, near [[Lanark]] in the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]], and was educated at the [[Hamilton Academy]] (although his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize at Lesmahagow High School); the [[University of Glasgow]]; [[University of Paris|the Sorbonne]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied French and German.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/60115364.html?dids=60115364:60115364&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+13%2C+1998&author=&pub=The+Herald&desc=Plea+over+Scots+spy&pqatl=google] Scottish News Archive, The Herald, Glasgow, article 13 January 1998, ''Plea over Scots Spy'' \u2013 John Cairncross, \"a former pupil of Hamilton Academy\".

An article in the ''Glasgow Herald'' on 29 September 1936 noted that Cairncross had scored an \"outstanding double success of being placed 1st in the Home List and 1st in the competition for the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service,\" and that he had been placed fifth in the (Glasgow University) bursary competition of 1930, and was also a Scholar and Bell Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'', 29 September 1936.</ref>\n\nCairncross worked initially in the Cabinet Office as a private secretary to [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]], the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. Later he transferred to the [[British Foreign Office|Foreign Office]]. It has been suggested that in 1937, Cairncross joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB]], but he was not noted whilst at Cambridge for any political activity. He was regarded as rather austere and uncommunicative as an undergraduate.\n\n== Second World War ==\nIn 1942 and 1943 Cairncross worked in [[Government Code and Cypher School|GC&CS]], [[Bletchley Park]] on [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] [[cipher]]s.

In addition to German [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], [[Luftwaffe]], naval, railway, [[Army group]] and [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]] messages, GC&CS intercepted and decrypted [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] communications with [[Comintern]] and with the [[Soviet Union]]. Cairncross first in [[Hut 3]], then later at [[MI6]] HQ, had access to raw decrypts.

In 1944, Cairncross joined MI6, the foreign intelligence service. In Section V, the [[counter-intelligence]] section, Cairncross produced under the direction of [[Kim Philby]] an [[order of battle]] of the SS. Cairncross later suggested that he was unaware of Philby's connections with the Russians. In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence that \"I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders\".<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In March 1945, he was awarded a \u00a3 1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\n[[Yuri Modin]], the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with [[NATO]] in West Germany. He gives no date for this message.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But Cairncross was at the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1951 and NATO was established in April 1949. However, there was no such plan at this time and it was only much later that NATO obtained tactical nuclear weapons under US control in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This appears to have been a [[disinformation]] exercise.<ref name=\"Modin\">S.J.Hamrick (W.T.Tyler) ''Deceiving the Deceivers)'' ; Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2004.</ref>\n\nIn September 1951, he was questioned by British counterintelligence about his relationship with Maclean and the Communist Party.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross had been trained by the Soviets on how to behave during a counterintelligence interrogation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> On 23 October 1951, Cairncross informed his Soviet controller that he had merely explained to the interrogator that he did not hide his membership with the party and that he would merely greet Maclean when he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but did not maintain any contact with Maclean after graduation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> For security, the residence temporarily stopped contact with him, allowed him to continue to report monthly his situation with appropriate signals, and planned a follow up meeting on 23 January 1952.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The Soviets developed an exfiltration plan for Cairncross including funds, documents, and communication methods while living in other countries.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> However, Cairncross did not signal his controller until an early March 1952 meeting during which Cairncross stated that he had been interrogated again.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The residency did not have any more contact with Cairncross and instructed [[Kim Philby]] to determine Cairncross's whereabouts.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Philby could not determine the whereabouts of Cairncross.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross admitted to spying in 1951 after [[MI5]] found papers in [[Guy Burgess]]'s flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess's flight to Moscow.

Martin]]. After Philby fled to [[Moscow]] in 1963, Martin reopened the files to hunt for the fourth and fifth men in 1964.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> To Martin's surprise, Cairncross made a full confession. Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt's confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities. The confession, conducted in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], was not made within British jurisdiction or under caution and would therefore have been inadmissable in court.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Davenport-Hines |title=Enemies Within |year=2018 |page=546}}</ref> After the counterintelligence proceedings were completed, he was allowed to travel abroad and moved to Canada where he worked as a teacher.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nIn 1967,<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross moved to [[Rome]], where he worked for the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] (BNL), [[Banca d'Italia]] and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] of 1980\u20131988, petroleum's strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross about the bank's role in that area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, [[Barrie Penrose]], a journalist, concluded that Cairncross was the \"fifth man\" and confronted him. Cairncross' third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] informed parliament that Cairncross is a Soviet agent and is living with his wife in the west of England while he writes his memoirs.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> His status as the \"fifth man\" was supported years later by [[Oleg Gordievsky]], the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer [[Gayle Brinkerhoff]].

Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co. (MISCO), which provided the monolithic shell process, which uses a ceramic shell with thin, strong walls to increase control of the solidification process to produce a sounder [[casting]].\n\nHowe became Howmet in 1965, marking a transition from a mining company to a manufacturer of precision metal products. Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit. In 2004, Howmet was merged to form the Alcoa Investment Casting and Forged Products unit. In 2007, Howmet was renamed Alcoa Howmet as a division of the newly formed Alcoa Power and Propulsion unit. \n\n[[File:Howmet Castings-Alcoa Logo.gif|200px|thumbnail|left|Howmet Alcoa Logo]] On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. spun off its bauxite, alumina, and aluminum operations to a new company called Alcoa Corp.

Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co. (MISCO), which provided the monolithic shell process, which uses a ceramic shell with thin, strong walls to increase control of the solidification process to produce a sounder [[casting]].\n\nHowe became Howmet in 1965, marking a transition from a mining company to a manufacturer of precision metal products. Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit. In 2004, Howmet was merged to form the Alcoa Investment Casting and Forged Products unit. In 2007, Howmet was renamed Alcoa Howmet as a division of the newly formed Alcoa Power and Propulsion unit. \n\n[[File:Howmet Castings-Alcoa Logo.gif|200px|thumbnail|left|Howmet Alcoa Logo]] On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. spun off its bauxite, alumina, and aluminum operations to a new company called Alcoa Corp.

''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], but the manuscript was smuggled to Italy for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-declassifies-agency-role-in-publishing-doctor-zhivago.html|title=CIA Declassifies Agency Role in Publishing Doctor Zhivago \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event that enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were able to accept it in his name in 1988.

His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from [[Isaac Abarbanel]], the famous 15th-century [[Sephardic Jewish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Rabbinic commentaries|Bible commentator]], and treasurer of [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Barnes|author2=Christopher J.

Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n\nIn a 1959 letter to Jacqueline de Proyart, Pasternak recalled,\n\n{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted. I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness. Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910\u201312, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness \u2013 my way of seeing things, the world, life \u2013 were taking shape...<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 137.</ref>}}\n\nShortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement. Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, \"my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit.\"<ref>Pasternak (1959) p 25</ref>\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak in youth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak c. 1908]]\nIn a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Past28\"/> The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,\n\n{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station. Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove. The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up. The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor.<ref name=\"Past28\">Pasternak (1959) pp 27\u201328.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Max Hayward]], \"In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''.</ref>\n\nRegular visitors to the Pasternaks' home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician.<ref>Pasternak (1967)</ref> Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Olga Freidenberg ===\nIn 1910 Pasternak was reunited with his cousin, [[Olga Freidenberg]] (1890\u20131955). They had shared the same nursery but had been separated when the Freidenberg family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. They fell in love immediately but were never lovers. The romance however is made clear from their letters, Pasternak writing:<blockquote>\u2018You do not know how my tormenting feeling grew and grew until it became obvious to me and to others. As you walked beside me with complete detachment, I could not express it to you. It was a rare sort of closeness, as if we two, you and I, were in love with something that was utterly indifferent to both of us, something that remained aloof from us by virtue of its extraordinary inability to adapt to the other side of life.'</blockquote>The cousins' initial passion developed into a lifelong close friendship. From 1910 Pasternak and Freidenberg exchanged frequent letters, and their correspondence lasted over 40 years until 1954. The cousins last met in 1936.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ivka.rsuh.ru/binary/85345_30.1476388407.9268.pdf|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|author=Nina V.

Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 395.</ref>\n\nAlthough Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem \"Marburg\" (1917):<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished.\nI shook. I had made a proposal\u2014but late,\nToo late. I was scared, and she had refused me.\nI pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''My Sister, Life''. His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets.\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak in the 1920s]]\nDuring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in Vsevolodovo-Vilve near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. According to [[Max Hayward]],\n\n{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918\u20131920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time. No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the \"splendid surgery\" of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but \u2013 again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the 9th Congress of Soviets in 1921 \u2013 he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule. The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the \"[[bourgeois]]\" [[intelligentsia]]. In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread. He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish. The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several \"literary\" cafes which then sprang up, or \u2013 anticipating [[samizdat]] \u2013 to circulate it in manuscript. It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p xxiii.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|Pasternak (second from left) in 1924, with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (centre)]]\nWhen it finally was published in 1922, Pasternak's ''My Sister, Life'' revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.\n\nFollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=John Bayley|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably \"The Childhood of Luvers\" and \"Safe Conduct\".\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak with family 1920s.jpg|thumb|Pasternak with Evgeniya Lurye and son]]\nIn 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435), a student at the Art Institute. The following year they had a son, Evgenii.\n\nEvidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his poem \"In Memory of Reissner\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/reissner/works/hamburg/app3.htm |title=In Memory of Reissner |last1=Pasternak |first1=Boris |last2= |first2= |date=1926|website=marxists.org |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader [[Larisa Reisner]] aged 30 in February of that year.\n\nBy 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921\u20131960,'' p 78.</ref> In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, \"break off relations,\" with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,\n\n{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling. In fact, they've fallen short of it but \u2013 difficult as it is for me to understand \u2013 a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility. Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity. And these men are ruled by trivial routine. Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious. But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions. I'm not out on my own \u2013 people treat me well. But all that only holds good up to a point. It seems to me that I've reached that point.<ref>Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921\u20131960'', p 80.</ref>}}\n\nBy 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.\n\nIn 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus]]. They both got divorces and married two years later.\n\nHe continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943).\n\n===Stalin Epigram===\nIn April 1934 [[Osip Mandelstam]] recited his \"[[Stalin Epigram]]\" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: \"I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61\u201363</ref>\n\nOn the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.\n\nSoon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, \"Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/> According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. \"He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'\" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an \"eager fumbling manner\" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: \"I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,\" and put down the receiver.<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/>\n\n===Great Purge===\n{{Main|Great Purge}}\nAccording to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. [[Vladimir Stavsky|Vladimir Stavski]], the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at [[Peredelkino]] and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his [[dacha]]. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an [[NKVD]] agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nSoon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin. He wrote about his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions, which he still held dear. He declared that his own life was at the Leader's disposal. He said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be instantly arrested, but he was not.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\"/> Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the [[Great Purge]]. According to Pasternak, Stalin declared, \"Do not touch this cloud dweller\" (or, in another version, \"Leave that [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] alone!\")<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>\n\nAlthough Pasternak was never arrested by the [[Soviet secret police]], his close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] fell victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the [[suicides]] of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his entire life.\n\nIvinskaya wrote, \"I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]].\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 135.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.<ref name=\"Ivin72\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore it well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.<ref name=\"Ivin72\"/>\n\nWith the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s. [[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]].<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 75.</ref>\n\nPasternak later said, \"If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Allies of World War II|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 80.</ref>\n\n===Olga Ivinskaya===\nIn October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a 34 year old single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''. Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3.</ref> Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, \"He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was \"busy today.\" But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask.\"\n\nShe gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 12.</ref>\n\nWhen they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Pet\u0151fi with the inscription, \"Pet\u0151fi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948.\"\n\nPasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, \"Pet\u0151fi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 27.</ref> Ivinskaya would later describe the Pet\u0151fi translations as, \"a first declaration of love.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 28.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.\n\nIvinskaya later recalled,\n\n{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up. After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me. By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, \"Our Shop.\"\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]].\n\nUpon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]. She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]. Weeping, Pasternak told her, \"Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, \"After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]\u2014who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\"/>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, \"She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 109.</ref>\n\n===Translating Goethe===\nPasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''. The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s \"progressive\" meanings to support \"the reactionary theory of 'pure art'\", as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, \"irrational,\" had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked.<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\n===Khrushchev thaw===\nWhen Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, \"Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 144.</ref>\n\nAfter her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, \"For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities.\"<ref name=\"Ivin142\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 142.</ref> During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, \"vividly reminded\" him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name=\"Ivin142\"/>\n\n===''Doctor Zhivago''===\n\nAlthough it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [[Novy Mir]], which refused publication due to its rejection of [[socialist realism]].<ref>\"Doctor Zhivago\": Letter to Boris Pasternak from the Editors of ''Novyi Mir''. Daedalus, Vol. 89, No. 3, The Russian Intelligentsia (Summer, 1960), pp.&nbsp;648\u2013668</ref> The author, like his [[protagonist]] [[Yuri Zhivago]], showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the \"progress\" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/world/doctor-zhivago-to-see-print-in-soviet-in-88.html|title='Doctor Zhivago' to See Print in Soviet in '88|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=13 February 1987|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 February 2019|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]].\n\nPasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio D'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, D'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told D'Angelo with a laugh, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"<ref>Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.<ref>Fleishman, pp 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published.<ref>Fleishman, p 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, \"He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world \u2013 this would be an even greater crime.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 203.</ref> The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nHelped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world \u2013 see \"Nobel Prize\" section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, \"No matter. I am above race...\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 136.</ref> According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Fleishman, pp 264\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThe first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.\n\nIvinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, \"I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, \"giant of the pre-Christian era.\" Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, \"a form of protest.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 134.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908\u201310 manufacture.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 231.</ref> Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 230.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''. She had said, \"Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the [[Russian people]] and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen.\"<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1912\u20131960,'' p 403.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize===\n[[File:Miniature Volume of Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Copy of the original Russian-language edition of ''Doctor Zhivago'', covertly published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

According to the former Nobel Committee head [[Lars Gyllensten]], his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity\u2026'\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ |title=Boris Pasternak: Nobel Prize, Son's Memoirs |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British [[MI6]] and the American [[CIA]] lent a hand to ensure that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was submitted to the [[Nobel Committee]] in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]].

Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.\n\nOn 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in \"continuing the great Russian epic tradition.\" On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: \"Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 221.</ref> That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel.

Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane. On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders. Semishastny first called Pasternak, \"a mangy sheep,\" who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, \"his slanderous so-called work.\" Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, \"this man went and spat in the face of the people.\" And he concluded with, \"If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,\" because a pig, \"never shits where it eats.\" Khrushchev applauded demonstratively. News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide. It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, \"typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding.\"<ref>Solomon Volkov, ''The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn'', Alfred A.

In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]],\n\n{{quote|I am addressing you personally, the C.C. of the C.P.S.S., and the Soviet Government. From Comrade Semichastny's speech I learn that the government, 'would not put any obstacles in the way of my departure from the U.S.S.R.' For me this is impossible. I am tied to Russia by birth, by my life and work. I cannot conceive of my destiny separate from Russia, or outside it. Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West. Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize. Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me. With my hand on my heart, I can say that I have done something for Soviet literature, and may still be of use to it.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 240\u2013241.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Oak and the Calf'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] sharply criticized Pasternak, both for declining the Nobel Prize and for sending such a letter to Khrushchev. In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, \"She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him.\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, \"his Capitalist paradise.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251\u2013261.</ref> According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting. [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to organize a Committee for Pasternak's protection.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bill Mauldin]] produced [[:File:I won the Nobel Prize for Literature.jpg|a cartoon about Pasternak]] that won the 1959 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].

The film, which toured in the [[roadshow]] tradition, starred [[Omar Sharif]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], and [[Julie Christie]]. Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]].\n\nIn 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred [[Hans Matheson]], [[Alexandra Maria Lara]], [[Keira Knightley]], and [[Sam Neill]].\n\nThe Russian TV version of 2006, directed by [[Aleksandr Proshkin]] and starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\n\n====Thoughts on poetry====\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|In Pasternak the 'all-powerful god of detail' always, it seems, revolted against the idea of turning out verse for its own sake or to convey vague personal moods. If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word \u2013 otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all. Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell \u2013 only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made \u2013 that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism. [Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics \u2013 all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 145.</ref>}}\n\nFor this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, \"It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\"/>\n\nAlso according to Ivinskaya, \"'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed \u2013 by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there \u2013 it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 146.</ref>\n\n====Translation====\nReluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]. [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, \"Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, \"I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth-century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.<ref name=\"Ivin28\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nPasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')<ref>Boris Pasternak (1959) ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books. p 127.</ref> remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of \"pasternakizing\" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, \"Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience.\"<ref>Pasternak, (1959) p 142.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this \u2013 ''[[:s:fr:Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)|Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 34.</ref>}}\n\nWhile they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, \"1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>\n\nLater, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original \u2013 an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:\n\n{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, \"Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence.\" It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak... What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends. \"What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?\" [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this. \"I am silent because I am not printed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 35.</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nBoris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a [[dacha]] (country house) close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No. 3]] (''The Divine Poem''), in 1903.\n\nPasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but \u2013 inspired by Scriabin \u2013 he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Aleksandr Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year.\n\nPasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Rayki, some 40&nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (N.B. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 20&nbsp;km south-west of the capital.)\n\n==Selected books by Pasternak==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Twin in the Clouds'' (1914)\n*''Over the Barriers'' (1916)\n*''Themes and Variations'' (1917)\n*''My Sister, Life'' (1922)\n*''On Early Trains'' (1944)\n*''Selected Poems'' (1946)\n*''Poems'' (1954)\n*''When the Weather Clears'' (1959)\n*''In The Interlude: Poems 1945\u20131960'' (1962)\n\n===Books of prose===\n*''Safe Conduct'' (1931)\n*''Second Birth'' (1932)\n*''[[The Last Summer (Pasternak novella)|The Last Summer]]'' (1934)\n*''Childhood'' (1941)\n*''Selected Writings'' (1949)\n*''Collected Works'' (1945)\n*''Goethe's Faust'' (1952)\n*''Essay in Autobiography'' (1956)\n*''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember; Sketches for an Autobiography'', [[Pantheon Books]], 1959.\n* Boris Pasternak. \"Sister, My Life\" Translated by C.

Composed in 1917, Pasternak's first book of poems, ''My Sister, Life'', was published in Berlin in 1922 and soon became an important collection in the [[Russian language]]. Pasternak's translations of [[stage play]]s by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] remain very popular with Russian audiences.\n\nPasternak is also known as the author of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957), a novel that takes place between the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the [[Second World War]]. ''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], but the manuscript was smuggled to Italy for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-declassifies-agency-role-in-publishing-doctor-zhivago.html|title=CIA Declassifies Agency Role in Publishing Doctor Zhivago \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event that enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were able to accept it in his name in 1988.

His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from [[Isaac Abarbanel]], the famous 15th-century [[Sephardic Jewish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Rabbinic commentaries|Bible commentator]], and treasurer of [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Barnes|author2=Christopher J.

Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n\nIn a 1959 letter to Jacqueline de Proyart, Pasternak recalled,\n\n{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted. I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness. Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910\u201312, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness \u2013 my way of seeing things, the world, life \u2013 were taking shape...<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 137.</ref>}}\n\nShortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement. Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, \"my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit.\"<ref>Pasternak (1959) p 25</ref>\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak in youth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak c. 1908]]\nIn a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Past28\"/> The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,\n\n{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station. Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove. The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up. The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor.<ref name=\"Past28\">Pasternak (1959) pp 27\u201328.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Max Hayward]], \"In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''.</ref>\n\nRegular visitors to the Pasternaks' home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician.<ref>Pasternak (1967)</ref> Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Olga Freidenberg ===\nIn 1910 Pasternak was reunited with his cousin, [[Olga Freidenberg]] (1890\u20131955). They had shared the same nursery but had been separated when the Freidenberg family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. They fell in love immediately but were never lovers. The romance however is made clear from their letters, Pasternak writing:<blockquote>\u2018You do not know how my tormenting feeling grew and grew until it became obvious to me and to others. As you walked beside me with complete detachment, I could not express it to you. It was a rare sort of closeness, as if we two, you and I, were in love with something that was utterly indifferent to both of us, something that remained aloof from us by virtue of its extraordinary inability to adapt to the other side of life.'</blockquote>The cousins' initial passion developed into a lifelong close friendship. From 1910 Pasternak and Freidenberg exchanged frequent letters, and their correspondence lasted over 40 years until 1954. The cousins last met in 1936.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ivka.rsuh.ru/binary/85345_30.1476388407.9268.pdf|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|author=Nina V.

Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 395.</ref>\n\nAlthough Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem \"Marburg\" (1917):<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished.\nI shook. I had made a proposal\u2014but late,\nToo late. I was scared, and she had refused me.\nI pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''My Sister, Life''. His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets.\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak in the 1920s]]\nDuring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in Vsevolodovo-Vilve near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. According to [[Max Hayward]],\n\n{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918\u20131920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time. No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the \"splendid surgery\" of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but \u2013 again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the 9th Congress of Soviets in 1921 \u2013 he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule. The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the \"[[bourgeois]]\" [[intelligentsia]]. In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread. He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish. The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several \"literary\" cafes which then sprang up, or \u2013 anticipating [[samizdat]] \u2013 to circulate it in manuscript. It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p xxiii.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|Pasternak (second from left) in 1924, with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (centre)]]\nWhen it finally was published in 1922, Pasternak's ''My Sister, Life'' revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.\n\nFollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=John Bayley|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably \"The Childhood of Luvers\" and \"Safe Conduct\".\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak with family 1920s.jpg|thumb|Pasternak with Evgeniya Lurye and son]]\nIn 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435), a student at the Art Institute. The following year they had a son, Evgenii.\n\nEvidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his poem \"In Memory of Reissner\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/reissner/works/hamburg/app3.htm |title=In Memory of Reissner |last1=Pasternak |first1=Boris |last2= |first2= |date=1926|website=marxists.org |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader [[Larisa Reisner]] aged 30 in February of that year.\n\nBy 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921\u20131960,'' p 78.</ref> In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, \"break off relations,\" with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,\n\n{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling. In fact, they've fallen short of it but \u2013 difficult as it is for me to understand \u2013 a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility. Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity. And these men are ruled by trivial routine. Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious. But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions. I'm not out on my own \u2013 people treat me well. But all that only holds good up to a point. It seems to me that I've reached that point.<ref>Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921\u20131960'', p 80.</ref>}}\n\nBy 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.\n\nIn 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus]]. They both got divorces and married two years later.\n\nHe continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943).\n\n===Stalin Epigram===\nIn April 1934 [[Osip Mandelstam]] recited his \"[[Stalin Epigram]]\" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: \"I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61\u201363</ref>\n\nOn the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.\n\nSoon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, \"Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/> According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. \"He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'\" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an \"eager fumbling manner\" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: \"I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,\" and put down the receiver.<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/>\n\n===Great Purge===\n{{Main|Great Purge}}\nAccording to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. [[Vladimir Stavsky|Vladimir Stavski]], the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at [[Peredelkino]] and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his [[dacha]]. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an [[NKVD]] agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nSoon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin. He wrote about his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions, which he still held dear. He declared that his own life was at the Leader's disposal. He said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be instantly arrested, but he was not.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\"/> Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the [[Great Purge]]. According to Pasternak, Stalin declared, \"Do not touch this cloud dweller\" (or, in another version, \"Leave that [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] alone!\")<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>\n\nAlthough Pasternak was never arrested by the [[Soviet secret police]], his close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] fell victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the [[suicides]] of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his entire life.\n\nIvinskaya wrote, \"I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]].\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 135.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.<ref name=\"Ivin72\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore it well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.<ref name=\"Ivin72\"/>\n\nWith the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s. [[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]].<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 75.</ref>\n\nPasternak later said, \"If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Allies of World War II|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 80.</ref>\n\n===Olga Ivinskaya===\nIn October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a 34 year old single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''. Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3.</ref> Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, \"He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was \"busy today.\" But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask.\"\n\nShe gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 12.</ref>\n\nWhen they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Pet\u0151fi with the inscription, \"Pet\u0151fi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948.\"\n\nPasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, \"Pet\u0151fi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 27.</ref> Ivinskaya would later describe the Pet\u0151fi translations as, \"a first declaration of love.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 28.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.\n\nIvinskaya later recalled,\n\n{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up. After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me. By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, \"Our Shop.\"\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]].\n\nUpon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]. She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]. Weeping, Pasternak told her, \"Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, \"After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]\u2014who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\"/>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, \"She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 109.</ref>\n\n===Translating Goethe===\nPasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''. The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s \"progressive\" meanings to support \"the reactionary theory of 'pure art'\", as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, \"irrational,\" had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked.<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\n===Khrushchev thaw===\nWhen Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, \"Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 144.</ref>\n\nAfter her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, \"For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities.\"<ref name=\"Ivin142\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 142.</ref> During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, \"vividly reminded\" him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name=\"Ivin142\"/>\n\n===''Doctor Zhivago''===\n\nAlthough it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [[Novy Mir]], which refused publication due to its rejection of [[socialist realism]].<ref>\"Doctor Zhivago\": Letter to Boris Pasternak from the Editors of ''Novyi Mir''. Daedalus, Vol. 89, No. 3, The Russian Intelligentsia (Summer, 1960), pp.&nbsp;648\u2013668</ref> The author, like his [[protagonist]] [[Yuri Zhivago]], showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the \"progress\" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/world/doctor-zhivago-to-see-print-in-soviet-in-88.html|title='Doctor Zhivago' to See Print in Soviet in '88|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=13 February 1987|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 February 2019|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]].\n\nPasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio D'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, D'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told D'Angelo with a laugh, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"<ref>Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.<ref>Fleishman, pp 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published.<ref>Fleishman, p 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, \"He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world \u2013 this would be an even greater crime.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 203.</ref> The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nHelped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world \u2013 see \"Nobel Prize\" section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, \"No matter. I am above race...\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 136.</ref> According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Fleishman, pp 264\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThe first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.\n\nIvinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, \"I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, \"giant of the pre-Christian era.\" Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, \"a form of protest.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 134.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908\u201310 manufacture.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 231.</ref> Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 230.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''. She had said, \"Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the [[Russian people]] and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen.\"<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1912\u20131960,'' p 403.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize===\n[[File:Miniature Volume of Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Copy of the original Russian-language edition of ''Doctor Zhivago'', covertly published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

According to the former Nobel Committee head [[Lars Gyllensten]], his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity\u2026'\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ |title=Boris Pasternak: Nobel Prize, Son's Memoirs |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British [[MI6]] and the American [[CIA]] lent a hand to ensure that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was submitted to the [[Nobel Committee]] in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]].

Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.\n\nOn 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in \"continuing the great Russian epic tradition.\" On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: \"Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 221.</ref> That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel.

Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane. On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders. Semishastny first called Pasternak, \"a mangy sheep,\" who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, \"his slanderous so-called work.\" Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, \"this man went and spat in the face of the people.\" And he concluded with, \"If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,\" because a pig, \"never shits where it eats.\" Khrushchev applauded demonstratively. News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide. It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, \"typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding.\"<ref>Solomon Volkov, ''The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn'', Alfred A.

Furthermore, he was threatened at the very least with formal exile to the West. In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]],\n\n{{quote|I am addressing you personally, the C.C. of the C.P.S.S., and the Soviet Government. From Comrade Semichastny's speech I learn that the government, 'would not put any obstacles in the way of my departure from the U.S.S.R.' For me this is impossible. I am tied to Russia by birth, by my life and work. I cannot conceive of my destiny separate from Russia, or outside it. Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West. Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize. Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me. With my hand on my heart, I can say that I have done something for Soviet literature, and may still be of use to it.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 240\u2013241.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Oak and the Calf'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] sharply criticized Pasternak, both for declining the Nobel Prize and for sending such a letter to Khrushchev. In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, \"She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him.\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, \"his Capitalist paradise.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251\u2013261.</ref> According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting. [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to organize a Committee for Pasternak's protection.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bill Mauldin]] produced [[:File:I won the Nobel Prize for Literature.jpg|a cartoon about Pasternak]] that won the 1959 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].

The film, which toured in the [[roadshow]] tradition, starred [[Omar Sharif]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], and [[Julie Christie]]. Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]].\n\nIn 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred [[Hans Matheson]], [[Alexandra Maria Lara]], [[Keira Knightley]], and [[Sam Neill]].\n\nThe Russian TV version of 2006, directed by [[Aleksandr Proshkin]] and starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\n\n====Thoughts on poetry====\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|In Pasternak the 'all-powerful god of detail' always, it seems, revolted against the idea of turning out verse for its own sake or to convey vague personal moods. If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word \u2013 otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all. Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell \u2013 only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made \u2013 that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism. [Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics \u2013 all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 145.</ref>}}\n\nFor this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, \"It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\"/>\n\nAlso according to Ivinskaya, \"'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed \u2013 by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there \u2013 it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 146.</ref>\n\n====Translation====\nReluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]. [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, \"Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, \"I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth-century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.<ref name=\"Ivin28\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nPasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')<ref>Boris Pasternak (1959) ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books. p 127.</ref> remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of \"pasternakizing\" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, \"Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience.\"<ref>Pasternak, (1959) p 142.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this \u2013 ''[[:s:fr:Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)|Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 34.</ref>}}\n\nWhile they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, \"1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>\n\nLater, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original \u2013 an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:\n\n{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, \"Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence.\" It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak... What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends. \"What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?\" [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this. \"I am silent because I am not printed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 35.</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nBoris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a [[dacha]] (country house) close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No. 3]] (''The Divine Poem''), in 1903.\n\nPasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but \u2013 inspired by Scriabin \u2013 he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Aleksandr Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year.\n\nPasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Rayki, some 40&nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (N.B. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 20&nbsp;km south-west of the capital.)\n\n==Selected books by Pasternak==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Twin in the Clouds'' (1914)\n*''Over the Barriers'' (1916)\n*''Themes and Variations'' (1917)\n*''My Sister, Life'' (1922)\n*''On Early Trains'' (1944)\n*''Selected Poems'' (1946)\n*''Poems'' (1954)\n*''When the Weather Clears'' (1959)\n*''In The Interlude: Poems 1945\u20131960'' (1962)\n\n===Books of prose===\n*''Safe Conduct'' (1931)\n*''Second Birth'' (1932)\n*''[[The Last Summer (Pasternak novella)|The Last Summer]]'' (1934)\n*''Childhood'' (1941)\n*''Selected Writings'' (1949)\n*''Collected Works'' (1945)\n*''Goethe's Faust'' (1952)\n*''Essay in Autobiography'' (1956)\n*''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember; Sketches for an Autobiography'', [[Pantheon Books]], 1959.\n* Boris Pasternak. \"Sister, My Life\" Translated by C.

[[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.</ref> Thus, while its status as a fourth source of law was accepted by the majority of later and modern Muslim jurists, this was not the case at the inception of Muslim jurisprudence as a field.\n\nOpposition to qiyas came from a number of angles. [[Professor]] Wal\u00eed b. Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem al-`Ujaj\u00ee [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] explains the opposition to qiyas as coming from multiple angles:<ref name=walid/>\n\n:Some of them argued that qiy\u00e2s is contrary to reason. One argument given in this light was that: \u201cDelving into this method is intellectually repugnant in its own right\u201d. Another argument was: \u201cIslamic legal rulings are based on human well-being, and no one knows human well-being except the One who gave us the sacred law. Therefore, the only way we can know the sacred law is from the revelation.\u201d Other scholars said that qiy\u00e2s is not contrary to reason, but prohibited by the sacred law itself.\n\n[https://menas.arizona.edu/user/scott-lucas Scott Lucas], when mentioning Ahmad Dallal\u2019s position on Salafism, states that Dallal:\n:...declared that Salafism \"is better understood as a method of thinking of, or an approach to, authoritative sources than as a distinct school of thought\" that includes the elevation of the Qur\u2019an and sound hadith at the expense of the opinions attributed to the eponyms of the four Sunni schools and the rejection (or sever curtailment) of qiyas<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B.

Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Their Relationship to Classical Salafi Islam|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2006|volume=13|issue=3|page=290}}</ref> Scott Lucas states that Bukhari\u2019s rejection of qiyas was placed within the context of what Bukhari perceived as invalid techniques of ijtihad, which included religious innovation (bid\u2019a), ra\u2019y, and tamthil. \n\nLucas also points out common mistakes other scholars make when analyzing Bukhari\u2019s position on qiyas. The biggest source of confusion for scholars is the fact that, while rejecting qiyas, Bukhari accepts the idea of tashbih (comparison), which seems similar to analogy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Their Relationship to Classical Salafi Islam|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2006|volume=13|issue=3|page=307\u2013309}}</ref> However, this is not the case, as tashbih is a comparison used in explanation (such as a metaphor), whereas qiyas applies a specific legal ruling to another case. \n\nBukhari is also known for his criticism of those who say that the Prophet used qiyas, and he devoted a section of his Sahih to the topic. Bukhari states:\n\n:If the Prophet was asked about something about which he had not received a revelation, he either said, \u2018I do not know\u2019 or did not reply until he received a revelation. he did not [reply] by means of ra\u2019y or qiyas, due to the [Qur\u2019anic] verse, \"\u2026in accordance to what God has shown you\" (4:105).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ibn Hajr|title=Fath al-bari|location=15:263}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B.

With the Malikite and Hanbalite schools eventually granting full acceptance as the Hanafites and Shafi'ites already had done, the overwhelming majority of Sunni jurists from the late period onward affirmed its validity.<ref name=hisham/> [[Japan]]ese scholar of Islam [[Kojiro Nakamura]] defined the orthodox Sunni schools in regard to their eventual acceptance of analogy in descending order of that acceptance: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is, Hanbalis and Zahiris.<ref name=kojiro/> Much work was performed on the details of proper analogy, with major figures such as [[Al-Qastallani]], [[Al-Baqillani]], [[Al-Juwayni]] and [[Sayf al-Din al-Amidi|al-Amidi]] from the [[Shafi'i]]te school and [[Ibn Abidin]] from the [[Hanafi]]te school providing rules and guidelines still used to this day.\n\n===Application as a source of law===\nSunni scholar [[Baghawi]] gave a commonly accepted definition of analogy in Islamic law: analogical reasoning is the knowledge by which one learns the method of deriving a ruling from the Quran and prophetic tradition. In this case, the above-mentioned ruling should not already be apparent in the Quran, prophetic tradition or consensus. If there is no derivation involved due to the explicitness of the ruling in the Quran and prophetic tradition, then such a person is not, by definition, a mujtahid.\n\n==Shi\u2019a interpretations==\nNot unlike the Sunni [[Hanbali]]s and [[Zahiri]]s, the Shi\u2019a rejected both pure reason and analogical reason completely on account of the multitude of perspectives that would arise from it, viewing both methods as subjective.<ref name=mansoor/> There are various instances in which the Qur'an disapproves of a divergence of beliefs such as the following:\n{{Quote|And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:|Sura 8 ([[Al-Anfal]]), [[ayah]] 46}}<ref>{{Cite quran|8|46|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n===Twelver Shi\u2019a===\nWithin the [[Twelver]] Shi\u2019i legal tradition, the fourth source for deriving legal principles is not qiy\u0101s but rather the intellect ''\u2019\u2019[['Aql]]\u2019\u2019''. Twelver Shi\u2019a regard the ''[[ulama]]'' (scholars) as authorities in legal and religious matters during [[the Occultation]] (''ghayba'') of the [[Imamah (Shi'a Twelver doctrine)|Imamah]] [[Mahdi]]. Until the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|hidden Imam]], it is the responsibility of the ''ul\u0101ma\u2019'' to be his deputies and provide guidance on worldly matters. In modern interpretations of Twelver Shi\u2019ism, the most revered and learned scholars are styled as references for emulation ''([[Marja' (Islamic law)|marja taql\u012bd]]''). This system of deriving legal principles effectively replaces both the Sunni notion of consensus ''(ijm\u0101\u2019)'' and deductive analogy ''(qiy\u0101s)''<ref>Elhadj, Elie. The Islamic Shield: Arab Resistance to Democratic and Religious Reforms (Boca Raton: [[Brown Walker Press]]), 2007, p.48.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, in the chapter on Knowledge of the Twelver collection of prophetic traditions, [[Kitab al-Kafi]], one finds many traditions cited from the Imams that forbid the use of ''qiy\u0101s'', for example:\n{{Quote|The Imam (a.s.) said, \"My father narrated from my great-great-great-great grandfather, the holy Prophet (s.a.) who said, \u2018Those who act on the basis of analogy will face their destruction and lead others to their destruction. Those who give fatwas without the knowledge of the abrogating and the abrogated, the clear text and that which requires interpretation, they will face destruction and lead others to their destruction.\"<ref>[http://elgadir.com/eng/books/Kafi/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part2/part2-ch11.htm Prohibition on Speaking without Knowledge]</ref>}}\n\n===Ismaili Shi\u2019a===\nAmong the most notable [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] thinkers, Bu Ishaq Quhistani regarded the notion of subjective opinion ''(qiy\u0101s)'' as completely contradictory to the Islamic notion of ''[[Tawhid|tawh\u012bd]]'' (unity) as it ultimately gave rise to a countless divergent conclusions, besides which those who exercised deductive analogy  relied on little more than their imperfect individual intellects. According to Bu Ishaq, there must be a supreme intellect in every age, just as Muhammad was in his time. Without this, it would be impossible for any ordinary individual to attain knowledge of the Divine using mere speculation. The supreme intellect, he reasoned, could be none other than the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Imam]] of the age.<ref>[[Shafique Virani]]. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.149.</ref>\n\nBu Ishaq Quhistani referred to the Qur'anic tale of [[Adam and Eve#Islamic tradition|Adam and Eve]] to support his argument for the necessity of a perfect teacher who could provide spiritual edification (ta\u2019l\u012bm) in place of what he felt were subjective whims and wayward personal opinions (ra\u2019y). Commenting on the Qur'anic foundational narrative, Bu Ishaq explains that when God taught Adam the names of all things, Adam was commanded to teach the angels, as in sura 2 ([[Al-Baqara]]), ayah 33.<ref>{{Cite quran|2|33|s=ns}}</ref> Spiritual instruction therefore had its root in the Qur'an itself, however [[Satan]], in his arrogance, refused to bow down before Adam. Instead he protested, \"I am better than he. You created me from fire and him from clay.\" Thus the first to use deductive analogy was none other than Satan himself, by reasoning and challenging the command of God to prostrate. It was for this reason that Satan was punished for eternity and fell from favor until the final day.<ref>Virani, p.152.</ref> In Ismaili thought, therefore, the truth lay not in subjective opinion (ra\u2019y) and analogy (qiy\u0101s), but rather in the teaching of the bearer of truth (muhiqq), that is, the Imam of the time. The supreme teacher therefore exists at all times for the imperfect human intellects to submit (tasl\u012bm) to, as is proclaimed in the divine dictate:\n{{Quote|This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.|Sura 5 ([[Al-Ma'ida]]), ayah 3<ref>{{Cite quran|5|3|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\n==Mu'tazilite interpretations==\n{{POV section|date=September 2014}}\nPrimarily being a school of theology and not jurisprudence, the [[Mu'tazila]] generally did not hold independent positions on such issues. The majority of the Mu'tazila, despite being a distinct sect from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam, still preferred the juristic school of [[Abu Hanifa]], with a minority following [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s views. This resulted in the odd combination of being Mu'tazilite in creed but Sunni in jurisprudence, and consequently most of the Mu'tazila accepted analogical reason in addition to pure reason.<ref>Joseph A. Kechichian, [http://gulfnews.com/about-gulf-news/al-nisr-portfolio/weekend-review/a-mind-of-his-own-1.1121412 A mind of his own]. [[Gulf News]]: 21:30 December 20, 2012.</ref>\n\nMu'tazilite scholar [[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri]], a major contributor to early Muslim jurisprudence, said that in order for a jurist to perform analogical reason, they must possess a thorough knowledge of the rules and procedures for which allows the application of revealed law to an unprecedented case, in addition to basic knowledge of the Qur'an and prophetic tradition.\n\nNot all of the Mu'tazila followed Sunni jurisprudence.

[[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.</ref> Thus, while its status as a fourth source of law was accepted by the majority of later and modern Muslim jurists, this was not the case at the inception of Muslim jurisprudence as a field.\n\nOpposition to qiyas came from a number of angles. [[Professor]] Wal\u00eed b. Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem al-`Ujaj\u00ee [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] explains the opposition to qiyas as coming from multiple angles:<ref name=walid/>\n\n:Some of them argued that qiy\u00e2s is contrary to reason. One argument given in this light was that: \u201cDelving into this method is intellectually repugnant in its own right\u201d. Another argument was: \u201cIslamic legal rulings are based on human well-being, and no one knows human well-being except the One who gave us the sacred law. Therefore, the only way we can know the sacred law is from the revelation.\u201d Other scholars said that qiy\u00e2s is not contrary to reason, but prohibited by the sacred law itself.\n\n[https://menas.arizona.edu/user/scott-lucas Scott Lucas], when mentioning Ahmad Dallal\u2019s position on Salafism, states that Dallal:\n:...declared that Salafism \"is better understood as a method of thinking of, or an approach to, authoritative sources than as a distinct school of thought\" that includes the elevation of the Qur\u2019an and sound hadith at the expense of the opinions attributed to the eponyms of the four Sunni schools and the rejection (or sever curtailment) of qiyas<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B.

Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Their Relationship to Classical Salafi Islam|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2006|volume=13|issue=3|page=290}}</ref> Scott Lucas states that Bukhari\u2019s rejection of qiyas was placed within the context of what Bukhari perceived as invalid techniques of ijtihad, which included religious innovation (bid\u2019a), ra\u2019y, and tamthil. \n\nLucas also points out common mistakes other scholars make when analyzing Bukhari\u2019s position on qiyas. The biggest source of confusion for scholars is the fact that, while rejecting qiyas, Bukhari accepts the idea of tashbih (comparison), which seems similar to analogy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Their Relationship to Classical Salafi Islam|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2006|volume=13|issue=3|page=307\u2013309}}</ref> However, this is not the case, as tashbih is a comparison used in explanation (such as a metaphor), whereas qiyas applies a specific legal ruling to another case. \n\nBukhari is also known for his criticism of those who say that the Prophet used qiyas, and he devoted a section of his Sahih to the topic. Bukhari states:\n\n:If the Prophet was asked about something about which he had not received a revelation, he either said, \u2018I do not know\u2019 or did not reply until he received a revelation. he did not [reply] by means of ra\u2019y or qiyas, due to the [Qur\u2019anic] verse, \"\u2026in accordance to what God has shown you\" (4:105).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ibn Hajr|title=Fath al-bari|location=15:263}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott C.|title=The Legal Principles of Muhammad B.

With the Malikite and Hanbalite schools eventually granting full acceptance as the Hanafites and Shafi'ites already had done, the overwhelming majority of Sunni jurists from the late period onward affirmed its validity.<ref name=hisham/> [[Japan]]ese scholar of Islam [[Kojiro Nakamura]] defined the orthodox Sunni schools in regard to their eventual acceptance of analogy in descending order of that acceptance: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is, Hanbalis and Zahiris.<ref name=kojiro/> Much work was performed on the details of proper analogy, with major figures such as [[Al-Qastallani]], [[Al-Baqillani]], [[Al-Juwayni]] and [[Sayf al-Din al-Amidi|al-Amidi]] from the [[Shafi'i]]te school and [[Ibn Abidin]] from the [[Hanafi]]te school providing rules and guidelines still used to this day.\n\n===Application as a source of law===\nSunni scholar [[Baghawi]] gave a commonly accepted definition of analogy in Islamic law: analogical reasoning is the knowledge by which one learns the method of deriving a ruling from the Quran and prophetic tradition. In this case, the above-mentioned ruling should not already be apparent in the Quran, prophetic tradition or consensus. If there is no derivation involved due to the explicitness of the ruling in the Quran and prophetic tradition, then such a person is not, by definition, a mujtahid.\n\n==Shi\u2019a interpretations==\nNot unlike the Sunni [[Hanbali]]s and [[Zahiri]]s, the Shi\u2019a rejected both pure reason and analogical reason completely on account of the multitude of perspectives that would arise from it, viewing both methods as subjective.<ref name=mansoor/> There are various instances in which the Qur'an disapproves of a divergence of beliefs such as the following:\n{{Quote|And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:|Sura 8 ([[Al-Anfal]]), [[ayah]] 46}}<ref>{{Cite quran|8|46|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n===Twelver Shi\u2019a===\nWithin the [[Twelver]] Shi\u2019i legal tradition, the fourth source for deriving legal principles is not qiy\u0101s but rather the intellect ''\u2019\u2019[['Aql]]\u2019\u2019''. Twelver Shi\u2019a regard the ''[[ulama]]'' (scholars) as authorities in legal and religious matters during [[the Occultation]] (''ghayba'') of the [[Imamah (Shi'a Twelver doctrine)|Imamah]] [[Mahdi]]. Until the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|hidden Imam]], it is the responsibility of the ''ul\u0101ma\u2019'' to be his deputies and provide guidance on worldly matters. In modern interpretations of Twelver Shi\u2019ism, the most revered and learned scholars are styled as references for emulation ''([[Marja' (Islamic law)|marja taql\u012bd]]''). This system of deriving legal principles effectively replaces both the Sunni notion of consensus ''(ijm\u0101\u2019)'' and deductive analogy ''(qiy\u0101s)''<ref>Elhadj, Elie. The Islamic Shield: Arab Resistance to Democratic and Religious Reforms (Boca Raton: [[Brown Walker Press]]), 2007, p.48.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, in the chapter on Knowledge of the Twelver collection of prophetic traditions, [[Kitab al-Kafi]], one finds many traditions cited from the Imams that forbid the use of ''qiy\u0101s'', for example:\n{{Quote|The Imam (a.s.) said, \"My father narrated from my great-great-great-great grandfather, the holy Prophet (s.a.) who said, \u2018Those who act on the basis of analogy will face their destruction and lead others to their destruction. Those who give fatwas without the knowledge of the abrogating and the abrogated, the clear text and that which requires interpretation, they will face destruction and lead others to their destruction.\"<ref>[http://elgadir.com/eng/books/Kafi/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part2/part2-ch11.htm Prohibition on Speaking without Knowledge]</ref>}}\n\n===Ismaili Shi\u2019a===\nAmong the most notable [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] thinkers, Bu Ishaq Quhistani regarded the notion of subjective opinion ''(qiy\u0101s)'' as completely contradictory to the Islamic notion of ''[[Tawhid|tawh\u012bd]]'' (unity) as it ultimately gave rise to a countless divergent conclusions, besides which those who exercised deductive analogy  relied on little more than their imperfect individual intellects. According to Bu Ishaq, there must be a supreme intellect in every age, just as Muhammad was in his time. Without this, it would be impossible for any ordinary individual to attain knowledge of the Divine using mere speculation. The supreme intellect, he reasoned, could be none other than the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Imam]] of the age.<ref>[[Shafique Virani]]. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.149.</ref>\n\nBu Ishaq Quhistani referred to the Qur'anic tale of [[Adam and Eve#Islamic tradition|Adam and Eve]] to support his argument for the necessity of a perfect teacher who could provide spiritual edification (ta\u2019l\u012bm) in place of what he felt were subjective whims and wayward personal opinions (ra\u2019y). Commenting on the Qur'anic foundational narrative, Bu Ishaq explains that when God taught Adam the names of all things, Adam was commanded to teach the angels, as in sura 2 ([[Al-Baqara]]), ayah 33.<ref>{{Cite quran|2|33|s=ns}}</ref> Spiritual instruction therefore had its root in the Qur'an itself, however [[Satan]], in his arrogance, refused to bow down before Adam. Instead he protested, \"I am better than he. You created me from fire and him from clay.\" Thus the first to use deductive analogy was none other than Satan himself, by reasoning and challenging the command of God to prostrate. It was for this reason that Satan was punished for eternity and fell from favor until the final day.<ref>Virani, p.152.</ref> In Ismaili thought, therefore, the truth lay not in subjective opinion (ra\u2019y) and analogy (qiy\u0101s), but rather in the teaching of the bearer of truth (muhiqq), that is, the Imam of the time. The supreme teacher therefore exists at all times for the imperfect human intellects to submit (tasl\u012bm) to, as is proclaimed in the divine dictate:\n{{Quote|This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.|Sura 5 ([[Al-Ma'ida]]), ayah 3<ref>{{Cite quran|5|3|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\n==Mu'tazilite interpretations==\n{{POV section|date=September 2014}}\nPrimarily being a school of theology and not jurisprudence, the [[Mu'tazila]] generally did not hold independent positions on such issues. The majority of the Mu'tazila, despite being a distinct sect from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam, still preferred the juristic school of [[Abu Hanifa]], with a minority following [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s views. This resulted in the odd combination of being Mu'tazilite in creed but Sunni in jurisprudence, and consequently most of the Mu'tazila accepted analogical reason in addition to pure reason.<ref>Joseph A. Kechichian, [http://gulfnews.com/about-gulf-news/al-nisr-portfolio/weekend-review/a-mind-of-his-own-1.1121412 A mind of his own]. [[Gulf News]]: 21:30 December 20, 2012.</ref>\n\nMu'tazilite scholar [[Abu'l Husayn al-Basri]], a major contributor to early Muslim jurisprudence, said that in order for a jurist to perform analogical reason, they must possess a thorough knowledge of the rules and procedures for which allows the application of revealed law to an unprecedented case, in addition to basic knowledge of the Qur'an and prophetic tradition.\n\nNot all of the Mu'tazila followed Sunni jurisprudence. [[Al-Nazzam]] in particular denied the validity of analogical reason wholesale, preferring to rely on pure reason instead.\n\n== Qiyas and the Inquisition ([[Mihna]]) ==\nThe Inquisition that took place in the middle of the 9th century, which was initiated by the caliph al-Ma\u2019mun, ensured the persecution of many scholars who did not agree with the caliph\u2019s rationalistic views.
