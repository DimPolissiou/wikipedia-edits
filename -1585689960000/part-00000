Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of missions, overcoming obstacles and opponents, and for successful role-playing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained. When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character \"levels up\", achieving the next stage of character development. Such an event usually increases the character's statistics, such as maximum [[health (gaming)|health]], [[magic (gaming)|magic]] and strength, and may permit the character to acquire new abilities or improve existing ones. Leveling up may also give the character access to more challenging areas or items.\n\nIn some role-playing games, particularly those derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', experience points are used to improve characters in discrete [[#Level-based progression|experience levels]]; in other games, such as ''[[GURPS]]'' and the ''[[World of Darkness]]'' games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.\n\nIn most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases. As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases. Alternatively, games keep the amount of experience points per level constant, but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character's level increases.

To \"level\" or \"level up\" means to gain enough XP to reach the next level. By gaining a level, a character's abilities or stats will increase, making the character stronger and able to accomplish more difficult tasks, including safely battling stronger enemies, gaining access to more powerful abilities (such as spells or combat techniques), and to make, fix or disable more complex mechanical devices, or resolve increasingly difficult social challenges.\n\nTypically levels are associated with a [[character class]], and many systems allow combinations of classes, allowing a player to customize how their character develops.\n\nSome systems that use a level-based experience system also incorporate the ability to purchase specific traits with a set amount of experience; for example, ''D&D'' 3rd Edition bases the creation of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] items around a system of experience expenditure (known as ''burning xp'') and also uses a system of feat selection which closely matches the advantages of systems such as ''[[GURPS]]'' or the ''[[Hero System]]''. The [[d20 System]] also introduced the concept of [[prestige class]]es which bundle sets of mechanics, character development and requirements into a package which can be \"leveled\" like an ordinary class.\n\nSome games have a level cap, or a limit of levels available. For example, in the online game ''[[RuneScape]]'', no player can currently get higher than level 120 which needs a combined 104,273,167 experience points to gain, nor can any one skill gain more than 200 million experience.

It allows the player to select which skills to advance by allocating \"points\". Each character attribute is assigned a price to improve, so for example it might cost a character 2 points to raise an [[archery]] skill one notch, 10 points to raise overall [[dexterity]] by one, or it might cost 20 points to learn a new [[Spell (gaming)|magic spell]].\n\nPlayers are typically free to spend points however they choose, which greatly increases the control that a player has over the character's development, but also usually causes players to find that complexity increases as well. Some games therefore simplify character creation and advancement by suggesting ''packages'' or ''templates'' of pre-selected ability sets, so for example a player could have their character become an \"investigator\" by purchasing a package deal which includes many skills and abilities, rather than buying them each separately.\n\n===Cash-in advancement===\nA cash-in experience advancement system uses experience points to \"purchase\" such character advancements as class levels, skill points, new skills, feats or increasing saving throw bonuses or base attribute points each of which has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time usually once per game session. Once experience points are used thus they are \"spent\" and are erased from the character record or marked as spent and cannot be used again. ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' are examples of games that use a cash-in advancement system.\n\n===Hybrid systems===\nSome games use advancement systems which combine elements from two or more of the above types. For example, in the third edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', whenever a level is gained in a character class, it provides a number of skill points (the exact number is calculated based on the class and the character's intelligence statistic), which can be spent to raise various skills. Character level (generally the sum of a character's total levels in all classes) is used to calculate how high skills can be raised, when an ability score can be raised and when a character can gain new feats (a class of special abilities which include special attacks, proficiencies in various weapons and bonuses on the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of various actions) and how many experience points are needed to advance in level. In ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', experience points are divided into two categories: base experience and job experience. Gaining base experience increases a character's base level, which is used to calculate a character's maximum [[hit point|HP]] and [[magic point|SP]], increasing base level also provides points which can be spent to increase stats such as strength, agility and intelligence. Gaining job experience increases a character's job level, each job level provides a skill point which can be spent in the job's skill tree to gain a new ability, such as a spell, special attack or passive bonus, or improve an existing ability.\n\n==Video games==\nSince many early [[role-playing video game]]s are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Matt|title=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 1: The Early Years (1980-1983)|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132024/the_history_of_computer_.php|website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2007-10-30|language=en|date=2007-02-23}}</ref> most use a level-based experience system.\n\nIn many games, characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions, such as wielding a particular weapon, entering a restricted area, or earning the respect of a [[non-player character]]. Some games use a system of \"character levels\", where higher-level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level. In these games, statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum. Other games use a system of \"skill levels\" to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes, such as weapon handling, spell-casting proficiency, and stealthiness. These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent.\n\nSome games, particularly among [[MUD]]s and [[massively multi-player online role-playing game|MMORPG]]s, place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge, to reduce the effectiveness of [[Powerleveling|power-leveling]].\n\nRemorting is another technique that, while encouraging power-leveling, alleviates its ill effects by giving the player a sense of achievement as it maintains balance with other characters of lower level within the game.\n\n===Perks===\n{{see also|Skill tree|Power-up}}\n{{refimprove-section|date=November 2019}}\n\n\"Perks\" are special bonuses that [[video game]] players can add to their characters to give special abilities.  The term refers to the general usage of \"[[wiktionary:perk|perk]]\" as an abbreviation of \"[[wiktionary:perquisite|perquisite]]\". Perks are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points. The first video game to use the term \"perks\" to refer to such a mechanic was the 1997 role-playing video game ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]''.\n\nBesides RPGs, perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'' (2007),<ref name=\"Shamoon\">{{cite web|last1=Shamoon|first1=Evan|title=Call of Duty 4 Preview for 360 from 1UP.com|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=9 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623225728/http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|archivedate=23 June 2016|date=10 August 2007}}</ref> ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' (2009), and ''[[Killing Floor (2009 video game)|Killing Floor]]'' (2009), as well as [[action game]]s such as ''[[Metal Gear Online]]'' (2008).\n\n===Remorting===\n\"Remorting\" (also known as \"rebirth\", \"ascending/ascension\", \"reincarnating\", or \"[[new game plus]]\") is a game mechanic in some role-playing games whereby, once the player character reaches a specified level limit, the player can elect to start over with a new version of his or her character.  The bonuses that are given are dependent on several factors, which generally involve the stats of the character before the reincarnation occurs.  The remorting character generally loses all levels, but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable, usually access to different [[race (fantasy)|race]]s, [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s, [[character class|class]]es, skills, or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game.  A symbol often identifies a remorted character.\n\nThe term \"remort\" comes from [[MUD]]s,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Natalia|title=What is Remort?|url=http://tharsis-gate.org/articles/imaginary/WHATIS~1.HTM|website=Tharsis Gate|publisher=Imaginary Realities|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=May 1999}}</ref> in some of which players may become [[Immortal (MUD)|immortal]] characters\u2014administrative staff\u2014simply by advancing to the maximum level.

This is done, for example, by repeatedly participating in challenges, quests, tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive, often menial challenges. This definition can also be used in [[Computer games#Multiplayer|multi-player game]]s, but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning. A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is [[Optimization (role-playing games)|optimization]], also known as  \"XP farming\".\n\n==={{anchor|Power-Leveling}} Power-leveling===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nPower-leveling is using the help of another, stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone.\n\nOne kind of power-leveling refers to an experienced character [[Twinking#RPGs|assisting a character of much lower power]] (who is often controlled by the experienced character's controller as an assistant character or improved future main character in training) in defeating enemies that would normally be too powerful for the inexperienced character but are easily and quickly killed by the more powerful character or, in games in which experience points or \"credits\" are distributed in proportion to group members' levels, weakened almost to the point of death by the more powerful character, who is not grouped with the inexperienced character.  In the latter case, once an enemy is weakened to the point at which the lower-level character can safely finish the kill (usually with the more powerful character's use of healing spells/effects as a backup), the more powerful character uses a spell or effect to stop battle or, if the lower-level character's skills permit, allows itself to be \"rescued\" by the lower-level character, who then finishes the kill and gets all of the associated experience points. Defeating high-level enemies rewards the lower level character with more experience points than it could otherwise achieve.\n\nA second kind of power-leveling refers to a player paying a company or individual to play and level-up their character.  The customer provides the company with the username and password for their account, and the company assigns an employee to play the character for the customer until a desired level is reached.  This is against the [[Terms of Service|terms of service]] of many games and, if caught, may result in the character being banned. There are also risks involved, as an unscrupulous service may \"steal\" the character, for later resale to another customer.\n\nPower-leveling increased in ''[[EverQuest]]'' as it became more common to sell characters through the [[Internet]]. Techniques of [[kill stealing]] and [[Powergaming|power-gaming]] would make this pursuit considerably more attractive.\n\nTo combat power-leveling and leeching, some [[game designer]]s have devised better means of rewarding a player based on their actual contribution to the completion of the task. Another method used is to cap how much experience a character can gain at any single moment. For example, the game might not allow a character to gain more than 20% of the experience they need to level up by defeating an enemy. This is controversial in that it also punishes players who are skilled enough to face challenges more difficult than regular players or that band together with other players to face more difficult challenges.  \n\nAnother anti-power-leveling method, popularized through widespread adoption of the CircleMUD code base, is to distribute experience points from an enemy across a party ''[[pro rata]]'' by level, such that each party member gains a fraction of the enemy's experience points corresponding to the fraction of a party's total level ownership possessed by that character.  For example, after any given battle, a level-30 character in a party would earn twice as much experience as would a level-15 character.  Power-levelers sometimes circumvent this provision by what could be called \"passive power-leveling\", where a high level character who has access to healing abilities does not formally join the lower-level character's party, instead ''a'') healing and/or \"powering up\" the lower-level character, ''b'') targeting the enemy with spells or effects that do not involve joining the battle, and/or ''c'') fighting alongside the lower-level character until the enemy is nearly defeated and then pausing the battle (''e.g.'', through use of \"calm\" or a similar command) and allowing the lower-level character to resume, finish, and claim all the experience points for itself.  \n\nFinally, power-leveling may be rendered more difficult by having very large jumps between experience points required for each subsequent level of experience. It is common practice to have experience needed increasing in a non-linear way relative to experience levels to push players to the next town or land, but it can also reduce the opportunities for power-leveling as a player would be forced to find a different power-leveling technique for every couple of experience levels and move and do that technique.\n\n===Sharing===\nGames, that allow several characters participating in a single event (such as battle or quest completion), implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants. These methods include: only ''[[Last-hitting_(game_design)|last-hitting]]'' character, whose hit killed the enemy, getting experience (as in ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series); unconditionally sharing experience among characters (as in ''[[D&D|D&D system]]''); and giving experience based on each character's actions (as in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''). In some online games, it is possible to join a group and gain experience, loot or other rewards, while providing little or no contribution to the group. This type of behaviour is referred to as leeching, particularly when it is done without the permission of other group members. In games which allow players to gain rewards by [[kill stealing]], this is also considered a form of leeching. This is extremely common in games such as ''[[Dungeon Defenders]]'', in which all players receive the same rewards regardless of their contributions.\n\n===Botting===\n{{main|Video game bot}}\nSome players of online games use automated programs known as [[computer game bot|bots]] to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-has-a-botting-problem-1792727078|title=The Elder Scrolls Online Has A Botting Problem|first=Mike|last=Fahey|website=Kotaku.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref> This practice often violates the terms of service. Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character, either to increase the sale value of the account, or to allow the character to be used for commercial [[gold farming]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grinding (gaming)]]\n* [[Virtual economy]]\n* [[Virtual world]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Plainlist|\n{{Wiktionary-inline|experience points}}\n{{Wiktionary-inline|level up}}\n}}\n\n{{video game gameplay}}\n{{MUDs|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:MUD terminology]]\n[[Category:Player progress tracking in video games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Role-playing game unit for measuring a character's progress}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=May 2016}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=May 2016}}\n}}\nAn '''experience point''' (often abbreviated as '''exp''' or '''XP''') is a unit of measurement used in tabletop [[role-playing game]]s (RPGs) and [[role-playing video game]]s to quantify a [[player character]]'s life [[experience]] and progression through the game.

Some games therefore simplify character creation and advancement by suggesting ''packages'' or ''templates'' of pre-selected ability sets, so for example a player could have their character become an \"investigator\" by purchasing a package deal which includes many skills and abilities, rather than buying them each separately.\n\n===Cash-in advancement===\nA cash-in experience advancement system uses experience points to \"purchase\" such character advancements as class levels, skill points, new skills, feats or increasing saving throw bonuses or base attribute points each of which has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time usually once per game session. Once experience points are used thus they are \"spent\" and are erased from the character record or marked as spent and cannot be used again. ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' are examples of games that use a cash-in advancement system.\n\n===Hybrid systems===\nSome games use advancement systems which combine elements from two or more of the above types. For example, in the third edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', whenever a level is gained in a character class, it provides a number of skill points (the exact number is calculated based on the class and the character's intelligence statistic), which can be spent to raise various skills. Character level (generally the sum of a character's total levels in all classes) is used to calculate how high skills can be raised, when an ability score can be raised and when a character can gain new feats (a class of special abilities which include special attacks, proficiencies in various weapons and bonuses on the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of various actions) and how many experience points are needed to advance in level. In ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', experience points are divided into two categories: base experience and job experience. Gaining base experience increases a character's base level, which is used to calculate a character's maximum [[hit point|HP]] and [[magic point|SP]], increasing base level also provides points which can be spent to increase stats such as strength, agility and intelligence. Gaining job experience increases a character's job level, each job level provides a skill point which can be spent in the job's skill tree to gain a new ability, such as a spell, special attack or passive bonus, or improve an existing ability.\n\n==Video games==\nSince many early [[role-playing video game]]s are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Matt|title=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 1: The Early Years (1980-1983)|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132024/the_history_of_computer_.php|website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2007-10-30|language=en|date=2007-02-23}}</ref> most use a level-based experience system.\n\nIn many games, characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions, such as wielding a particular weapon, entering a restricted area, or earning the respect of a [[non-player character]]. Some games use a system of \"character levels\", where higher-level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level. In these games, statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum. Other games use a system of \"skill levels\" to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes, such as weapon handling, spell-casting proficiency, and stealthiness. These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent.\n\nSome games, particularly among [[MUD]]s and [[massively multi-player online role-playing game|MMORPG]]s, place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge, to reduce the effectiveness of [[Powerleveling|power-leveling]].\n\nRemorting is another technique that, while encouraging power-leveling, alleviates its ill effects by giving the player a sense of achievement as it maintains balance with other characters of lower level within the game.\n\n===Perks===\n{{see also|Skill tree|Power-up}}\n{{refimprove-section|date=November 2019}}\n\n\"Perks\" are special bonuses that [[video game]] players can add to their characters to give special abilities.  The term refers to the general usage of \"[[wiktionary:perk|perk]]\" as an abbreviation of \"[[wiktionary:perquisite|perquisite]]\". Perks are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points. The first video game to use the term \"perks\" to refer to such a mechanic was the 1997 role-playing video game ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]''.\n\nBesiddes RPGs, perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'' (2007),<ref name=\"Shamoon\">{{cite web|last1=Shamoon|first1=Evan|title=Call of Duty 4 Preview for 360 from 1UP.com|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=9 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623225728/http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|archivedate=23 June 2016|date=10 August 2007}}</ref> ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' (2009), and ''[[Killing Floor (2009 video game)|Killing Floor]]'' (2009), as well as [[action game]]s such as ''[[Metal Gear Online]]'' (2008).\n\n===Remorting===\n\"Remorting\" (also known as \"rebirth\", \"ascending/ascension\", \"reincarnating\", or \"[[new game plus]]\") is a game mechanic in some role-playing games whereby, once the player character reaches a specified level limit, the player can elect to start over with a new version of his or her character.  The bonuses that are given are dependent on several factors, which generally involve the stats of the character before the reincarnation occurs.  The remorting character generally loses all levels, but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable, usually access to different [[race (fantasy)|race]]s, [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s, [[character class|class]]es, skills, or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game.  A symbol often identifies a remorted character.\n\nThe term \"remort\" comes from [[MUD]]s,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Natalia|title=What is Remort?|url=http://tharsis-gate.org/articles/imaginary/WHATIS~1.HTM|website=Tharsis Gate|publisher=Imaginary Realities|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=May 1999}}</ref> in some of which players may become [[Immortal (MUD)|immortal]] characters\u2014administrative staff\u2014simply by advancing to the maximum level.

This is done, for example, by repeatedly participating in challenges, quests, tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive, often menial challenges. This definition can also be used in [[Computer games#Multiplayer|multi-player game]]s, but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning. A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is [[Optimization (role-playing games)|optimization]], also known as  \"XP farming\".\n\n==={{anchor|Power-Leveling}} Power-leveling===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nPower-leveling is using the help of another, stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone.\n\nOne kind of power-leveling refers to an experienced character [[Twinking#RPGs|assisting a character of much lower power]] (who is often controlled by the experienced character's controller as an assistant character or improved future main character in training) in defeating enemies that would normally be too powerful for the inexperienced character but are easily and quickly killed by the more powerful character or, in games in which experience points or \"credits\" are distributed in proportion to group members' levels, weakened almost to the point of death by the more powerful character, who is not grouped with the inexperienced character.  In the latter case, once an enemy is weakened to the point at which the lower-level character can safely finish the kill (usually with the more powerful character's use of healing spells/effects as a backup), the more powerful character uses a spell or effect to stop battle or, if the lower-level character's skills permit, allows itself to be \"rescued\" by the lower-level character, who then finishes the kill and gets all of the associated experience points. Defeating high-level enemies rewards the lower level character with more experience points than it could otherwise achieve.\n\nA second kind of power-leveling refers to a player paying a company or individual to play and level-up their character.  The customer provides the company with the username and password for their account, and the company assigns an employee to play the character for the customer until a desired level is reached.  This is against the [[Terms of Service|terms of service]] of many games and, if caught, may result in the character being banned. There are also risks involved, as an unscrupulous service may \"steal\" the character, for later resale to another customer.\n\nPower-leveling increased in ''[[EverQuest]]'' as it became more common to sell characters through the [[Internet]]. Techniques of [[kill stealing]] and [[Powergaming|power-gaming]] would make this pursuit considerably more attractive.\n\nTo combat power-leveling and leeching, some [[game designer]]s have devised better means of rewarding a player based on their actual contribution to the completion of the task. Another method used is to cap how much experience a character can gain at any single moment. For example, the game might not allow a character to gain more than 20% of the experience they need to level up by defeating an enemy. This is controversial in that it also punishes players who are skilled enough to face challenges more difficult than regular players or that band together with other players to face more difficult challenges.  \n\nAnother anti-power-leveling method, popularized through widespread adoption of the CircleMUD code base, is to distribute experience points from an enemy across a party ''[[pro rata]]'' by level, such that each party member gains a fraction of the enemy's experience points corresponding to the fraction of a party's total level ownership possessed by that character.  For example, after any given battle, a level-30 character in a party would earn twice as much experience as would a level-15 character.  Power-levelers sometimes circumvent this provision by what could be called \"passive power-leveling\", where a high level character who has access to healing abilities does not formally join the lower-level character's party, instead ''a'') healing and/or \"powering up\" the lower-level character, ''b'') targeting the enemy with spells or effects that do not involve joining the battle, and/or ''c'') fighting alongside the lower-level character until the enemy is nearly defeated and then pausing the battle (''e.g.'', through use of \"calm\" or a similar command) and allowing the lower-level character to resume, finish, and claim all the experience points for itself.  \n\nFinally, power-leveling may be rendered more difficult by having very large jumps between experience points required for each subsequent level of experience. It is common practice to have experience needed increasing in a non-linear way relative to experience levels to push players to the next town or land, but it can also reduce the opportunities for power-leveling as a player would be forced to find a different power-leveling technique for every couple of experience levels and move and do that technique.\n\n===Sharing===\nGames, that allow several characters participating in a single event (such as battle or quest completion), implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants. These methods include: only ''[[Last-hitting_(game_design)|last-hitting]]'' character, whose hit killed the enemy, getting experience (as in ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series); unconditionally sharing experience among characters (as in ''[[D&D|D&D system]]''); and giving experience based on each character's actions (as in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''). In some online games, it is possible to join a group and gain experience, loot or other rewards, while providing little or no contribution to the group. This type of behaviour is referred to as leeching, particularly when it is done without the permission of other group members. In games which allow players to gain rewards by [[kill stealing]], this is also considered a form of leeching. This is extremely common in games such as ''[[Dungeon Defenders]]'', in which all players receive the same rewards regardless of their contributions.\n\n===Botting===\n{{main|Video game bot}}\nSome players of online games use automated programs known as [[computer game bot|bots]] to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-has-a-botting-problem-1792727078|title=The Elder Scrolls Online Has A Botting Problem|first=Mike|last=Fahey|website=Kotaku.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref> This practice often violates the terms of service. Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character, either to increase the sale value of the account, or to allow the character to be used for commercial [[gold farming]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grinding (gaming)]]\n* [[Virtual economy]]\n* [[Virtual world]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Plainlist|\n{{Wiktionary-inline|experience points}}\n{{Wiktionary-inline|level up}}\n}}\n\n{{video game gameplay}}\n{{MUDs|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:MUD terminology]]\n[[Category:Player progress tracking in video games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Besiddes->Besides -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point"}

This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference.<ref name=\"Hoax\" /> On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to \"see the Lions washed\".<ref name=\"Hoax\" />\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian is known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

It is a day when many pranks are played: hoaxes \u2013 sometimes very sophisticated \u2013 are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1 can be untrue. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools\u2019 Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (''aprilsnar'' in Danish; ''aprillip\u00e4iv\u00e4'' in Finnish; ''aprilsk\u00e4mt'' in Swedish).

This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s. Many newspapers also spread a false story on April Fish Day, and a subtle reference to a fish is sometimes given as a clue to the fact that it is an April Fools' prank.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== First of April in Ukraine ===\nApril Fools' Day is widely celebrated in Odessa and has special local name [[Humorina]].

The festival includes a large parade in the city center, free concerts, street fairs and performances. Festival participants dress up in a variety of costumes and walk around the city fooling around and pranks with passersby.

In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"''Inocente palomita que te dejaste enga\u00f1ar''\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of ''palomita'', which means \u201cpopcorn\u201d in some dialects).\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is, \u201c''\u00a1Inocente para siempre!\u201d'' which means \"Innocent forever!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the prankster's says, \u201c''\u00a1Que la inocencia te valga!\u201d'' which roughly translates as advice to not be as gullible as the victim of the prank. In Spain, it is common to say just \u201c''\u00a1Inocente!\u201d'' (which in Spanish can mean \"innocent\u201d or \"gullible\").<ref name=Vilaweb>{{cite web| url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/670807/20030401/noticia.html| title=Avui \u00e9s el Dia d'Enganyar a Menorca|trans-title=Today is Fooling Day on Minorca| publisher=[[Vilaweb]]| date=April 1, 2003| language=Catalan| accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Colombia, the term  is used as \"P\u00e1sala por Inocentes\", which roughly means: \"Let it go; today it's Innocent's Day.\"\n\nIn Belgium, this day is also known as the \"Day of the innocent children\" or \"Day of the stupid children\". It used to be a day where parents, grandparents, and teachers would fool the children in some way. But the celebration of this day has died out in favor of April Fools' Day.\n\nNevertheless, on the Spanish island of [[Menorca]], ''Dia d'enganyar'' (\"Fooling day\") is celebrated on April 1 because Menorca was a British possession during part of the 18th century.

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Gilbert Hyatt patent.jpg|thumb|left|First page of Gilbert Hyatt's computer technology patent]]\nWhen Gilbert P.

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Gilbert Hyatt patent.jpg|thumb|left|First page of Gilbert Hyatt's computer technology patent]]\nWhen Gilbert P.

California's lawyers argued that in accordance with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], Nevada state courts could not hold California tax collectors liable because California law immunizes tax collectors from [[Legal liability|liability]].

He currently serves as a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]]. Weigel was the Founding President of the James Madison Foundation. He is the author of the best-selling biography of [[Pope John Paul II]], ''Witness to Hope'' and ''[[Tranquillitas Ordinis]]: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace''.\n\n==Career and personal life==\nWeigel was born and grew up in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where he attended [[St. Mary's Seminary and University]]. In 1975 he received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of St. Michael's College]] with a thesis entitled ''Karl Rahner's Theology of the Incarnation in Light of his Philosophy of Transcendental Anthropology''.  He has received 18 honorary doctorate degrees, as well as the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice|papal cross ''Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice'']] and the ''[[Gloria Artis]]'' Gold Medal from the Polish Ministry of Culture.\n\nWeigel lived in the Compton area, serving as Assistant Professor of Theology and Assistant Dean of Studies at the St. Thomas the Apostle Seminary School of Theology in [[Kenmore, Washington]], and Scholar-in-Residence at the World Without War Council of Greater Seattle, before returning to [[Washington, DC]], as a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]].\n\nWeigel served as the founding president of the James Madison Foundation (not to be confused with the [[James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation]]) from 1986 to 1989.<ref>[http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Weigel_George Weigel, George]. ''Right Web'', April 28, 2015.</ref> In 1994, he was a signer of the document [[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]].\n\nHe currently serves as Distinguished Senior Fellow and Chair of Catholic Studies at the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]] in Washington, DC.\n\nEach summer, Weigel and several other Catholic intellectuals from the United States, Poland, and across Europe conduct the Tertio Millennio Seminar on the Free Society in [[Krak\u00f3w]], in which they and an assortment of students from the United States, Poland, and several other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe discuss Christianity within the context of liberal democracy and capitalism, with the papal encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' being the focal point.\n\nWeigel and his spouse Joan live in north Bethesda, Maryland.

By George Weigel. [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]].</ref>\n\n<blockquote>From the [[Iliad]] to [[Tolstoy]] and beyond, that familiar trope, \"the fog of war,\" has been used to evoke the millennia\u2013old experience of the radical uncertainty of combat. Some analysts, however, take the trope of \"the fog of war\" a philosophical step further and suggest that warfare takes place beyond the reach of moral reason, in a realm of interest and necessity where moral argument is a pious diversion at best and, at worst, a lethal distraction from the deadly serious business at hand.<ref>George Weigel, ''Moral Clarity in a Time of War, First Things'', January 2003.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn some cases, he adds, moral reasoning may require that the United States support authoritarian regimes to fend off the greater evils of moral decay and threats to the security of the United States. For Weigel, America's shortcomings do not excuse her from pursuing the greater moral good.\n\nWeigel achieved much fame for writing ''Witness to Hope'', a biography of the late Pope John Paul II, which was also made into a documentary film.<ref>''Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II'', HarperCollins, 1999. {{ISBN|0-06-018793-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Weigel wrote an article in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine entitled \"The Cathedral and the Cube\" in which he used the contrast between the modernist ''[[La Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense|Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense]]'', and the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] cathedral, both located in [[Paris, France]], to illustrate what he called a loss of \"civilizational morale\" in [[Western Europe]], which he tied to the secular tyrannies of the 20th century, along with, more recently, plummeting birthrates and Europe's refusal to recognize the Christian roots of its culture. The article helped to popularize the word ''[[Christophobia]]'',<ref>[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-cathedral-and-the-cube-reflections-on-european-morale/ The Cathedral and the Cube: Reflections on European Morale.] To understand the continent's political incapacity, it helps to look beyond politics.

He has received 18 honorary doctorate degrees, as well as the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice|papal cross ''Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice'']] and the ''[[Gloria Artis]]'' Gold Medal from the Polish Ministry of Culture.\n\nWeigel lived in the Compton area, serving as Assistant Professor of Theology and Assistant Dean of Studies at the St. Thomas the Apostle Seminary School of Theology in [[Kenmore, Washington]], and Scholar-in-Residence at the World Without War Council of Greater Seattle, before returning to [[Washington, DC]], as a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]].\n\nWeigel served as the founding president of the James Madison Foundation (not to be confused with the [[James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation]]) from 1986 to 1989.<ref>[http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Weigel_George Weigel, George]. ''Right Web'', April 28, 2015.</ref> In 1994, he was a signer of the document [[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]].\n\nHe currently serves as Distinguished Senior Fellow and Chair of Catholic Studies at the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]] in Washington, DC.\n\nEach summer, Weigel and several other Catholic intellectuals from the United States, Poland, and across Europe conduct the Tertio Millennio Seminar on the Free Society in [[Krak\u00f3w]], in which they and an assortment of students from the United States, Poland, and several other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe discuss Christianity within the context of liberal democracy and capitalism, with the papal encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' being the focal point.\n\nWeigel and his spouse Joan live in north Bethseda, Maryland. They have three children.\n\nHe is a member of the advisory council of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php |title=National Advisory Council |publisher=[[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610171740/http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php |archivedate=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2011-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Weigel writes and serves on the board for the Institute for Religion and Public Life, which publishes ''[[First Things]]'', an ecumenical publication that focuses on encouraging a religiously informed public philosophy for the ordering of society.\n\n==Views==\nThe main body of Weigel's writings engage the issues of religion and culture.\n\nWeigel advocates a [[US foreign policy]] guided not by utopian notions about how nations should behave, but by moral reasoning.<ref>George Weigel, ''American Interests, American Purpose: Moral Reasoning and U.S. Foreign Policy'' (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1989).</ref><ref>[https://eppc.org/publications/america-and-the-world/ America and the World]. By George Weigel. [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]].</ref>\n\n<blockquote>From the [[Iliad]] to [[Tolstoy]] and beyond, that familiar trope, \"the fog of war,\" has been used to evoke the millennia\u2013old experience of the radical uncertainty of combat. Some analysts, however, take the trope of \"the fog of war\" a philosophical step further and suggest that warfare takes place beyond the reach of moral reason, in a realm of interest and necessity where moral argument is a pious diversion at best and, at worst, a lethal distraction from the deadly serious business at hand.<ref>George Weigel, ''Moral Clarity in a Time of War, First Things'', January 2003.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn some cases, he adds, moral reasoning may require that the United States support authoritarian regimes to fend off the greater evils of moral decay and threats to the security of the United States. For Weigel, America's shortcomings do not excuse her from pursuing the greater moral good.\n\nWeigel achieved much fame for writing ''Witness to Hope'', a biography of the late Pope John Paul II, which was also made into a documentary film.<ref>''Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II'', HarperCollins, 1999. {{ISBN|0-06-018793-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Weigel wrote an article in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine entitled \"The Cathedral and the Cube\" in which he used the contrast between the modernist ''[[La Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense|Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense]]'', and the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] cathedral, both located in [[Paris, France]], to illustrate what he called a loss of \"civilizational morale\" in [[Western Europe]], which he tied to the secular tyrannies of the 20th century, along with, more recently, plummeting birthrates and Europe's refusal to recognize the Christian roots of its culture. The article helped to popularize the word ''[[Christophobia]]'',<ref>[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-cathedral-and-the-cube-reflections-on-european-morale/ The Cathedral and the Cube: Reflections on European Morale.] To understand the continent's political incapacity, it helps to look beyond politics.

While ''Rock am Ring'' takes place at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] race track, ''Rock im Park'' takes place at the [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nBoth festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and another day in N\u00fcrnberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.<ref>Robertson, Joel (17 November 2014).

However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in [[Vienna]]. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused [[Munich-Riem airport]], and the following year to Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's [[Frankenstadion]] where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the [[2006 Football World Cup]]. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.\n\nThe 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rock Festival as Human Experiment (dead link as of 2011-11-25) | work=blog.sciam.com | url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713222937/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | archivedate=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 29 editions of Rock am Ring, the new owner of the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] decided that the contract would not be extended.

While ''Rock am Ring'' takes place at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] race track, ''Rock im Park'' takes place at the [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nBoth festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and another day in N\u00fcrnberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.<ref>Robertson, Joel (17 November 2014).

However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in [[Vienna]]. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused [[Munich-Riem airport]], and the following year to Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's [[Frankenstadion]] where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the [[2006 Football World Cup]]. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.\n\nThe 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rock Festival as Human Experiment (dead link as of 2011-11-25) | work=blog.sciam.com | url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713222937/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&ref=rss | archivedate=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 29 editions of Rock am Ring, the new owner of the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] decided that the contract would not be extended. The festival continued at another location in 2015 and 2016 ([[Mendig Air Base|Mendig Air Base/Vulkaneifel]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlk.com/news/2990 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 13,

The park is a triangle of 8 acres bounded by Union Street to the north, Richmond Terrace (A270) to the east and Ditchling Road ([[A23 road|A23]]) to the west. In the past, the land has been used as a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] for the [[Prince of Wales]] and as a setting for huge dinner parties to commemorate events such as the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nPresent day features of the Level include a grassed area with [[elm trees]] and outdoor seating, several caf\u00e9s, a [[skatepark]], a rose garden, a children's [[playground]] and a pond.

The northern part of the [[urban park]] is a grassed area. In the middle section is a [[skatepark]]. The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.

The [[Prince of Wales Ground]] hosted early [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches and served as the home of [[Brighton Cricket Club]], one of the principal founders of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] 50 years later.  In 1822 the cricket ground moved to a nearby site called the Hanover Ground; after another move to the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] on the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]], it was established on its present site on Eaton Road in Hove in 1872.<ref name=\"Seldon62\"/>  The Bat and Ball pub on Ditchling Road, facing the west side of The Level, commemorates the ground.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/>  Other popular events included the town's annual bonfire celebrations on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], regular circuses and fairs, and traditional activities such as [[bat and trap]]<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> and skipping.  Writing in 1883, a contributor to the ''[[Sussex Archaeological Society|Sussex Archaeological Collections]]'' journal noted that the local [[Good Friday]] tradition of skipping was still maintained at The Level, where \"scores of skippers\" could be seen.<ref name=\"Underwood24\">{{Harvnb|Underwood|1978|p=24.}}</ref>\n\nAs well as these informal recreational events, The Level (especially the southern part, closest to the town centre) was used for formal, town-wide events and commemorations, such as the Prince's birthday celebrations.<ref name=\"Fines25\"/>  The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Allied Powers']] defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was celebrated in Brighton by the Great Peace Festival of August 1814.

The shortest and most direct, covering {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} but requiring the most expensive construction work, would have terminated just north of The Level on the site of James Ireland's pleasure gardens.<ref name=\"OOB133\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=133.}}</ref>  After [[Brighton main line|a line]] was built slightly further west in 1841, Brighton's population grew rapidly and its character changed.<ref name=\"NEB268\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=268.}}</ref>  One feature of the mid- to late 19th century was a rapid growth in prostitution; it was common at The Level, when at night \"the scenes ... were said to beggar all description\".<ref name=\"OOB196\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=196.}}</ref>  A police station was established in a small building at the southern end of the park in 1865.

Among the regular events held there was the annual May Day rally and demonstration by the Brighton Trades Council, which was formed in 1890.  These events \"became well known nationally\"; members included [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was employed as a draper's assistant in Brighton at the time and who later became the first female [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Fines78\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=78.}}</ref>  Later, local resident [[Harry Cowley]] was an organiser of the barrow boys\u2014many of whom had been in the armed forces during World War I\u2014on nearby Oxford Street.

The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.
