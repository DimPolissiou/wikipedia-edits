Protected by [[Charlemagne]] from the supporters of his predecessor, [[Adrian I]], Leo subsequently strengthened Charlemagne's position by crowning him [[Carolingian Empire|emperor]]. The coronation not approved in Constantinople, although the Byzantines, occupied with their own defenses, were in no position to offer much opposition.\n\n==Rise==\nLeo was of a modest family in southern Italy, the son of Atyuppius and Elizabeth. He was made [[cardinal-priest]] of Santa Susanna by [[Pope Adrian I]], and seemingly also [[vestiarius]], or chief of the pontifical treasury, or wardrobe.<ref name=mann/><ref name=\"Miranda\">{{Cite web |url=https://webdept.fiu.edu/~mirandas/biosunknowndate772-795.htm |title=Leone (?-816) |last=Miranda |first=Salvador |website=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church \u2013 Biographical Dictionary |publisher=[[Florida International University]] |access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nHe was [[Papal selection before 1059|elected]] on 26 December 795, the day Adrian I was buried, and [[episcopal consecration|consecrated]] on the following day. It is quite possible that this haste may have been due to a desire on the part of the Romans to prevent any interference by the [[Franks]]. With the letter informing the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]] that he had been unanimously elected [[pope]], Leo sent him the keys of the confession of St. Peter, and the standard of the city, and requested an envoy. This he did to show that he regarded the Frankish king as the protector of the Holy See.<ref name=mann>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|prescript=|wstitle=Pope St. Leo III|first=Horace Kinder |last=Mann |volume=9}}</ref> In return, Charlemagne sent letters of congratulation and a great part of the treasure which the king had captured from the Avars.<ref name=shahan/>\n\n==Pontificate==\nCharlemagne's gift enabled Leo to be a great benefactor to the churches and charitable institutions of Rome. While Charlemagne's letter is respectful and even affectionate, it also exhibits his concept of the coordination of the spiritual and temporal powers, and he does not hesitate to remind the pope of his grave spiritual obligations.<ref name=shahan>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|prescript=|wstitle=Charlemagne|last=Shahan |first=Thomas |first2=Ewan |last2=Macpherson|volume=3}}</ref> Charlemagne's reply stated that it was his role to defend the Church, and the role of the pope to pray for the realm and for the victory of his army.\n\n===Attack on Leo===\nPrompted by jealousy or ambition, or the thought that only someone of the nobility should hold the office of pope, a number of relatives of Adrian I formed a plot to render Leo unfit to hold his office. On the occasion of the procession of the [[Greater Litanies]], 25 April 799, when the pope was making his way towards the [[Flaminian Gate]], he was suddenly attacked by armed men. He was dashed to the ground, and an effort was made to root out his tongue and tear out his eyes which left him injured and unconscious. He was rescued by two of Charlemagne's ''[[missi dominici]]'', who came with a considerable force.<ref name=mann/> Duke [[Winiges of Spoleto]] sheltered the fugitive pope, who went later to [[Paderborn]], where Charlemagne's camp then was.<ref name=shahan/> He was received by the Frankish king with the greatest honour at [[Paderborn]].<ref name=mann/> This meeting forms the basis of the epic poem ''[[Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa]]''.\n\nLeo was accused by his enemies of [[adultery]] and [[perjury]]. Charlemagne ordered them to [[Paderborn]], but no decision could be made. He then had Leo escorted back to Rome. In November 800, Charlemagne himself went to Rome, and on 1 December held a council there with representatives of both sides. Leo, on 23 December, took an [[oath of purgation]] concerning the charges brought against him, and his opponents were exiled.<ref name=mann/>\n\n===Coronation of Charlemagne===\nCharlemagne's father, [[Pepin the Short]], defended the papacy against the Lombards and issued the [[Donation of Pepin]], which granted the land around Rome to the pope as a fief. In 754 [[Pope Stephen II]] had conferred on Charles's father the dignity of ''Patricius Romanus'', which implied primarily the protection of the Roman Church in all its rights and privileges; above all in its temporal authority which it had gradually acquired (notably in the former Byzantine [[Duchy of Rome]] and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]) by just titles in the course of the two preceding centuries.<ref name=shahan/>\n\nTwo days after his oath, on Christmas Day 800, Leo [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] Charlemagne as [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]].
