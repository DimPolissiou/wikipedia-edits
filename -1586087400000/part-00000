Played by Laura Robinson, the eponymous Clare is a [[private investigator]] and part-owner of a [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] [[jazz club]], who uses intelligence rather than physical strength to solve cases. The supporting cast includes [[Robert Beltran]], [[Tony Plana]], [[Christina Pickles]], Robert Ruth, Robert Sutton, and Wayne Chou. [[Gil Mell\u00e9]] composed the show's soundtrack. The show was developed as one of three television programs ordered by Lifetime in 1991. It was one of the network's first scripted programs following its successful acquisition of ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'' from [[NBC]].\n\nAfter nine episodes had aired, the network placed the show on hiatus before it was eventually canceled. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. The episodes were rebroadcast as four [[television movie]]s in 1991 and 1992. Critical response to ''Veronica Clare'' was mixed, with [[Television criticism|commentators]] divided over its style. The series attracted feminist analysis, with a focus on Clare's identity as a female private investigator. Critics have compared Robinson to other actresses including [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and Clare to other fictional female detectives like [[V.I. Warshawski]].\n\n==Premise and characters==\nDescribed as a \"moody [[Film noir|noir]] [[Detective fiction|detective drama]]\" by the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'',<ref name=\"Source1\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-01/entertainment/9102030267_1_veronica-clare-lifetime-narrowcast|title=`Veronica Clare` Being Pulled From Lifetime|date=September 1, 1991|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200911/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-01/entertainment/9102030267_1_veronica-clare-lifetime-narrowcast|archivedate=October 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Veronica Clare'' revolves around the titular character (Laura Robinson) and her work as a [[private investigator]] and a partial owner of a [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] [[jazz club]].<ref name=\"Source3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1991/07/21/lifetime-premieres-three-original-series-tuesday/b320b374-21cd-4dfa-9750-11639daaa427/|title=Lifetime Premieres Three Original Series Tuesday|last=Brennan|first=Patricia|date=July 21, 1991|work=[[The Washington Post]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200911/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1991/07/21/lifetime-premieres-three-original-series-tuesday/b320b374-21cd-4dfa-9750-11639daaa427/?utm_term=.7c725e81e0b8|archivedate=October 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Source4\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19910721&id=I34iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DK8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1296,4084300&hl=en|title='Veronica Clare' premieres tonight on Lifetime|date=July 21, 1991|work=[[The Item]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}</ref> [[Mass communication]] professor Eileen R.

Hiltbrand likened Clare to [[Kathleen Turner]]'s leading role in the 1991 film [[V.I. Warshawski (film)|''V.I.

I. Warshawski.<ref name=\"Source6\" />\n\nCritics have analyzed Clare's identity as a female detective. Political theorist [[Philip Green (author)|Philip Green]] argued the show portrayed Clare as beautiful to accentuate her \"masculine toughness\" and avoid presenting her as a \"fetishized male in disguise\".<ref name=\"Book4\" /><ref name=\"Book5\">[[#Green1998|Green (1998)]]: p. 241</ref> Green wrote that Clare's appearance was kept separate from \"pure feminized sexuality\" and her skills differed from \"hypermasculine aggression\".

Played by Laura Robinson, the eponymous Clare is a [[private investigator]] and part-owner of a [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] [[jazz club]], who uses intelligence rather than physical strength to solve cases. The supporting cast includes [[Robert Beltran]], [[Tony Plana]], [[Christina Pickles]], Robert Ruth, Robert Sutton, and Wayne Chou. [[Gil Mell\u00e9]] composed the show's soundtrack. The show was developed as one of three television programs ordered by Lifetime in 1991. It was one of the network's first scripted programs following its successful acquisition of ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'' from [[NBC]].\n\nAfter nine episodes had aired, the network placed the show on hiatus before it was eventually canceled. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. The episodes were rebroadcast as four [[television movie]]s in 1991 and 1992. Critical response to ''Veronica Clare'' was mixed, with [[Television criticism|commentators]] divided over its style. The series attracted feminist analysis, with a focus on Clare's identity as a female private investigator. Critics have compared Robinson to other actresses including [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and Clare to other fictional female detectives like [[V.I. Warshawski]].\n\n==Premise and characters==\nDescribed as a \"moody [[Film noir|noir]] [[Detective fiction|detective drama]]\" by the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'',<ref name=\"Source1\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-01/entertainment/9102030267_1_veronica-clare-lifetime-narrowcast|title=`Veronica Clare` Being Pulled From Lifetime|date=September 1, 1991|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200911/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-01/entertainment/9102030267_1_veronica-clare-lifetime-narrowcast|archivedate=October 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Veronica Clare'' revolves around the titular character (Laura Robinson) and her work as a [[private investigator]] and a partial owner of a [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] [[jazz club]].<ref name=\"Source3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1991/07/21/lifetime-premieres-three-original-series-tuesday/b320b374-21cd-4dfa-9750-11639daaa427/|title=Lifetime Premieres Three Original Series Tuesday|last=Brennan|first=Patricia|date=July 21, 1991|work=[[The Washington Post]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200911/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1991/07/21/lifetime-premieres-three-original-series-tuesday/b320b374-21cd-4dfa-9750-11639daaa427/?utm_term=.7c725e81e0b8|archivedate=October 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Source4\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19910721&id=I34iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DK8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1296,4084300&hl=en|title='Veronica Clare' premieres tonight on Lifetime|date=July 21, 1991|work=[[The Item]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}</ref> [[Mass communication]] professor Eileen R.

Hiltbrand likened Clare to [[Kathleen Turner]]'s leading role in the 1991 film [[V.I. Warshawski (film)|''V.I.

I. Warshawski.<ref name=\"Source6\" />\n\nCritics have analyzed Clare's identity as a female detective. Political theorist [[Philip Green (author)|Philip Green]] argued the show portrayed Clare as beautiful to accentuate her \"masculine toughness\" and avoid presenting her as a \"fetishized male in disguise\".<ref name=\"Book4\" /><ref name=\"Book5\">[[#Green1998|Green (1998)]]: p. 241</ref> Green wrote that Clare's appearance was kept separate from \"pure feminized sexuality\" and her skills differed from \"hypermasculine aggression\". He interpreted Clare's role as the narrator as allowing her to never become the object of [[voyeurism]] or the [[male gaze]].<ref name=\"Book4\" /> [[Gender and women's studies]] scholar Susan White noted that ''Veronica Clare''<nowiki/>'s fashion and scenic design played a major role in its identity as a female-driven detective show.

The only \"Python\" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British subject in 1968 and formally [[Relinquishment of United States nationality|renounced his American citizenship]] in 2006.\n\nGilliam was born in [[Minnesota]], but spent his high school and college years in [[Los Angeles]]. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. He became a feature film director in the 1970s. Most of his films explore the theme of [[imagination]] and its importance to life, express his opposition to [[bureaucracy]] and [[authoritarianism]], and feature characters facing dark or paranoid situations. His own scripts feature [[black comedy]] and [[tragicomedy]] elements, combined with [[Plot twist#Surprise ending|surprise endings]].\n\nIn 1988, Gilliam and the other Monty Python members received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema.<ref>{{cite news |title=Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema in 1988 |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1988/film/outstanding-british-contribution-to-cinema |accessdate=25 August 2019 |agency=BAFTA.org}}</ref> In 2009, Gilliam received the [[BAFTA Fellowship]] for lifetime achievement.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7866717.stm |publisher= |work=BBC News| date=3 February 2009| accessdate=25 August 2019|title =Gilliam to get Bafta fellowship}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGilliam was born in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (n\u00e9e Vance) and James Hall Gilliam.

Gilliam attended [[Birmingham High School]], where he was the president of his class and senior prom king. He was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" and achieved straight A's.

It was '66\u2013'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.&nbsp;... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.&nbsp;... And I drove around this little English [[Hillman Minx]]\u2014top down\u2014and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, \"No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do.\" Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop.&nbsp;...\n\nAnd it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops.

One of his early [[Photonovel|photographic strips]] for ''[[Help!

Moving to England, he animated sequences for the children's series ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' which ran from 1967 to 1969, and which also featured [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], and [[Michael Palin]].<ref name=\"lambiek.net\"/>\n\n===Monty Python===\n[[File:Monty Python O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam (second from left) with the rest of [[Monty Python]] at [[The O2 Arena|the O<sub>2</sub> Arena]], London, in July 2014]]\nGilliam was a part of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' from its outset, credited at first as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits) and later as a full member.

The Gumbys were part of the Pythons' satire on 1970s television condescendingly encouraging more involvement from the \"man in the street\".]]\nIn 1978, Gilliam published ''Animations of Mortality'', an illustrated, tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to guide to his animation techniques and the visual language in them.<ref>[http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tgbooks.htm ''Dreams: Terry Gilliam Books'']. ''Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine''.</ref> Roughly 15 years later, between the release of the CD-ROM game ''[[Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time]]'' in 1994, which used many of Gilliam's animation templates, and the making of Gilliam's film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with Enteractive, a software company, to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as license-free [[clip art]]s for people to create their own [[flash animation]]s, but the project hovered in limbo for years,<ref>Cate, Hans ten (1996) [http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1996/llama020.html ''\"Animations of Mortality:\" Terry Gilliam's New Interactive CD-ROM Game''].

Around the time of Gilliam's film ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a license-free download of [[Adobe After Effects]] or similar files.\n\nBesides creating the animations, Gilliam also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did, however, have some notable sketch roles, such as Cardinal Fang of the [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition]]; the bespectacled commenter who said, \"I can't add anything to that!\" in the sketch \"[[Election Night Special]]\"; Kevin Garibaldi, the brat on the couch shouting \"I want more beans!\" in the sketch \"Most Awful Family in Britain 1974\" (episode 45); the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask in \u201cThe Visitors\u201d; and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in \u201cAnt Poetry Reading\u201d. More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of makeup or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who ended sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken. He took a number of  roles in the films, including both [[Patsy (Monty Python)|Patsy]] and The Old Man From Scene 24 in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (which he co-directed with [[Terry Jones]]; Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones guided the actors' performances) and the jailer in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''. He also designed the covers of most of the Monty Python albums, including ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'', ''[[The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief]]'', ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'', and all of their film soundtrack albums.<ref>''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]'', episode 3, 2009</ref> Katy Hepburn, a freelance designer and graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in London, also worked with Gilliam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Communicate: Independent British Graphic Design Since the Sixties |date=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Directing===\nWith the gradual breakup of the Python troupe between ''Life of Brian'' in 1979 and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''. He says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with ''Time Bandits'': the \"Trilogy of Imagination\" (written by Gilliam) about \"the ages of man\" in ''Time Bandits'' (1981), ''Brazil'' (1985), and ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (1988). All are about the \"craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.\"<ref name=\"essay\">Matthews, Jack (1996). ''Dreaming Brazil''. Essay accompanying the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]] DVD.</ref> All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; ''Time Bandits'' through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'' through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and ''Munchausen'', through the eyes of an elderly man.\n\nIn the 1990s, Gilliam directed a trilogy of Americana: ''The Fisher King'' (1991), ''12 Monkeys'' (1995), and ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (1998), which played on North American soil and, while still surreal, had fewer fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.<ref>Pirie, Chris (2002).

I love the term [[magic realism]], whoever invented it&nbsp;\u2013 I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.<ref name=\"rushdie\" />}}\n\nAs for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show ''First Hand'' on RoundhouseTV, \"There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to ''know'' things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can ''fly...!''\"<ref>{{YouTube|1v7YjOCC-cM|Terry Gilliam}}. Uploaded by RoundhouseTV.</ref>\n\nGilliam's films are usually imaginative [[fantasy|fantasies]]. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, \"the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on&nbsp;... that's very much a Terry theme.\"<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2008). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/parncmck.htm \"Charles McKeown on writing the ''Dr Parnassus'' script\"]. ''Dreams''.</ref> Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of [[Personal identity|identity]] and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes \"higher\" and \"lower\" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made [[Cult image|idol]], or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, [[paranoia|paranoid]] atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature [[black comedy]] and often end with a dark [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] twist.\n\nGilliam is fascinated with the [[Baroque]] period because of the pronounced struggle between spirituality and rationality in that era.<ref>\"The clash between the baroque and the Newtonian view of the world is my message in a bottle.\" [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/bmfact.htm \"Dreams: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\"].</ref><ref name=\"hamel\">\"In [Max] Weber's view, the technological world of modernity tries to eliminate any need for magic, fantasy, or any irrational forces. Gilliam presents this idea of change 'from without' through certain aspects of his mise-en-scene.\" Hamel, Keith James. [http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/brazil.htm \"Modernity and Mise-en-Scene: Terry Gilliam and ''Brazil''\"]. ''Images: Journal of Film and Popular Culture'', issue 6.</ref> There is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticism about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with [[Fresnel lens|low-tech magnifying lenses]] in ''Brazil'' and a red [[knight]] covered with flapping bits of cloth in ''The Fisher King''. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]] society, the film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of the economic historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] and the sociologist [[Max Weber]], specifically the latter's concept of the \"[[iron cage]]\" of rationality.<ref name=\"hamel\" />\n\n===Look and style===\n[[File:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg|thumb|upright|Gilliam at Cannes, 2001]]\nGilliam's films have a distinctive look, not only in ''[[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]'' but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly [[low-angle shot]]s, [[high-angle shot]]s, and [[Dutch angle]]s. [[Roger Ebert]] said that \"his world is always [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] in its richness of detail\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050825/REVIEWS/50822002/1023 |title=The Brothers Grimm Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=1 June 2011 |first=Chaz's |last=Blog}}</ref> Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] [[ultra wide angle lens|ultra-wide-angle lenses]] with [[focal length]]s of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] and extremely [[deep focus]]. Gilliam's long-time director of photography [[Nicola Pecorini]] has said, \"with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm.\"<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2011). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/wholnico.htm \"Dreams: Nicola Pecorini on ''The Wholly Family''\"]. ''Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine''.</ref> This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65&nbsp;mm is the focal length of a [[normal lens]], resembling the natural human [[field of view]], unlike Gilliam's signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14&nbsp;mm lens has become informally known as \"The Gilliam\" among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since ''Brazil''.<ref>Stubbs, Phil: [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tidegill.htm \"Terry Gilliam Talks ''Tideland''\". ''Dreams''.]</ref> Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:\n\n{{quote|The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like I'm in the space of the film, I'm surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and that's what I like about it. It's actually harder to do, it's harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that I'm not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important.

After the lengthy quarrelling with [[Universal Studios]] over ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam's next picture, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', cost around US$46&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=adventuresofbaronmunchausen.htm |title=Box Office Mojo |website=Box Office Mojo |date=20 June 1989 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> and then earned only about US$8&nbsp;million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from [[Columbia Pictures]], which was in the process of being sold at the time.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gilliam and [[Charles McKeown]] developed a script for ''Time Bandits 2'', a project that was never produced because several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and the choice of a lead actor.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berra\n|first=John\n|title=Declarations of Independence: American Cinema and the Partiality of Independent Production\n|url=https://archive.org/details/declarationsofin0000berr\n|url-access=registration\n|accessdate=7 October 2010\n|year=2008\n|publisher=Intellect Books\n|isbn=978-1-84150-185-7\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/declarationsofin0000berr/page/60 60]\u20131}}</ref>\n\nGilliam attempted twice to adapt [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' comics into a film, in 1989 and 1996. Both attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1999, Gilliam attempted to film ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'', budgeted at US$32.1&nbsp;million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing [[Don Quixote]] ([[Jean Rochefort]]) suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]], and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Ebert\n|first=Roger\n|authorlink=Roger Ebert\n|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2006\n|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780740755385\n|url-access=registration\n|accessdate=7 October 2010\n|date=November 2005\n|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing\n|isbn=978-0-7407-5538-5\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780740755385/page/400 400]\u20131}}</ref> Despite the cancellation, the aborted project did yield the documentary ''[[Lost in La Mancha]]'', produced from film from a second crew that had been hired by Gilliam to document the making of ''Quixote''.

''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'', despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105&nbsp;million worldwide.

Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliam's non-Python films has featured at least one of his fellow Monty Python alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors at least twice (in order of first film appearance):\n* [[Derrick O'Connor]] (''Jabberwocky'', ''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'')\n* [[Derek Deadman]] (''Jabberwocky'', ''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'')\n* [[Charles McKeown]] (''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'', ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'')\n* [[Katherine Helmond]] (''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'', ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'')\n* [[Ray Cooper]] (''Brazil'', ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', ''The Zero Theorem'')\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] (''Brazil'', ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', ''The Brothers Grimm'', ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote'')\n* Stephen Bridgewater (''The Fisher King'', ''12 Monkeys'', ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'')\n* [[Peter Stormare]] (''The Brothers Grimm'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', ''The Zero Theorem'')\n\nOther recurring collaborators include Gilliam's cinematographers [[Roger Pratt (cinematographer)|Roger Pratt]] (''Brazil'', ''The Fisher King'', ''12 Monkeys'') and [[Nicola Pecorini]] (''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', ''The Brothers Grimm'', ''Tideland'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', ''The Zero Theorem'', ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote''), and his co-writer McKeown (''Brazil'', ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'').\n\n===Gilliam and ''Harry Potter''===\n[[J.

The only \"Python\" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British subject in 1968 and formally [[Relinquishment of United States nationality|renounced his American citizenship]] in 2006.\n\nGilliam was born in [[Minnesota]], but spent his high school and college years in [[Los Angeles]]. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. He became a feature film director in the 1970s. Most of his films explore the theme of [[imagination]] and its importance to life, express his opposition to [[bureaucracy]] and [[authoritarianism]], and feature characters facing dark or paranoid situations. His own scripts feature [[black comedy]] and [[tragicomedy]] elements, combined with [[Plot twist#Surprise ending|surprise endings]].\n\nIn 1988, Gilliam and the other Monty Python members received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema.<ref>{{cite news |title=Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema in 1988 |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1988/film/outstanding-british-contribution-to-cinema |accessdate=25 August 2019 |agency=BAFTA.org}}</ref> In 2009, Gilliam received the [[BAFTA Fellowship]] for lifetime achievement.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7866717.stm |publisher= |work=BBC News| date=3 February 2009| accessdate=25 August 2019|title =Gilliam to get Bafta fellowship}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGilliam was born in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (n\u00e9e Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for [[Folgers]] before becoming a carpenter.

Gilliam attended [[Birmingham High School]], where he was the president of his class and senior prom king. He was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" and achieved straight A's. During high school, he began to avidly read ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, then edited by [[Harvey Kurtzman]], which would later influence Gilliam's work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gilliam|first1=Terry|last2=Sterritt|first2=David| authorlink2=David Sterritt|last3=Rhodes|first3=Lucille|title=Terry Gilliam: Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eDE0hce0kEC&pg=PA65|accessdate=7 October 2010|date=April 2004|publisher=Univ.

It was '66\u2013'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.&nbsp;... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.&nbsp;... And I drove around this little English [[Hillman Minx]]\u2014top down\u2014and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, \"No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do.\" Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop.&nbsp;...\n\nAnd it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here\u2014I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.<ref name=\"rushdie\">[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam \"Salman Rushdie Talks with Terry Gilliam\"].

Around the time of Gilliam's film ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a license-free download of [[Adobe After Effects]] or similar files.\n\nBesides creating the animations, Gilliam also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did, however, have some notable sketch roles, such as Cardinal Fang of the [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition]]; the bespectacled commenter who said, \"I can't add anything to that!\" in the sketch \"[[Election Night Special]]\"; Kevin Garibaldi, the brat on the couch shouting \"I want more beans!\" in the sketch \"Most Awful Family in Britain 1974\" (episode 45); the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask in \u201cThe Visitors\u201d; and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in \u201cAnt Poetry Reading\u201d. More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of makeup or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who ended sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken. He took a number of  roles in the films, including both [[Patsy (Monty Python)|Patsy]] and The Old Man From Scene 24 in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (which he co-directed with [[Terry Jones]]; Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones guided the actors' performances) and the jailer in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''. He also designed the covers of most of the Monty Python albums, including ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'', ''[[The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief]]'', ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'', and all of their film soundtrack albums.<ref>''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]'', episode 3, 2009</ref> Katy Hepburn, a freelance designer and graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in London, also worked with Gilliam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Communicate: Independent British Graphic Design Since the Sixties |date=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Directing===\nWith the gradual breakup of the Python troupe between ''Life of Brian'' in 1979 and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''. He says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with ''Time Bandits'': the \"Trilogy of Imagination\" (written by Gilliam) about \"the ages of man\" in ''Time Bandits'' (1981), ''Brazil'' (1985), and ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (1988). All are about the \"craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.\"<ref name=\"essay\">Matthews, Jack (1996). ''Dreaming Brazil''. Essay accompanying the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]] DVD.</ref> All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; ''Time Bandits'' through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'' through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and ''Munchausen'', through the eyes of an elderly man.\n\nIn the 1990s, Gilliam directed a trilogy of Americana: ''The Fisher King'' (1991), ''12 Monkeys'' (1995), and ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (1998), which played on North American soil and, while still surreal, had fewer fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.<ref>Pirie, Chris (2002).

The world is a million possible things.<ref name=\"rushdie\" />}}\n\nAs for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show ''First Hand'' on RoundhouseTV, \"There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to ''know'' things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can ''fly...!''\"<ref>{{YouTube|1v7YjOCC-cM|Terry Gilliam}}. Uploaded by RoundhouseTV.</ref>\n\nGilliam's films are usually imaginative [[fantasy|fantasies]]. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, \"the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on&nbsp;... that's very much a Terry theme.\"<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2008). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/parncmck.htm \"Charles McKeown on writing the ''Dr Parnassus'' script\"]. ''Dreams''.</ref> Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of [[Personal identity|identity]] and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes \"higher\" and \"lower\" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made [[Cult image|idol]], or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, [[paranoia|paranoid]] atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature [[black comedy]] and often end with a dark [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] twist.\n\nGilliam is fascinated with the [[Baroque]] period because of the pronounced struggle between spirituality and rationality in that era.<ref>\"The clash between the baroque and the Newtonian view of the world is my message in a bottle.\" [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/bmfact.htm \"Dreams: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\"].</ref><ref name=\"hamel\">\"In [Max] Weber's view, the technological world of modernity tries to eliminate any need for magic, fantasy, or any irrational forces.

[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/brazil.htm \"Modernity and Mise-en-Scene: Terry Gilliam and ''Brazil''\"]. ''Images: Journal of Film and Popular Culture'', issue 6.</ref> There is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticism about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with [[Fresnel lens|low-tech magnifying lenses]] in ''Brazil'' and a red [[knight]] covered with flapping bits of cloth in ''The Fisher King''. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]] society, the film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of the economic historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] and the sociologist [[Max Weber]], specifically the latter's concept of the \"[[iron cage]]\" of rationality.<ref name=\"hamel\" />\n\n===Look and style===\n[[File:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg|thumb|upright|Gilliam at Cannes, 2001]]\nGilliam's films have a distinctive look, not only in ''[[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]'' but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly [[low-angle shot]]s, [[high-angle shot]]s, and [[Dutch angle]]s. [[Roger Ebert]] said that \"his world is always [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] in its richness of detail\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050825/REVIEWS/50822002/1023 |title=The Brothers Grimm Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=1 June 2011 |first=Chaz's |last=Blog}}</ref> Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] [[ultra wide angle lens|ultra-wide-angle lenses]] with [[focal length]]s of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] and extremely [[deep focus]].

''Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine''.</ref> This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65&nbsp;mm is the focal length of a [[normal lens]], resembling the natural human [[field of view]], unlike Gilliam's signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14&nbsp;mm lens has become informally known as \"The Gilliam\" among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since ''Brazil''.<ref>Stubbs, Phil: [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tidegill.htm \"Terry Gilliam Talks ''Tideland''\". ''Dreams''.]</ref> Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:\n\n{{quote|The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like I'm in the space of the film, I'm surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and that's what I like about it. It's actually harder to do, it's harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that I'm not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. It's there, but there's other things to occupy, and some people don't like that because I'm not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lens where I'd focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus.&nbsp;...<br>\n[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds we're creating.&nbsp;...

After the lengthy quarrelling with [[Universal Studios]] over ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam's next picture, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', cost around US$46&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=adventuresofbaronmunchausen.htm |title=Box Office Mojo |website=Box Office Mojo |date=20 June 1989 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> and then earned only about US$8&nbsp;million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from [[Columbia Pictures]], which was in the process of being sold at the time.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gilliam and [[Charles McKeown]] developed a script for ''Time Bandits 2'', a project that was never produced because several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and the choice of a lead actor.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berra\n|first=John\n|title=Declarations of Independence: American Cinema and the Partiality of Independent Production\n|url=https://archive.org/details/declarationsofin0000berr\n|url-access=registration\n|accessdate=7 October 2010\n|year=2008\n|publisher=Intellect Books\n|isbn=978-1-84150-185-7\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/declarationsofin0000berr/page/60 60]\u20131}}</ref>\n\nGilliam attempted twice to adapt [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' comics into a film, in 1989 and 1996.

It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama|Best Drama Series]] in 2013.

Because, mostly, it is, and because to the extent it tells the story of two real people, it also adorns the telling with dramatic practicalities, invented characters and narrative detours. Indeed, it's down these side streets, casting a brief light on a passing character (patients, prostitutes, a provost's wife), that the show finds many of its best moments.\"<ref name=\"lat2013\"/>\n\nOther than principal characters, which are partly fictionalized, adults are significantly fictionalized; however, children are entirely fictionalized. In real life, Masters and Johnson each have two children, however, in the series they have three children each. Episodes featuring the children include a disclaimer where it states that their storylines are \"entirely fictitious\". Series creator Michelle Ashford explained, \"We are telling a non-fiction story and one where there are people who are still alive out there, and those people need to be protected. We were advised to add [the baby] to protect the people that are still alive. It wasn't a storytelling prerogative. It had to do with protecting living people.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/masters-of-sex-fake-baby/ |title=The Kids Aren't Alright: Behind Masters of Sex's Controversial Children's Stories |website=TV Guide |first=Hanh |last=Nguyen |date=August 11, 2015 |accessdate=January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Cast of Masters of Sex at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|The cast and crew at [[PaleyFest]] 2014.

Because, mostly, it is, and because to the extent it tells the story of two real people, it also adorns the telling with dramatic practicalities, invented characters and narrative detours. Indeed, it's down these side streets, casting a brief light on a passing character (patients, prostitutes, a provost's wife), that the show finds many of its best moments.\"<ref name=\"lat2013\"/>\n\nOther than principal characters, which are partly fictionalized, adults are significantly fictionalized; however, children are entirely fictionalized. In real life, Masters and Johnson each have two children, however, in the series they have three children each. Episodes featuring the children include a disclaimer where it states that their storylines are \"entirely fictitious\". Series creator Michelle Ashford explained, \"We are telling a non-fiction story and one where there are people who are still alive out there, and those people need to be protected. We were advised to add [the baby] to protect the people that are still alive. It wasn't a storytelling prerogative.

{"title_page": "Thomas Mortimer", "text_new": "{{for|the English writer|Thomas Mortimer (writer)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n'''Sir Thomas Mortimer''' (c. 1350\u20131399) was a medieval English soldier and statesman who served briefly in several important administrative and judicial state offices in [[Ireland]] and played a part in the opposition to the government of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. He was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] member of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], who  were one of the leading noble houses in England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer  lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Roger, earl of March]]. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the [[Lords Appellant]] who opposed the administration  of King Richard II.\n\nSir Thomas took part in the appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act ultimately led to his conviction for [[treason]]. He fled for his life and died in [[exile]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Conte de la Marsche.jpg|thumb|150px|Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March]]\n\nThomas was an illegitimate son of [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]] (1328\u20131360).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=56}} He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of  around 1350.{{sfn|Isaacson|1913|p=54}} He seems to have been treated by his father and  his brother very much as one of the family. Nothing is known of his mother. By 1380 he had acquired considerable military expertise, and had been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]].

He was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] member of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], who  were one of the leading noble houses in England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer  lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Roger, earl of March]]. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the [[Lords Appellant]] who opposed the administration  of King Richard II.\n\nSir Thomas took part in the appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act ultimately led to his conviction for [[treason]]. He fled for his life and died in [[exile]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Conte de la Marsche.jpg|thumb|150px|Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March]]\n\nThomas was an illegitimate son of [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]] (1328\u20131360).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=56}} He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of  around 1350.{{sfn|Isaacson|1913|p=54}} He seems to have been treated by his father and  his brother very much as one of the family.
