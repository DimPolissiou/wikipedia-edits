Binns was a prolific author, publishing many novels of adventure and mystery, from 1917 to 1939. His publisher in Britain was [[Ward Lock]]. Though he died in 1935, Ward Lock continued to publish novels under his name until 1939.  His novel ''A Mating in the Wild'' was published in the U.S. in 1920 by Alfred A. Knopf and the [[A. L. Burt]] Company.\n\nBinns also published novels with Ward Lock under the [[pseudonym]] of '''Ben Bolt'''; these were similar in subject matter and treatment to the novels published under his own name.  His stories were set in many locations, including [[Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Canada]], particularly the [[Yukon]].

Shortly after, several other missionaries were also called, including [[Orson Hyde]], [[Willard Richards]], and [[Joseph Fielding]]. They left [[Kirtland, Ohio]] on 13 June 1837. Three other missionaries, John Goodson, Isaac Russell, and John Snyder, were also called to go to England.

Although Graham and other anti-Mormons continued to denounce the church, the government told them that there was no evidence that missionaries were acting in a way to justify deportation.{{r|thorp1979}}\n\nIn 1937, leaders in the United Kingdom celebrated the church's centennial in the British Isles. During the first 100 years, 126,593 people had been baptised, and 52,000 of these had immigrated to the USA.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] all the church's American missionaries were again evacuated. This was completed by early 1940 when [[Hugh B. Brown]], then serving as president of the British Mission, returned to the USA. In his place a local Latter-day Saint, Andre K. Anastasiou, was appointed. Brown returned to the UK on 29 March 1944 and again began serving as the mission president..

Michael Quinn]], in the late 1950s through to the early 1960s a new focus on growth in convert numbers led to the introduction of \"Youth Baptism Program\", which became colloquially known as the \"Baseball Baptism Program\". This used baseball and other team sports as a way to bring young teenage boys into the LDS Church. Introduced by mission president T. Bowring Woodbury, who led the British mission from October 1958 to January 1962, it dramatically increased the baptism rate for new converts (in 1962 there were 12,000 converts alone) but controversy over the focus on numbers, the pressure on missionaries from the British Mission headquarters and the use of deception to get boys to agree to baptism led to the program being ended by 1965, and excommunications (which was the process of cancelling membership at that time) of most of the [[Less-active Mormon|inactive]] new converts followed.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Quinn |first= D.

Prior to the administration of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] David O. McKay, most British congregations met in rented rooms and buildings.

However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand.  Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.<ref name=Continue/>\n\nHarris ran a \"Notice to Voters\" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was \"due to errors by her campaign.\"<ref name=Notice>{{cite news|author=Kamala Harris|title=Notice to Voters|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 20, 2003}}</ref>  Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for [[Begging|panhandling]] without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, [[Gavin Newsom]], whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on [[domestic violence]].<ref name=Respect>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Domestic violence victim says DA Hallinan showed respect|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 8, 2003}}</ref>  Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case.

During Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance.

Hallinan's office provided Piscitelli with access to files it had obtained in 2002 after Hallinan directed investigators to try to build a case against the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|archdiocese]] and forced the archdiocese to turn over 75 years of its own records.<ref name=Cooperating/> The files implicated high-level church officials and detailed how they internally handled [[pedophile]] priests.<ref name=Coddles>{{cite news|author=Try Bundy|title=Kamala Harris Takes A Stand on Internet Pedophiles, Coddles Pedophile Catholic Priests|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=3 Jun 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy/>  The files had been successfully used to indict a priest, Father Austin Peter Keegan.<ref name=Cooperating/>\n\nPiscitelli intended to use the files in a similar manner, seeking any information that could be helpful in his civil suit against the church that oversaw his high school.

In response, Piscitelli and his family and friends began mounting posters across the city to force Harris to respond. He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under [[California Public Records Act|California's Public Records Act]], but Harris's deputy, Paul Henderson, denied the request, stating that Harris's investigative files \"were not subject to California's government transparency laws.\"<ref name=Secrecy/> In 2005, when [[San Francisco Weekly]] writer Ron Russell attempted the request again, a Harris spokesperson told him:\n\n{{quote|\"If we did it [granted access to files] for you, we would have to do it for everybody.
