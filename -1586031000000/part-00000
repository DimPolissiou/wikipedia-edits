{"title_page": "Biblical poetry", "text_new": "{{Tone|date=December 2009}}\nThe ancient [[Hebrews]] identified [[poetry|poetical]] portions in their [[sacred texts]], as shown by their entitling as \"[[song]]s\" or as \"[[chant]]s\" passages such as [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 15:1-19 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:17-20; a song or chant ({{transl|hbo|shir}}) is, according to the primary meaning of the term, [[poetry]]. The question as to whether the poetical passages of the Old Testament show signs of regular rhythm or meter remains unsolved.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10738-meter-in-the-bible\n | title= METER IN THE BIBLE | publisher= JewishEncyclopedia.com\n | accessdate= December 7, 2011 | author= Joseph Jacobs, W. H. Cobb\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of Ancient Hebrew poetry ==\n\n=== Unusual forms ===\nThe employment of unusual forms of language cannot be considered as a sign of ancient Hebrew poetry. In the sentences of [[Noah]]<ref>Such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:25-27.</ref> the form {{transl|hbo|lamo}} occurs. But this form, which represents partly {{transl|hbo|lahem}} and partly {{transl|hbo|lo}}, has many counterparts in Hebrew grammar, as, for example, {{transl|hbo|kemo}} instead of {{transl|hbo|ke-}};<ref>Exodus 15:5, 15:8.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|-emo}} = \"them\";<ref>15:9, 15:15.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|-emo}} = \"their\";<ref>[[Psalm 2]]:3.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|clemo}} = \"to them\"<ref>2:5.</ref>&mdash;forms found in passages for which no claim to poetical expressions is made. Then there are found {{transl|hbo|\u1e25ayeto}} = \"beast\",<ref>Genesis 1:24.</ref> {{transl|hbo|osri}} = \"tying\",<ref>49:11.</ref> and {{transl|hbo|yeshu'atah}} = \"salvation\"<ref>Psalm 3:3.</ref>&mdash;three forms that probably retain remnants of the old endings of the [[nominative]], [[genitive]], and [[Accusative case|accusative]]: {{transl|hbo|u(n),}} {{transl|hbo|i(n),}} {{transl|hbo|a(n).}}\n\nAgain, in [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]]'s words, \"[[Adah (biblical figure)|Adah]] and [[Zillah (biblical figure)|Zillah]], hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech\",<ref>Genesis 4:23.</ref> the two words {{transl|hbo|he'ezin}} and {{transl|hbo|imrah}} attract attention, because they occur for the first time in this passage, although there had been an earlier opportunity of using them: in Genesis 3:8 and 3:10, {{transl|hbo|He'ezin}} = \"to harken\" could have been used just as well as its synonym {{transl|hbo|shama'}} = \"to hear\".<ref>It occurs also in Exodus 15:26; Numbers 23:18 (a sentence of [[Balaam]]); [[Deuteronomy]] 1:45, 32:1; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 5:3; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 1:2, 1:10, 8:9, 28:23, 32:9, 42:23, 51:4, 44:3; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 13:15; [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 5:1; [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1:2; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 9:30 (in a prayer); and in [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 24:19 (probably an imitation of Isaiah 44:3).</ref>\n\nFurthermore, {{transl|hbo|imrah}} = \"speech\" might have been used instead of the essentially identical {{transl|hbo|dabar}} in Genesis 9:1 and following, but its earliest use is, as stated above, in Genesis 4:23.<ref>It is found also in Deuteronomy 32:2, 33:9; [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 22:31; Isaiah 5:24, 28:23, 39:4, 32:9; Psalm 12:7, etc.; [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:5; and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:17.</ref> In place of {{transl|hbo|adam}} = \"man\"<ref>Genesis 1:26 and following.</ref> {{transl|hbo|enosh}} is employed.<ref>In Deuteronomy 32:26; Isaiah 8:1, 13:7, 13:12; 24:6, 33:8; 51:7, 51:12; 56:2; Jeremiah 20:10; Psalm 8:5, 9:20, 10:18, 55:14, 56:2, 66:12, 73:5, 90:3, 103:15, 104:15, 154:3; [[Book of Job|Job]] 4:17, 5:17, 7:1, 7:17, 9:2, 10:4; 13:9, 14:19, 15:14, 25:4, 25:6, 28:4, 28:13, 32:8; 33:12, 33:26, 36:25; 2 Chronicles 14:10.</ref> (compare the Aramaic {{transl|tmr|enash}}<ref>In [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:10; [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:11, 6:11.</ref>).\n\nA [[systematic review]] of similar unusual forms of Hebrew grammar and Hebrew words occurring in certain portions of the Old Testament.<ref>See [[E. K\u00f6nig]], {{lang|de|Stilistik}}, etc., p. 277-283.</ref> Such forms have been called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} since the publication of [[Robert Lowth]]'s {{lang|la|Pr\u00e6lectiones de Sacra Poesi Hebr\u00e6orum}} iii. (1753); but this designation is ambiguous and can be accepted only in agreement with the rule {{lang|la|a parte potiori fit denominatio}} for some of these unusual forms and words are found elsewhere than in the \"songs\" of the Old Testament.\n\nThese unusual forms and expressions do not occur in all songs, and there are several Psalms that have none of these peculiarities.\n\n=== Parallelism ===\n{{main|Parallelism (rhetoric)}}\nNot even the {{lang|la|parallelismus membrorum}} is an absolutely certain indication of ancient Hebrew poetry. This \"parallelism\" occurs in the portions of the Hebrew Bible that are at the same time marked frequently by the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}}; it consists in a remarkable correspondence in the ideas expressed in two successive units (hemistiches, verses, strophes, or larger units); for example, the above-cited words of Lamech, \"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech\",<ref>Genesis 4:23</ref> in which are found {{transl|hbo|he'ezin}} and {{transl|hbo|imrah,}} show a remarkable repetition of the same thought.\n\nBut this ideal corythmy is not always present in the songs of the [[Old Testament]] or in the Psalter, as the following passages will show:\n* \"The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation\" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|15:2|9}}).\n* \"[[Saul the King| Saul]] and [[David and Jonathan| Jonathan]], the beloved and the lovely, in life and in death they were not divided\".<ref>H. P. Smith, in \"International Commentary,\" on 2 Samuel 1:23.</ref>\n* \"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, and fine linen\".<ref>2 Samuel 1:24/</ref>\n* \"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season\";<ref>Psalm 1:3; compare 2:12.</ref>\n* \"I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about\".<ref>Psalm 3:6-7 [A. V. 5-6]; see also 4:7 and following, 9:4 and following.</ref>\n\n[[Julius Ley]]<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Ley\n | first1 = Julius\n | chapter = Vom Versbau\n | title = Leitfaden der Metrik der hebr\u00e4ischen Poesie: nebst dem ersten Buche der Psalmen : nach rhythmischer Vers- und Strophenabteilung mit metrischer Analyse\n | trans-title = Outlines of the meter of Hebrew poetry: along with the first Book of Psalms: divided by rhythmic verse and stanza with metrical analysis\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfwoAAAAYAAJ\n | series = ATLA monograph preservation program\n | language = German\n | location = Halle an der Saale\n | publisher = Verlag der Buchhandlung des Waisenhauses\n | publication-date = 1887\n | page = 10\n | access-date = 14 Mar 2019\n | quote = So sehr auch der Parallelismus die ausgepr\u00e4gte Form der hebr\u00e4ischen Vesbildung ist, so halten sich die Dichter nicht der Art durch denselben gebunden, dass sie es nicht, wo der Gedanke es erfordert, denselben durchbrechen sollten.\n}}\n</ref> says therefore correctly that\n\n:\"the poets did not consider themselves bound by parallelism to such an extent as not to set it aside when the thought required it.\"\n\nThough this restriction must be made to James Robertson's view, it remains the case that:<ref>\"The Poetry of the Psalms\", 1898, p. 160.</ref> \"The distinguishing feature of the Hebrew poetry ... is the rhythmical balancing of parts, or parallelism of thought.\"\n\nVarious [[rhetoric]]al forms appear in the parallelisms of Biblical poetry.  These include:\n\n* [[Synonym]]ous parallelism; in this form, the second unit ([[hemistich]] or half line of verse, verse, strophe, or larger unit) says much the same thing as the first one, with variations.  An example appears in [[Book of Amos|Amos]] [[Amos 5:24|5:24]]:\n\n:''But let judgment run down as waters,''\n::''and righteousness as a mighty stream.''\n\nAnother example of synonymous parallelism comes in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [[Isaiah 2:4|2:4]] or [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 4:3:\n\n:\"They will beat their swords into plowshares''\n::''and their spears into pruning hooks.''\n\n* [[Antithesis]] is also found; here, the second unit directly contrasts with the first, often making the same point from the opposite perspective.  From [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 10:1:\n\n:''A wise son maketh a glad father,''\n::''but a foolish son'' is ''the heaviness of his mother.''\n\n* Emblematic parallelism occurs where one unit renders figuratively the literal meaning of another.\n* Synthetic parallelism occurs where the units balance, clause for clause, with one unit building upon or adding to the first.  From Psalm 14:2:\n\n:''The {{LORD}} looked down from heaven upon the children of men,''\n::''to see if there were any that did understand'' and ''seek God.''\n\n* [[Climax (figure of speech)| Climactic]] parallelism occurs where the second unit partially balances the first, but also adds a summative thought or completes the series.  From Psalm 29:1:\n\n:''Give unto the {{LORD}}, O ye mighty,''\n::''give unto the {{LORD}} glory and strength.''\n\n* External parallelism occurs when the syntactic units balance one another across multiple verses.  Here, some of the permitted sorts of parallelisms are added not only within a single line of verse, but also between lines.  From Isaiah 1:27-28:\n\n:''Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,''\n::''and her converts with righteousness.''\n:''And the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners'' shall be ''together,''\n::''and they that forsake the {{LORD}} shall be consumed.''\n\nExternal parallelism can also \"accumulate\" in a chiastic or \"ring\" structure that may include many verses.  For example, Psalm 1 utilizes synonymous, synthetic, and emblematic parallelism before \"turning\" antithetically back to emblematic, synthetic, and then synonymous parallels.\n\n=== Quantitative Rhythm ===\nThe poetry of the ancient Hebrews is not distinguished from the other parts of the Old Testament by rhythm based on quantity, though in view of Greek and Roman poetry it was natural to seek such a rhythm in the songs and Psalms of the Old Testament. [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], for example,<ref>{{lang|la|Poeseos Asiatic\u00e6 Commentarii}}, chapter 2, London, 1774</ref> attempted to prove that there was a definite sequence of long and short syllables in the ancient Hebrew poems; but he could support this thesis only by changing the punctuation in many ways, and by allowing great license to the Hebrew poets. However, on reading the portions of the Old Testament marked by the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} or by parallelism (e.g., Genesis 4:23 and following) no such sequence of long and short syllables can be discovered; and [[Sievers]]<ref>{{lang|de|Metrische Untersuchungen,}} 1901, \u00a7 53.</ref> says: \"Hebrew prosody is not based on quantity as classical prosody is.\"\n\n=== Accentual rhythm ===\nMany scholars hold that the Hebrew poet considered only the syllables receiving the main accent, and did not count the intervening ones. Examples contrary to this are not found in passages where forms of the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} are used, as Ley holds;<ref>In his {{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge des Rhythmus, des Vers- und Strophenbaues in der Hebr\u00e4ischen Poesie}}, p. 99, p. 116.</ref> and [[Israel Davidson]] has proved<ref>In his {{lang|de|Stilistik}}, p. 333, for example.</ref> that the choice of {{transl|hbo|lamo}} instead of {{transl|hbo|lahem}} favors in only a few passages the opinion that the poet intended to cause an accented syllable to be followed by an unaccented one.\n\nThe rhythm of Hebrew poetry may be similar to that of the German {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}} &mdash; a view that is strongly supported by the nature of the songs sung by the populace of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the early 20th century. These songs have been described by [[L. Schneller]]<ref>In his {{lang|de|Kennst Du das Land?}} (section {{lang|de|Musik}}).</ref> in the following words:\n\n:\"The rhythms are manifold; there may be eight accents in one line, and three syllables are often inserted between two accents, the symmetry and variation being determined by emotion and sentiment.\"\n\nAlso in Palestine, [[Gustaf Hermann Dalman]] observed:\n\nn:\"Lines with two, three, four, and five accented syllables may be distinguished, between which one to three, and even four, unaccented syllables may be inserted, the poet being bound by no definite number in his poem. Occasionally two accented syllables are joined\" ({{lang|de|Pal\u00e4stinischer Diwan}}, 1901, p. 23).\n\nSuch free rhythms are, in Davidson's opinion, found also in the poetry of the Old Testament. Under the stress of their thoughts and feelings the poets of Israel sought to achieve merely the material, not the formal symmetry of corresponding lines. This may be observed, for example, in the following lines of Psalm 2: \"Serve the {{LORD}} with fear\" ({{transl|hbo|'Ibdu et-Yhwh be-yir'ah}}, 2:11), \"rejoice with trembling\" ({{transl|hbo|we-gilu bi-re'adah}}). This is shown more in detail by K\u00f6nig;<ref>l.c. p. 334.</ref> and [[Carl Heinrich Cornill]] has confirmed this view<ref>{{lang|de|Die Metrischen St\u00fccke des Buches Jeremia}}, 1901, p. 8.</ref> by saying:\n\n:\"Equal length of the several stichoi was not the basic formal law of Jeremiah's metric construction.\"\n\nSievers is inclined to restrict Hebrew rhythm by various rules, as he attacks<ref>l.c. \u00a7\u00a7 52, 88.</ref> [[Karl Budde]]'s view, that\n\n:\"a foot which is lacking in one-half of a verse may find a substitute in the more ample thought of this shorter line\".<ref>{{lang|de|Handkommentar zu Hiob}}, p. 47.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the verse of the Old Testament poetry is naturally [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] or [[Anapaest|anapestic]], as the words are accented on one of the final syllables.\n\n=== The Dirges ===\nA special kind of rhythm may be observed in the [[dirge]]s, called by the Hebrews {{transl|hbo|kinot}}. A whole book of these elegies is contained in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the first of them beginning thus: \"How does the city sit solitary&mdash;that was full of people&mdash;how is she become as a widow&mdash;she that was great among the nations&mdash;and princess among the provinces&mdash;how is she become tributary!\" (Lamentations 1:1).\n\nThe rhythm of such lines lies in the fact that a longer line is always followed by a shorter one. As in the [[elegiac couplet]] of Greco-Roman poetry, this change was intended to symbolize the idea that a strenuous advance in life is followed by fatigue or reaction. This rhythm, which may be designated \"elegiac measure,\" occurs also in Amos 5:2, expressly designated as a \u1e33inah. The sad import of his prophecies induced Jeremiah also to employ the rhythm of the dirges several times in his utterances (Jeremiah 9:20, 13:18 and following). He refers here expressly to the {{transl|hbo|me\u1e33onenot}} (the mourning women) who in the East still chant the death-song to the trembling tone of the pipe (48:36 and following). {{transl|hbo|\u1e32inot}} are found also in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 19:1, 26:17, 27:2, 32:2 and following, 32:16, 32:19 and following.\n\nThis elegiac measure, being naturally a well-known one, was used also elsewhere, as, for example, in Psalm 19:8-10. The rhythm of the \u1e33inah has been analyzed especially by Budde (in Stade's {{lang|de|Zeitschrift}}, 1883, p. 299). Similar funeral songs of the modern [[Arab]]s are quoted by Wetzstein (in {{lang|de|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie}}, v. 298), as, e.g.: \"O, if he only could be ransomed! truly, I would pay the ransom!\" (see K\u00f6nig, l.c. p. 315).\n\n=== Anadiplosis ===\nA special kind of rhythm was produced by the frequent employment of the so-called anadiplosis, a mode of speech in which the phrase at the end of one sentence is repeated at the beginning of the next, as, for instance, in the passages \"they came not to the help of the Lord [i.e., to protect God's people], to the help of the Lord against the mighty\" (Judges 5:23; compare {{transl|hbo|\u1e93id\u1e33ot}} [5:11a] and {{transl|hbo|nil\u1e25amu}} [5:19a-20a, b]), and \"From whence shall my help come? My help cometh from the Lord\" (Psalm 121:1b-2a, R. V.).\n\nMany similar passages occur in fifteen of the Psalms, 120-134, which also contain an unusual number of epanalepsis, or catch-words, for which Israel Davidson proposed the name {{lang|de|Leitt\u00f6ne.}} Thus there is the repetition of {{transl|hbo|shakan}} in Psalm 120:5, 6; of {{transl|hbo|shalom}} in verses 6 and 7 of the same psalm; and the catch-word {{transl|hbo|yishmor}} in Psalm 121:7, 8 (all the cases are enumerated in K\u00f6nig, l.c. p.&nbsp;302).\n\nAs the employment of such repetitions is somewhat suggestive of the mounting of stairs, the superscription {{transl|hbo|shir ha-ma'alot,}} found at the beginning of these fifteen psalms, may have a double meaning: it may indicate not only the purpose of these songs, to be sung on the pilgrimages to the festivals at [[Jerusalem]], but also the peculiar construction of the songs, by which the reciter is led from one step of the inner life to the next. Such graduated rhythm may be observed elsewhere; for the peasants in modern [[Syria]] accompany their national dance by a song the verses of which are connected like the links of a chain, each verse beginning with the final words of the preceding one (Wetzstein, l.c. v. 292).\n\n=== Acrostics ===\nAlphabetical [[acrostic]]s are used as an external embellishment of a few poems. The letters of the alphabet, generally in their ordinary sequence, stand at the beginning of smaller or larger sections of Psalms 9-10 (probably), 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145; Proverbs 31:10-31; Lamentations 1-4; and also of Sirach 51:13-29, as the newly discovered Hebrew text of this book has shown (see, on Psalms 25 and 34 especially, Hirsch in \"Am. Jour. Semit. Lang.\" 1902, p. 167-173).\n\nAlphabetical and other acrostics occur frequently in Neo-Hebraic poetry.<ref>Winter and W\u00fcnsche, {{lang|de|Die J\u00fcdische Literatur seit Abschluss des Kanons,}} 1894-1896, iii. 10.</ref> The existence of acrostics in Babylonian literature has been definitely proved;<ref>[[H. Zimmern]], in {{lang|de|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung,}} 1895, p. 15.</ref> and alphabetical poems are found also among the Samaritans, Syrians, and Arabs. Cicero says ({{lang|la|De Divinatione,}} II.54) that the verse of the sibyl was in acrostics; and the so-called {{lang|la|[[Oracula Sibyllina]]}} contain an acrostic.<ref>In book 8, lines 217-250.</ref>\n\nA secondary phenomenon, which distinguishes a part of the poems of the Old Testament from the other parts, is the so-called {{lang|la|[[accentuatio poetica]]}}; it has been much slighted (Sievers, l.c. \u00a7 248, p.&nbsp;375). Although not all the poetical portions of the Old Testament are marked by a special accentuation, the Book of Job in 3:3-42:6 and the books of Psalms and Proverbs throughout have received unusual accents. This point will be further discussed later on.\n\n== Division of the poetical portions of the Hebrew Bible ==\n\n=== Poems that deal with events ===\nFirst may be mentioned poems that deal principally with events, being epic-lyric in character: the triumphal song of Israel delivered from Egypt, or the ''[[song of the sea]]'';<ref>Exodus 15:1-18.</ref> the mocking song on the burning of [[Heshbon]];<ref>Numbers 21:27-30.</ref> the so-called ''[[song of Moses]]'';<ref>Deuteronomy 32:1-43.</ref> the [[song of Deborah]];<ref>Judges 5.</ref> the derisive song of victory of the Israelite women;<ref>\"Saul hath slain,\" etc.; 1 Samuel 18:7</ref> [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]]'s song of praise;<ref>2:1-10.</ref> [[David]]'s song of praise on being saved from his enemies;<ref>2 Samuel 22.</ref> [[Hezekiah]]'s song of praise on his recovery;<ref>Isaiah 38:9-20.</ref> [[Jonah]]'s song of praise;<ref>[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] 2:3-10.</ref> and many of the Psalms, e.g., those on the creation of the world,<ref>8, 104).</ref> and on the election of Israel.<ref>99, 100, 105.</ref> A subdivision is formed by poems that deal more with description and praise: the so-called Well song;<ref>Numbers 21:17 and following.</ref> the song of praise on the uniqueness of the god of Israel;<ref>Psalms 95, 97.</ref> and those on his eternity;<ref>90.</ref> his omnipresence and omniscience;<ref>139.</ref> and his omnipotence.<ref>115.</ref>\n\n=== Didactic poems ===\nPoems appealing more to reason, being essentially [[didactic]] in character. These include [[fable]]s, like that of [[Jotham]] (Judges 9:7-15, although in prose); [[parable]]s, like those of [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] and others (2 Samuel 12:1-4, 14:4-9; [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 20:39 and following, all three in prose), or in the form of a song (Isaiah 5:1-6); [[riddle]]s (Judges 14:14 and following; Proverbs 30:11 and following); maxims, as, for instance, in 1 Samuel 15:22, 24:14, and the greater part of Proverbs; the monologues and dialogues in Job 3:3 and following; compare also the reflections in monologue in [[Ecclesiastes]]. A number of the Psalms also are didactic in character. A series of them impresses the fact that God's law teaches one to abhor sin (Psalms 5, 58), and inculcates a true love for the Temple and the feasts of Yahweh (Psalms 15, 81, 92). Another series of Psalms shows that God is just, although it may at times not seem this way to a short-sighted observer of the world and of history (\"theodicies\": Psalms 49, 73; compare Psalms 16, 56, 60).\n\n=== Lyrics ===\nPoems that portray feelings based on individual experience. Many of these lyrics express joy, as, e.g., Lamech's so-called ''[[Song of the sword]]'';<ref>Beginning at Genesis 4:23.</ref> David's \"last words\";<ref>2 Samuel 23:1-7.</ref> the words of praise of liberated Israel;<ref>Isaiah 12:1-6.</ref> songs of praise like Psalms 18, 24, 126, etc. Other lyrics express mourning. First among these are the dirges proper for the dead, as the [[\u1e33inah]] on the death of Saul and Jonathan;<ref>2 Samuel 1:19-27.</ref> that on [[Abner]]'s death;<ref>3:33 and following.</ref> and all psalms of mourning, as, e.g., the expressions of sorrow of sufferers,<ref>Psalms 16, 22, 27, 39.</ref> and the expressions of penitence of sinners.<ref>6, 32, 38, 51, 106, 130, 143.</ref>\n\n=== Poems that urge action ===\nFinally, a large group of poems of the Old Testament that urge action and are exhortatory. These may be divided into two sections:\n\n# The poet wishes something for himself, as in the so-called \"signal words\" (Numbers 10:35 and following, \"Arise, {{LORD}}\" etc.); at the beginning of the Well song (21:17 and following, {{transl|hbo|ali be'er}}); in the daring request, \"Sun, stand thou still\" ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12); in [[Habakkuk]]'s prayer ({{transl|hbo|tefillah}}; [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] 3:1-19); or in psalms of request for help in time of war (44, 60, etc.) or for liberation from prison (122, 137, etc.).\n# The poet pronounces blessings upon others, endeavoring to move God to grant these wishes. To this group belong the blessing of Noah (Genesis 9:25-27), of [[Isaac]] (27:28-29 and 39-40), and of [[Jacob]] (49:3-27); [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]'s congratulation of Israel (Exodus 18:10); the blessing of [[Aaron]] (Numbers 6:24-26) and of [[Balaam]] (23:7-10, 18-24, 24:5-9, 24:17-24); Moses' farewell (Deuteronomy 33:1 and following); the psalms that begin with {{transl|hbo|Ashre}} = \"Blessed is,\" etc., or contain this phrase, as Psalms 1, 41, 84:5 and following, 84:13, 112, 119, 128.\n\nIt was natural that in the drama, which is intended to portray a whole series of external and internal events, several of the foregoing kinds of poems should be combined. This combination occurs in [[Song of Songs|Canticles]], which, in Davidson's opinion, is most correctly characterized as a kind of drama.\n\nThe peculiar sublimity of the poems of the Old Testament is due partly to the high development of monotheism which finds expression therein and partly to the beauty of the moral ideals which they exalt. This subject has been discussed  by [[J. D. Michaelis]] in the preface to his Arabic grammar, second edition, p29, and by [[Emil Kautzsch]] in {{lang|de|Die Poesie und die Poetischen B\u00fccher des A. T.}} (1902)\nalthough this all may be true he Hebrew poetry follows a totally different rhyming scheme and as it has been translated into English we cannot comprehend this.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n*[[Poetry]]\n*[[Hebrew Bible]]\n*[[Yemenite Jewish poetry]]\n*[[List of national poetries]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n*{{JewishEncyclopedia}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | edition = Second | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-02256-1 | last = Alter | first = Robert | title = The Art of Biblical Poetry | date = 2011-09-06 | authorlink = Robert Alter }}\n*{{Cite book | publisher = W.

H. Cobb\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of Ancient Hebrew poetry ==\n\n=== Unusual forms ===\nThe employment of unusual forms of language cannot be considered as a sign of ancient Hebrew poetry. In the sentences of [[Noah]]<ref>Such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:25-27.</ref> the form {{transl|hbo|lamo}} occurs. But this form, which represents partly {{transl|hbo|lahem}} and partly {{transl|hbo|lo}}, has many counterparts in Hebrew grammar, as, for example, {{transl|hbo|kemo}} instead of {{transl|hbo|ke-}};<ref>Exodus 15:5, 15:8.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|-emo}} = \"them\";<ref>15:9, 15:15.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|-emo}} = \"their\";<ref>[[Psalm 2]]:3.</ref> or {{transl|hbo|clemo}} = \"to them\"<ref>2:5.</ref>&mdash;forms found in passages for which no claim to poetical expressions is made. Then there are found {{transl|hbo|\u1e25ayeto}} = \"beast\",<ref>Genesis 1:24.</ref> {{transl|hbo|osri}} = \"tying\",<ref>49:11.</ref> and {{transl|hbo|yeshu'atah}} = \"salvation\"<ref>Psalm 3:3.</ref>&mdash;three forms that probably retain remnants of the old endings of the [[nominative]], [[genitive]], and [[Accusative case|accusative]]: {{transl|hbo|u(n),}} {{transl|hbo|i(n),}} {{transl|hbo|a(n).}}\n\nAgain, in [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]]'s words, \"[[Adah (biblical figure)|Adah]] and [[Zillah (biblical figure)|Zillah]], hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech\",<ref>Genesis 4:23.</ref> the two words {{transl|hbo|he'ezin}} and {{transl|hbo|imrah}} attract attention, because they occur for the first time in this passage, although there had been an earlier opportunity of using them: in Genesis 3:8 and 3:10, {{transl|hbo|He'ezin}} = \"to harken\" could have been used just as well as its synonym {{transl|hbo|shama'}} = \"to hear\".<ref>It occurs also in Exodus 15:26; Numbers 23:18 (a sentence of [[Balaam]]); [[Deuteronomy]] 1:45, 32:1; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 5:3; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 1:2, 1:10, 8:9, 28:23, 32:9, 42:23, 51:4, 44:3; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 13:15; [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 5:1; [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1:2; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 9:30 (in a prayer); and in [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 24:19 (probably an imitation of Isaiah 44:3).</ref>\n\nFurthermore, {{transl|hbo|imrah}} = \"speech\" might have been used instead of the essentially identical {{transl|hbo|dabar}} in Genesis 9:1 and following, but its earliest use is, as stated above, in Genesis 4:23.<ref>It is found also in Deuteronomy 32:2, 33:9; [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 22:31; Isaiah 5:24, 28:23, 39:4, 32:9; Psalm 12:7, etc.; [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:5; and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:17.</ref> In place of {{transl|hbo|adam}} = \"man\"<ref>Genesis 1:26 and following.</ref> {{transl|hbo|enosh}} is employed.<ref>In Deuteronomy 32:26; Isaiah 8:1, 13:7, 13:12; 24:6, 33:8; 51:7, 51:12; 56:2; Jeremiah 20:10; Psalm 8:5, 9:20, 10:18, 55:14, 56:2, 66:12, 73:5, 90:3, 103:15, 104:15, 154:3; [[Book of Job|Job]] 4:17, 5:17, 7:1, 7:17, 9:2, 10:4; 13:9, 14:19, 15:14, 25:4, 25:6, 28:4, 28:13, 32:8; 33:12, 33:26, 36:25; 2 Chronicles 14:10.</ref> (compare the Aramaic {{transl|tmr|enash}}<ref>In [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:10; [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:11, 6:11.</ref>).\n\nA [[systematic review]] of similar unusual forms of Hebrew grammar and Hebrew words occurring in certain portions of the Old Testament.<ref>See [[E. K\u00f6nig]], {{lang|de|Stilistik}}, etc., p. 277-283.</ref> Such forms have been called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} since the publication of [[Robert Lowth]]'s {{lang|la|Pr\u00e6lectiones de Sacra Poesi Hebr\u00e6orum}} iii. (1753); but this designation is ambiguous and can be accepted only in agreement with the rule {{lang|la|a parte potiori fit denominatio}} for some of these unusual forms and words are found elsewhere than in the \"songs\" of the Old Testament.\n\nThese unusual forms and expressions do not occur in all songs, and there are several Psalms that have none of these peculiarities.\n\n=== Parallelism ===\n{{main|Parallelism (rhetoric)}}\nNot even the {{lang|la|parallelismus membrorum}} is an absolutely certain indication of ancient Hebrew poetry. This \"parallelism\" occurs in the portions of the Old Testament that are at the same time marked frequently by the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}}; it consists in a remarkable correspondence in the ideas expressed in two successive units (hemistiches, verses, strophes, or larger units); for example, the above-cited words of Lamech, \"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech\",<ref>Genesis 4:23</ref> in which are found {{transl|hbo|he'ezin}} and {{transl|hbo|imrah,}} show a remarkable repetition of the same thought.\n\nBut this ideal corythmy is not always present in the songs of the [[Old Testament]] or in the Psalter, as the following passages will show:\n* \"The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation\" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|15:2|9}}).\n* \"[[Saul the King| Saul]] and [[David and Jonathan| Jonathan]], the beloved and the lovely, in life and in death they were not divided\".<ref>H. P. Smith, in \"International Commentary,\" on 2 Samuel 1:23.</ref>\n* \"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, and fine linen\".<ref>2 Samuel 1:24/</ref>\n* \"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season\";<ref>Psalm 1:3; compare 2:12.</ref>\n* \"I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about\".<ref>Psalm 3:6-7 [A. V. 5-6]; see also 4:7 and following, 9:4 and following.</ref>\n\n[[Julius Ley]]<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Ley\n | first1 = Julius\n | chapter = Vom Versbau\n | title = Leitfaden der Metrik der hebr\u00e4ischen Poesie: nebst dem ersten Buche der Psalmen : nach rhythmischer Vers- und Strophenabteilung mit metrischer Analyse\n | trans-title = Outlines of the meter of Hebrew poetry: along with the first Book of Psalms: divided by rhythmic verse and stanza with metrical analysis\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfwoAAAAYAAJ\n | series = ATLA monograph preservation program\n | language = German\n | location = Halle an der Saale\n | publisher = Verlag der Buchhandlung des Waisenhauses\n | publication-date = 1887\n | page = 10\n | access-date = 14 Mar 2019\n | quote = So sehr auch der Parallelismus die ausgepr\u00e4gte Form der hebr\u00e4ischen Vesbildung ist, so halten sich die Dichter nicht der Art durch denselben gebunden, dass sie es nicht, wo der Gedanke es erfordert, denselben durchbrechen sollten.\n}}\n</ref> says therefore correctly that\n\n:\"the poets did not consider themselves bound by parallelism to such an extent as not to set it aside when the thought required it.\"\n\nThough this restriction must be made to James Robertson's view, it remains the case that:<ref>\"The Poetry of the Psalms\", 1898, p. 160.</ref> \"The distinguishing feature of the Hebrew poetry ... is the rhythmical balancing of parts, or parallelism of thought.\"\n\nVarious [[rhetoric]]al forms appear in the parallelisms of Biblical poetry.  These include:\n\n* [[Synonym]]ous parallelism; in this form, the second unit ([[hemistich]] or half line of verse, verse, strophe, or larger unit) says much the same thing as the first one, with variations.  An example appears in [[Book of Amos|Amos]] [[Amos 5:24|5:24]]:\n\n:''But let judgment run down as waters,''\n::''and righteousness as a mighty stream.''\n\nAnother example of synonymous parallelism comes in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [[Isaiah 2:4|2:4]] or [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 4:3:\n\n:\"They will beat their swords into plowshares''\n::''and their spears into pruning hooks.''\n\n* [[Antithesis]] is also found; here, the second unit directly contrasts with the first, often making the same point from the opposite perspective.  From [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 10:1:\n\n:''A wise son maketh a glad father,''\n::''but a foolish son'' is ''the heaviness of his mother.''\n\n* Emblematic parallelism occurs where one unit renders figuratively the literal meaning of another.\n* Synthetic parallelism occurs where the units balance, clause for clause, with one unit building upon or adding to the first.  From Psalm 14:2:\n\n:''The {{LORD}} looked down from heaven upon the children of men,''\n::''to see if there were any that did understand'' and ''seek God.''\n\n* [[Climax (figure of speech)| Climactic]] parallelism occurs where the second unit partially balances the first, but also adds a summative thought or completes the series.  From Psalm 29:1:\n\n:''Give unto the {{LORD}}, O ye mighty,''\n::''give unto the {{LORD}} glory and strength.''\n\n* External parallelism occurs when the syntactic units balance one another across multiple verses.  Here, some of the permitted sorts of parallelisms are added not only within a single line of verse, but also between lines.  From Isaiah 1:27-28:\n\n:''Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,''\n::''and her converts with righteousness.''\n:''And the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners'' shall be ''together,''\n::''and they that forsake the {{LORD}} shall be consumed.''\n\nExternal parallelism can also \"accumulate\" in a chiastic or \"ring\" structure that may include many verses.  For example, Psalm 1 utilizes synonymous, synthetic, and emblematic parallelism before \"turning\" antithetically back to emblematic, synthetic, and then synonymous parallels.\n\n=== Quantitative Rhythm ===\nThe poetry of the ancient Hebrews is not distinguished from the other parts of the Old Testament by rhythm based on quantity, though in view of Greek and Roman poetry it was natural to seek such a rhythm in the songs and Psalms of the Old Testament. [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], for example,<ref>{{lang|la|Poeseos Asiatic\u00e6 Commentarii}}, chapter 2, London, 1774</ref> attempted to prove that there was a definite sequence of long and short syllables in the ancient Hebrew poems; but he could support this thesis only by changing the punctuation in many ways, and by allowing great license to the Hebrew poets. However, on reading the portions of the Old Testament marked by the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} or by parallelism (e.g., Genesis 4:23 and following) no such sequence of long and short syllables can be discovered; and [[Sievers]]<ref>{{lang|de|Metrische Untersuchungen,}} 1901, \u00a7 53.</ref> says: \"Hebrew prosody is not based on quantity as classical prosody is.\"\n\n=== Accentual rhythm ===\nMany scholars hold that the Hebrew poet considered only the syllables receiving the main accent, and did not count the intervening ones. Examples contrary to this are not found in passages where forms of the so-called {{lang|la|dialectus poetica}} are used, as Ley holds;<ref>In his {{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge des Rhythmus, des Vers- und Strophenbaues in der Hebr\u00e4ischen Poesie}}, p. 99, p. 116.</ref> and [[Israel Davidson]] has proved<ref>In his {{lang|de|Stilistik}}, p. 333, for example.</ref> that the choice of {{transl|hbo|lamo}} instead of {{transl|hbo|lahem}} favors in only a few passages the opinion that the poet intended to cause an accented syllable to be followed by an unaccented one.\n\nThe rhythm of Hebrew poetry may be similar to that of the German {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}} &mdash; a view that is strongly supported by the nature of the songs sung by the populace of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the early 20th century. These songs have been described by [[L. Schneller]]<ref>In his {{lang|de|Kennst Du das Land?}} (section {{lang|de|Musik}}).</ref> in the following words:\n\n:\"The rhythms are manifold; there may be eight accents in one line, and three syllables are often inserted between two accents, the symmetry and variation being determined by emotion and sentiment.\"\n\nAlso in Palestine, [[Gustaf Hermann Dalman]] observed:\n\nn:\"Lines with two, three, four, and five accented syllables may be distinguished, between which one to three, and even four, unaccented syllables may be inserted, the poet being bound by no definite number in his poem. Occasionally two accented syllables are joined\" ({{lang|de|Pal\u00e4stinischer Diwan}}, 1901, p. 23).\n\nSuch free rhythms are, in Davidson's opinion, found also in the poetry of the Old Testament. Under the stress of their thoughts and feelings the poets of Israel sought to achieve merely the material, not the formal symmetry of corresponding lines. This may be observed, for example, in the following lines of Psalm 2: \"Serve the {{LORD}} with fear\" ({{transl|hbo|'Ibdu et-Yhwh be-yir'ah}}, 2:11), \"rejoice with trembling\" ({{transl|hbo|we-gilu bi-re'adah}}). This is shown more in detail by K\u00f6nig;<ref>l.c. p. 334.</ref> and [[Carl Heinrich Cornill]] has confirmed this view<ref>{{lang|de|Die Metrischen St\u00fccke des Buches Jeremia}}, 1901, p. 8.</ref> by saying:\n\n:\"Equal length of the several stichoi was not the basic formal law of Jeremiah's metric construction.\"\n\nSievers is inclined to restrict Hebrew rhythm by various rules, as he attacks<ref>l.c. \u00a7\u00a7 52, 88.</ref> [[Karl Budde]]'s view, that\n\n:\"a foot which is lacking in one-half of a verse may find a substitute in the more ample thought of this shorter line\".<ref>{{lang|de|Handkommentar zu Hiob}}, p. 47.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the verse of the Old Testament poetry is naturally [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] or [[Anapaest|anapestic]], as the words are accented on one of the final syllables.\n\n=== The Dirges ===\nA special kind of rhythm may be observed in the [[dirge]]s, called by the Hebrews {{transl|hbo|kinot}}. A whole book of these elegies is contained in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the first of them beginning thus: \"How does the city sit solitary&mdash;that was full of people&mdash;how is she become as a widow&mdash;she that was great among the nations&mdash;and princess among the provinces&mdash;how is she become tributary!\" (Lamentations 1:1).\n\nThe rhythm of such lines lies in the fact that a longer line is always followed by a shorter one. As in the [[elegiac couplet]] of Greco-Roman poetry, this change was intended to symbolize the idea that a strenuous advance in life is followed by fatigue or reaction. This rhythm, which may be designated \"elegiac measure,\" occurs also in Amos 5:2, expressly designated as a \u1e33inah. The sad import of his prophecies induced Jeremiah also to employ the rhythm of the dirges several times in his utterances (Jeremiah 9:20, 13:18 and following). He refers here expressly to the {{transl|hbo|me\u1e33onenot}} (the mourning women) who in the East still chant the death-song to the trembling tone of the pipe (48:36 and following). {{transl|hbo|\u1e32inot}} are found also in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 19:1, 26:17, 27:2, 32:2 and following, 32:16, 32:19 and following.\n\nThis elegiac measure, being naturally a well-known one, was used also elsewhere, as, for example, in Psalm 19:8-10. The rhythm of the \u1e33inah has been analyzed especially by Budde (in Stade's {{lang|de|Zeitschrift}}, 1883, p. 299). Similar funeral songs of the modern [[Arab]]s are quoted by Wetzstein (in {{lang|de|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie}}, v. 298), as, e.g.: \"O, if he only could be ransomed! truly, I would pay the ransom!\" (see K\u00f6nig, l.c. p. 315).\n\n=== Anadiplosis ===\nA special kind of rhythm was produced by the frequent employment of the so-called anadiplosis, a mode of speech in which the phrase at the end of one sentence is repeated at the beginning of the next, as, for instance, in the passages \"they came not to the help of the Lord [i.e., to protect God's people], to the help of the Lord against the mighty\" (Judges 5:23; compare {{transl|hbo|\u1e93id\u1e33ot}} [5:11a] and {{transl|hbo|nil\u1e25amu}} [5:19a-20a, b]), and \"From whence shall my help come? My help cometh from the Lord\" (Psalm 121:1b-2a, R. V.).\n\nMany similar passages occur in fifteen of the Psalms, 120-134, which also contain an unusual number of epanalepsis, or catch-words, for which Israel Davidson proposed the name {{lang|de|Leitt\u00f6ne.}} Thus there is the repetition of {{transl|hbo|shakan}} in Psalm 120:5, 6; of {{transl|hbo|shalom}} in verses 6 and 7 of the same psalm; and the catch-word {{transl|hbo|yishmor}} in Psalm 121:7, 8 (all the cases are enumerated in K\u00f6nig, l.c. p.&nbsp;302).\n\nAs the employment of such repetitions is somewhat suggestive of the mounting of stairs, the superscription {{transl|hbo|shir ha-ma'alot,}} found at the beginning of these fifteen psalms, may have a double meaning: it may indicate not only the purpose of these songs, to be sung on the pilgrimages to the festivals at [[Jerusalem]], but also the peculiar construction of the songs, by which the reciter is led from one step of the inner life to the next. Such graduated rhythm may be observed elsewhere; for the peasants in modern [[Syria]] accompany their national dance by a song the verses of which are connected like the links of a chain, each verse beginning with the final words of the preceding one (Wetzstein, l.c. v. 292).\n\n=== Acrostics ===\nAlphabetical [[acrostic]]s are used as an external embellishment of a few poems. The letters of the alphabet, generally in their ordinary sequence, stand at the beginning of smaller or larger sections of Psalms 9-10 (probably), 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145; Proverbs 31:10-31; Lamentations 1-4; and also of Sirach 51:13-29, as the newly discovered Hebrew text of this book has shown (see, on Psalms 25 and 34 especially, Hirsch in \"Am. Jour. Semit. Lang.\" 1902, p. 167-173).\n\nAlphabetical and other acrostics occur frequently in Neo-Hebraic poetry.<ref>Winter and W\u00fcnsche, {{lang|de|Die J\u00fcdische Literatur seit Abschluss des Kanons,}} 1894-1896, iii. 10.</ref> The existence of acrostics in Babylonian literature has been definitely proved;<ref>[[H. Zimmern]], in {{lang|de|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Keilschriftforschung,}} 1895, p. 15.</ref> and alphabetical poems are found also among the Samaritans, Syrians, and Arabs. Cicero says ({{lang|la|De Divinatione,}} II.54) that the verse of the sibyl was in acrostics; and the so-called {{lang|la|[[Oracula Sibyllina]]}} contain an acrostic.<ref>In book 8, lines 217-250.</ref>\n\nA secondary phenomenon, which distinguishes a part of the poems of the Old Testament from the other parts, is the so-called {{lang|la|[[accentuatio poetica]]}}; it has been much slighted (Sievers, l.c. \u00a7 248, p.&nbsp;375). Although not all the poetical portions of the Old Testament are marked by a special accentuation, the Book of Job in 3:3-42:6 and the books of Psalms and Proverbs throughout have received unusual accents. This point will be further discussed later on.\n\n== Division of the poetical portions of the Hebrew Bible ==\n\n=== Poems that deal with events ===\nFirst may be mentioned poems that deal principally with events, being epic-lyric in character: the triumphal song of Israel delivered from Egypt, or the ''[[song of the sea]]'';<ref>Exodus 15:1-18.</ref> the mocking song on the burning of [[Heshbon]];<ref>Numbers 21:27-30.</ref> the so-called ''[[song of Moses]]'';<ref>Deuteronomy 32:1-43.</ref> the [[song of Deborah]];<ref>Judges 5.</ref> the derisive song of victory of the Israelite women;<ref>\"Saul hath slain,\" etc.; 1 Samuel 18:7</ref> [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]]'s song of praise;<ref>2:1-10.</ref> [[David]]'s song of praise on being saved from his enemies;<ref>2 Samuel 22.</ref> [[Hezekiah]]'s song of praise on his recovery;<ref>Isaiah 38:9-20.</ref> [[Jonah]]'s song of praise;<ref>[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] 2:3-10.</ref> and many of the Psalms, e.g., those on the creation of the world,<ref>8, 104).</ref> and on the election of Israel.<ref>99, 100, 105.</ref> A subdivision is formed by poems that deal more with description and praise: the so-called Well song;<ref>Numbers 21:17 and following.</ref> the song of praise on the uniqueness of the god of Israel;<ref>Psalms 95, 97.</ref> and those on his eternity;<ref>90.</ref> his omnipresence and omniscience;<ref>139.</ref> and his omnipotence.<ref>115.</ref>\n\n=== Didactic poems ===\nPoems appealing more to reason, being essentially [[didactic]] in character. These include [[fable]]s, like that of [[Jotham]] (Judges 9:7-15, although in prose); [[parable]]s, like those of [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] and others (2 Samuel 12:1-4, 14:4-9; [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 20:39 and following, all three in prose), or in the form of a song (Isaiah 5:1-6); [[riddle]]s (Judges 14:14 and following; Proverbs 30:11 and following); maxims, as, for instance, in 1 Samuel 15:22, 24:14, and the greater part of Proverbs; the monologues and dialogues in Job 3:3 and following; compare also the reflections in monologue in [[Ecclesiastes]]. A number of the Psalms also are didactic in character. A series of them impresses the fact that God's law teaches one to abhor sin (Psalms 5, 58), and inculcates a true love for the Temple and the feasts of Yahweh (Psalms 15, 81, 92). Another series of Psalms shows that God is just, although it may at times not seem this way to a short-sighted observer of the world and of history (\"theodicies\": Psalms 49, 73; compare Psalms 16, 56, 60).\n\n=== Lyrics ===\nPoems that portray feelings based on individual experience. Many of these lyrics express joy, as, e.g., Lamech's so-called ''[[Song of the sword]]'';<ref>Beginning at Genesis 4:23.</ref> David's \"last words\";<ref>2 Samuel 23:1-7.</ref> the words of praise of liberated Israel;<ref>Isaiah 12:1-6.</ref> songs of praise like Psalms 18, 24, 126, etc. Other lyrics express mourning. First among these are the dirges proper for the dead, as the [[\u1e33inah]] on the death of Saul and Jonathan;<ref>2 Samuel 1:19-27.</ref> that on [[Abner]]'s death;<ref>3:33 and following.</ref> and all psalms of mourning, as, e.g., the expressions of sorrow of sufferers,<ref>Psalms 16, 22, 27, 39.</ref> and the expressions of penitence of sinners.<ref>6, 32, 38, 51, 106, 130, 143.</ref>\n\n=== Poems that urge action ===\nFinally, a large group of poems of the Old Testament that urge action and are exhortatory. These may be divided into two sections:\n\n# The poet wishes something for himself, as in the so-called \"signal words\" (Numbers 10:35 and following, \"Arise, {{LORD}}\" etc.); at the beginning of the Well song (21:17 and following, {{transl|hbo|ali be'er}}); in the daring request, \"Sun, stand thou still\" ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12); in [[Habakkuk]]'s prayer ({{transl|hbo|tefillah}}; [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] 3:1-19); or in psalms of request for help in time of war (44, 60, etc.) or for liberation from prison (122, 137, etc.).\n# The poet pronounces blessings upon others, endeavoring to move God to grant these wishes. To this group belong the blessing of Noah (Genesis 9:25-27), of [[Isaac]] (27:28-29 and 39-40), and of [[Jacob]] (49:3-27); [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]'s congratulation of Israel (Exodus 18:10); the blessing of [[Aaron]] (Numbers 6:24-26) and of [[Balaam]] (23:7-10, 18-24, 24:5-9, 24:17-24); Moses' farewell (Deuteronomy 33:1 and following); the psalms that begin with {{transl|hbo|Ashre}} = \"Blessed is,\" etc., or contain this phrase, as Psalms 1, 41, 84:5 and following, 84:13, 112, 119, 128.\n\nIt was natural that in the drama, which is intended to portray a whole series of external and internal events, several of the foregoing kinds of poems should be combined. This combination occurs in [[Song of Songs|Canticles]], which, in Davidson's opinion, is most correctly characterized as a kind of drama.\n\nThe peculiar sublimity of the poems of the Old Testament is due partly to the high development of monotheism which finds expression therein and partly to the beauty of the moral ideals which they exalt. This subject has been discussed  by [[J. D. Michaelis]] in the preface to his Arabic grammar, second edition, p29, and by [[Emil Kautzsch]] in {{lang|de|Die Poesie und die Poetischen B\u00fccher des A. T.}} (1902)\nalthough this all may be true he Hebrew poetry follows a totally different rhyming scheme and as it has been translated into English we cannot comprehend this.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n*[[Poetry]]\n*[[Hebrew Bible]]\n*[[Yemenite Jewish poetry]]\n*[[List of national poetries]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n*{{JewishEncyclopedia}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | edition = Second | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-02256-1 | last = Alter | first = Robert | title = The Art of Biblical Poetry | date = 2011-09-06 | authorlink = Robert Alter }}\n*{{Cite book | publisher = W.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.  [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]],  [[Coimbatore]] , [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]]  and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.

European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states.

The premier English antiquarian society, the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], which had received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1745, was also in an impoverished state, having virtually bankrupted itself as the result of publishing ventures.<ref>[[Joan Evans (art historian)|Joan Evans]]\"A History of the Society of Antiquaries\", Oxford, 1956, 258\u201360</ref> In Scotland the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] had been established in Edinburgh in 1780, while in Ireland the [[Royal Irish Academy]], established in 1786, had its own Antiquities Section, and in 1890 the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] had been formed from the Kilkenny Archaeological Society.[[File:Tower , near Mold 1846.jpeg|thumb|Tower, Broncoed, near Mold 1846. Soft Ground etching by Harry Longueville Jones, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', vol. 1 (1846), p. 54]] Against this background the [[British Archaeological Association]] was founded in 1844, and was followed rapidly by a breakaway group, the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]], which pioneered a model of holding annual meetings or congresses in various parts of the British Isles and producing an annual journal (published in quarterly parts). This was the model adopted by Cambrian Archaeological Association for Wales and the Marches.\n\nThe driving figure in the establishment of the Cambrian Archaeological Association was the Rev. [[Harry Longueville Jones]]<ref>Longueville Jones took his name from inheriting the Longueville estates in Shropshire.  Sir Ben Bowen Thomas \"Arch Camb\" 127, apparently erroneously says that his mother came from the French Longueville family, which seems most unlikely as her maiden name was Stephen</ref> who was supported by the celticist the Rev [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]]. Rather than form a society directly, Longueville Jones produced a 'manifesto' -''On the study and preservation of national antiquities''- calling on interested people to join together and form an association.<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol 1.</ref> Longueville Jones at this date was living at [[Beaumaris]] in Anglesey.  Between 1834 and 1842 he lived in Paris, where he worked for the English language publisher [[John Anthony Galignani|Galignani]] and edited several editions of Galignani's Paris Guide.  He worked with leading literary figures including [[William Thackeray]]. The ideas he put forward owed much to current developments in France, which followed the appointment in 1834 of the French novelist [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] as the first Inspector-General of ''Monuments Historiques''.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Fermigier, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e et l'inspection des monuments historiques, dans Pierre Nora (dir.), Les lieux de m\u00e9moire, vol. 1, Paris: Gallimard Quarto, 1997, p. 1599-1614.</ref> Longueville was also a talented artist and his work was used to illustrate early volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''.\n\n===Early years 1847\u20131855===\n[[File:Sir Stephen Glynne 01.jpeg|thumb|left|Sir Stephen Glynne, president 1847/9]]\nThe first annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society was held at Aberystwyth between 7 and 10 September 1847, and the first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Richard Glynne]]. By the time of the second annual meeting at Caernarvon it was claimed that the membership had grown to 350. Initially the association was well supported by members of the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]]. In 1849 [[Harry Longueville Jones]] resigned as joint general secretary on his appointment to the Civil Service position in the [[Privy Council]] office as Inspector for [[National school (England and Wales)|National Schools]] in Wales. This appointment was a result of the uproar that had been created by the publication of the 1847 Welsh [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Blue Book]] on Education. Jones remained a very active member of the association and resumed as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1855. He was succeeded as joint general secretary by the Rev [[Basil Jones]], later to become [[Bishop of St David's]].\n\nMany scholars and academics were involved in the work of the association at this time. These included [[G. T. Clark]], the manager of [[Dowlais Ironworks]] for [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], who was to become a leading authority on [[Castle|British Castles]].<ref>James B Ll.(ed) G.T Clark : Scholar Ironmaster in the Victorian Age. University of Wales Press, Cardiff. 1998. {{ISBN|0-7083-1500-3}}</ref> Clark's first article to be published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1853 was on [[Kidwelly Castle]]. It was accompanied by plans and drawings by a Mrs Trehearne engraved by [[John Henry le Keux]].[[File:Kidwelly Castle plan.jpg|thumb|Kidwelly Castle plan used to illustrate G T Clark's article]] Another figure was the youthful [[Edward Augustus Freeman]],<ref>http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133eaf-p1.shtml#id4243334, This is an extensive catalogue of writing and drawings by Freeman held by the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester. It includes 446 drawings of Welsh architecture and extensive correspondence with Sir Stephen Glynne and other members of the Cambrians.</ref> later celebrated as a medieval historian, and, from 1884, [[Regius Professor of History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at Oxford. Freeman submitted a series of articles on church architecture in Wales and on the domestic architecture of Pembrokeshire. Also in this group was [[John Obadiah Westwood]], a notable Oxford [[entomologist]], whose studies of inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period was to provide a systematic approach to the subject. The Cambrian Archaeological Association was to sponsor the publication of Westwood's ''Lapidarium Walli\u00e6: the early Inscribed and Sculptured Stones of Wales'' in 1876\u20131879.<ref>\"Moore\" pg 28</ref> A final key figure was Rev [[Cardale Babington|Charles Cardale Babington]], who came from [[Ludlow]] in Shropshire. Professor of Botany at Cambridge, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1851. Babington was also interested in archaeology, and joined the General Committee of the association in 1855: he was to chair the committee until 1882.\n\nIn the 1850s a schism developed among the membership of the Cambrians. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]], who had been to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and whose sympathies lay with the Tractarians (or [[Oxford Movement]]), belonged to an older school of celticism, which wished to promote the authenticity of the writings of [[Iolo Morganwg]]. Williams did not fit in with the members of the association, whose primary interests were in Welsh architecture and archaeology. The association was also in a poor state financially as there had been a failure to collect subscriptions. Williams resigned as general secretary and Editor late in 1853<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 5, 1854, p. 71</ref> and he was followed by other joint secretary the Rev Basil Jones who resigned at the Summer Meeting at Ruthin. The published list of members now shows that membership had shrunk to 163. Williams, following his resignation created an alternative society, the Cambrian Institute, publishers of the ''Cambrian Journal'', which Williams edited until his death in 1863, when the Institute faded away.<ref>Lloyd, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===The re-constituted association: 1856\u20131880s===\nFollowing the Ruthin meeting active steps were made to re-establish the association, the objectives were redefined and a new constitution was adopted at the Welshpool Meeting of the association in 1856. For much of this period the General Committee of the association was under the capable chairmanship of [[Cardale Babington]] (from 1864\u201384)<ref>Moore, p. 20.</ref> and the general secretary to the committee was the [[Edward Barwell|Rev E L Barnwell]] (from 1854\u201375).<ref>Moore, p. 25.</ref> At this point the association became more involved in Archaeology, sponsoring through an appeal the Rev David Davies' (their local Secretary for Montgomeryshire) excavations on the Roman auxiliary fort at [[Caersws]] which was published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1857.<ref>D. Davies, \"Caersws: Roman Remains Discovered and Described\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 3rd ser., pp. 151\u2013172.</ref>\n\nLongueville Jones, who was travelling extensively in Wales as part of his duties as inspector of [[National Schools]], now had more time as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. He produced many articles and listings of archaeological sites, which furthered his campaign for the establishment of a Monuments Record and Inspectorate, and anticipated the formation of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|Welsh Royal Commission]] in 1908. E L Barnwell also had a wide range of interests. Between 1855 and 1884 he contributed 102 articles and notes on a wide range of subjects to ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. His main interests were Archaeology, Vernacular Architecture, Medieval History and Genealogy. His last article in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'',  \"On Some South Wales [[Dolmen|Cromlechs]]\", disputed some of the assertions in Ferguson's recently published \"Rude Stone Monuments of all Countries\" and provides an overview of [[Chamber tomb|Chambered Tombs]] in Wales.[[File:Arch Camb Vol 2 1872 21 15.jpeg|thumb|Wigmore Grange by Edward Blore 1872]] Other important publications were by [[William Owen Stanley|Hon W O Stanley]] on his excavation of tumuli in Anglesey and one on [[Wigmore Abbey]] and Monastic Grange in Herefordshire by [[Edward Blore]].  Blore was a leading architect, who had been employed by Queen Victoria to re-build [[Buckingham Palace]] and he was an accomplished topographical artist specialising in later Medieval architecture. His drawings of Wigmore Grange were engraved by John le Keux and are some of the finest topographical prints published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensiis''.<ref>E. Blore, \"Wigmore Abbey\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 4th ser., vol. 2, pp. 207\u2013238.</ref>\n\nThe Cambrians also established a relationship with the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests|\"Office of Woods and Forests\"]] who were responsible for Castles and other monuments belonging to the Crown in Wales. The Cambrians had already influenced [[Anthony Salvin|Salvin's]] restoration of Caernarvon Castle and made a financial contribution towards it. They now inaugurated a scheme whereby the Office would lease Castles and other monuments to members of the association so that they could be preserved and restored.  The [[Edward Barnwell|Rev E L Barnwell]], took up a lease of Denbigh Castle on behalf of the association. Slightly later the monastery of [[Strata Florida]] was leased by the association so that it could be safeguarded and displayed to the public.\n\n===Late Victorian period to the end of the First World War===\nBy the early 1880s few of the original members or the association were still active. Cardale Babbington resigned as chairman of the General Committee in 1884, and was replaced by Archdeacon D R Thomas, who remained as chairman until 1916.  New figures included [[John Rhys]], who had become Professor of Celtic at Oxford in 1877. The emphasis changes slightly with more emphasis on Celtic studies and [[Alfred Neobard Palmer]], who contributed articles on the local history of the Wrexham area and the medieval borough of [[Holt, Wales|Holt]]. The great Welsh historian, Sir[[John Edward Lloyd|J E Lloyd]] joined the association in 1896.  The greatest impact was made by [[John Romilly Allen]] whose family came from [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narbeth]] in Pembrokeshire.  Romilly Allen joined the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became one of two editors of its Journal in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death in 1907.  Romilly Allen was to replace Westwood (who died in 1893) as the acknowledged expert on inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period and his researches in Scotland are even better known than those he undertook in Wales. Romilly Allen campaigned for a Welsh National Museum and wrote scathing criticisms when antiquities were acquired by British Museum; the [[Grosvenor Museum]] in Chester purchased some [[Bronze Age]] Urns from North Wales and particularly when the Late Iron Age [[Trawsfynydd]] Tankard was removed to Liverpool Museum. It was fitting that the [[National Museum of Wales]] was granted its foundation charter in 1907, the year of Romilly Allen's death.\n\nRomilly Allen was also very adverse to what he perceived as other bodies interfering in Welsh matters. In 1886 the Cambrians launched an appeal to sponsor an excavation at [[Strata Florida]]. The [[Cistercian]] Abbey had been taken into 'guardianship' by the association and the intention was to provide a plan of the Abbey and to make it accessible for visitors. The excavation were placed in the hands of [[Stephen W. Williams (architect, civil engineer and archaeologist)|Stephen Williams]] and he started work in June 1887. The excavations did not find favour with [[John William Willis-Bund|J W Willis-Bund]], who was the local secretary of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] for South Wales. Bund denigrated William's work, alleging 'the mischief likely to be done if the excavations were continued without the direction of some competent person'. This was not taken well by the association, but St John Hope, the Assistant Secretary of the Antiquaries gave advice and was able to mediate.<ref>Williams, David Henry (1992). \" An Appreciation of Stephen William Williams, Montgomeryshire Collections, Vol 80, 73\u20134</ref> Later, Romilly Allen, as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', commented that \"the Cambrian Archaeological Association has always shown itself willing to receive advice courteously offered, but it can never admit the contention that the Society of Antiquaries has the right to send its officials to Wales to dictate how explorations should be conducted\".<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 1890, pp. 28\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe association was now becoming more adventurous as far its summer meetings and increasingly started to visit other 'Celtic' lands outside Wales and the [[Marches]]. The first of these visits was to Truro in 1862, followed by the Isle of Man in 1865. More ambitious was the visit to Brittany in 1889 and in 1891 Professor John Rees organised a trip to [[Kerry, Powys|Kerry]] in Ireland. The most ambitious meeting was in 1899 when the association hired a steamer to voyage round the Western Isles of Scotland to visit remote sites and see sculptured stones. The social life on these yearly trips and meetings from 1908 onwards is well described in Evelyn Lewes' book ''Out with the Cambrians'', which was published in 1934<ref>Evelyn Lewes, ''Out with the Cambrians'', Williams and Norgate, London 1934.</ref>\n\nFollowing the death in 1907 of Romilly Allen, the Rev [[Rupert Morris]], originally from [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in Flintshire took over the editorship. Morris had joined the Cambrians in 1875 and in 1892 he had become Chaplain and Librarian to the [[Duke of Westminster]] at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] near Chester.<ref>Obituary: ''Arch. Camb''</ref> Morris immersed himself in the history of Chester, his most notable publication being '' Chester during the Plantagenet and Tudor Reigns '', published in 1894, and he also edited the [[Chester Archaeological Journal]]. He then moved to [[St Gabriel's, Warwick Square|St Gabriel's, Pimlico]], a large London parish in the Duke's [[patronage]]. It was from here that he edited ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' until his death in 1917. With the onset of the First World War the association was able initially to keep up its publication programme, but then reduced the issues of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' to two each year. The summer meetings were abandoned, with a general meeting being called each year at Shrewsbury. Much of the organisation of the association was undertaken by the noted geologist and [[Palaeolithic]] archaeologist [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who had been born at [[Buttington]], near Welshpool. Boyd Dawkins, who was [[knighted]] in 1917, stood in as president of the association between 1914 and 1919.\n\n===1918\u20131950===\nBy the mid-1920s the influence of the recently established National Museum of Wales starts to make its mark on the association. [[Mortimer Wheeler]] was appointed keeper of archaeology in 1922, and in 1924 he became director of the museum. He immediately started on notable excavations on the Roman sites of [[Segontium]]<ref>R.E. Mortimer Wheeler (1924) ''Segontium and the Roman occupation of Wales'' (Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion)</ref> on the outskirts of Caernarvon and [[Brecon Gaer]]. These volumes were published in ''[[Y Cymmrodor]]'', an annual journal of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|Society of Cymmrodorion]] rather than in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', presumably because the Cambrians would not devote a single volume to each excavation.  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was still being published quarterly in a quarto format, which could not be adapted for the publication of excavation reports with large plans. As a result,  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was changed to the larger quarto format in 1928.  'Mortimer Wheeler encouraged non-professional archaeologists, such as the Bangor Architect Harold Hughes and [[Dr Willoughby Gardner]] in their research on [[Hillforts]] of Northern Wales. This research had started in 1909 and in his presidential address to the Cambrians in 1924, Willougby Gardner gives an extensive review of this research, illustrated with plans. They were later to survey [[Ffridd Faldwyn, Montgomery]] near Montgomery.<ref>Willoughby Gardner \"Ffridd Faldwyn Hill Fort, near Montgomery\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 87 (1932), pp. 364\u2013372.</ref> This work was to form the basis for the excavations that followed at Ffridd Faldwyn by [[B. H. St. John O\u2019Neill|St John O'Neill]], the [[Office of Works]] Inspector in Wales. Also Sir [[Cyril Fox]], who succeeded Wheeler as the Director of the National Museum of Wales, published his survey of [[Offa's Dyke]] in parts in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. It was afterwards republished as one volume by the [[British Academy]] in 1955.<ref>Cyril Fox, ''Offa's Dyke: a Field Survey of the Western Frontier Works of Mercia in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries AD'' (London, 1955)</ref>\n\nIn the War Years, from 1939 to 1945, the Cambrians were unable to hold any meetings, but volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' continued to be produced. In 1946, to commemorate the  centenary of the association, the volume for that year was entitled ''100 Years of Welsh Archaeology 1846\u20131956'', which was a masterful survey of the state of knowledge about Welsh Archaeology. In the 1940s the noted church architectural  historian Fred Crossley, together with Maurice Ridgeway, started a detailed county by  county survey of roods screens, lofts and carved woodwork in Welsh Churches.\n\n==Presidents==\nIn the early days of the Cambrian Archaeological Association the position of the president of the society went to a member of the landed gentry or aristocracy in Wales or the [[Welsh Marches]], as well as to Welsh bishops and senior figures in the [[Anglican]] Church. The first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]], the brother-in-law of [[William Gladstone]], a passionate [[ecclesiologist]], who was a guiding figure of the association for many years. The main intention of the presidency was, and still to some extent is, to provide an entree for visits and the organisation of the summer general meeting. It is normal for the presidency to be held for one year, but on some occasions it has been held for longer. Nearly all the early presidents were either clerics in the Anglican Church or had at some time been Members of Parliament. It is very clear that the summer meetings were used as a forum (outside the formal events), for the discussion of matters not directly associated with archaeology or Welsh history. Most notably a number of the presidents were members of the Canterbury Society, an association for the colonisation of the South Island of New Zealand. Also many were directly involved in the railway companies which were opening up Wales at the time, most notably [[George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry|Earl Vane Tempest]], later Lord Londonderry of Machynlleth, president in 1866, who was the chairman of the [[Cambrian Railways]]. This does not imply that the majority of the presidents were uninterested in archaeology. The Earl of Dunraven of Dunraven Castle in Glamorgan, president in 1849 and 1869, while not involved in Welsh archaeology, was a leading Irish intellectual and Celtic scholar, as well as a supporter of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Many of the other presidents who were MPs were leading [[Antiquaries]], particularly [[Octavius Morgan]] and [[Stanley Leighton]] \u2013 the latter was the founding figure of [[SPAB]]. Equally most of the bishops and churchmen, who were presidents, were leading academics. The scholarly Rev Basil Jones, the second secretary of the association, later became the president in 1878, after his elevation to the Bishopric of St David's.\n\nA change starts to appear in 1881, when Professor [[Charles Cardale Babington]] a botanist and archaeologist at [[Cambridge University]], became president. Babington was also chairman of the General Committee of Association for many years. Babington was followed in 1891 by the noted celticist Prof [[John Rhys]] of Oxford, the [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] Rev Prof A H Sayce, also of Oxford. In 1895 and 1896 the renowned legal historian and [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] served twice as president.  The archaeologist and geologist Professor Sir [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who was president for six years and successfully steered the association through the years of the First World War.\n\nAfter the First World War, further changes in the presidency are apparent. Leading archaeologists (Sir) [[Mortimer Wheeler]] (1930) and (Sir) [[Cyril Fox]] (1933); architects: Harold Hughes (1930) and [[W. D. Car\u00f6e]] (1936); historians and celticists [[Sir John Edward Lloyd]](1937) and [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Prof R. A. S. Macalister]] (1932 and 1934), were amongst the presidents. Since the Second World War the presidents have been a mixture of leading academics, professional architects and archaeologists, the occasional [[Anglican]] cleric, and local historians, such as [[John Davies Knatchbull Lloyd|J. D. K. Lloyd]] of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' for many years.  While women such as [[Angharad Llwyd]] had been allowed to join the Cambrians in their own right from an early date, it was not until 1988 that [[Frances Lynch]] became first female president. Since then there have been five further women presidents.\n\n==Annual General Meetings & Summer Conferences, and Presidents==\n{{colbegin}}\n* 1847 Aberystwyth: [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]]\n* 1848 Caernarvon: [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]]\n* 1849 Cardiff: [[Edwin Wyndham-Quin, 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl]] Viscount Adare                \n* 1850 Dolgellau: [[William Watkin Edward Wynne]]                                                  \n* 1851 Tenby: [[John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor]]\n* 1852 Ludlow: Hon [[Robert Clive (1789\u20131854)|Robert Henry Clive]] MP                            \n* 1853 Brecon: [[Sir Joseph Bailey, 1st Baronet]] MP \n* 1854 Ruthin: [[Frederick Richard West]] MP \n* 1855 Llandeilo Fawr: [[George Rice-Trevor, 4th Baron Dynevor]]\n* 1856 Welshpool: [[Edward James Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis]] \n* 1857 Monmouth: [[Octavius Morgan]]\n* 1858 Rhyl: Bishop [[Thomas Vowler Short]] of St Asaph \n* 1859 Cardigan: Bishop [[Connop Thirwall]] of St David's\n* 1860 Bangor: [[Charles Wynne|Charles Griffith Wynne]] later Charles Wynne-Finch\n[[File:Henry Hussey Vivian, Vanity Fair, 1886-06-05.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hussey Vivian]], president 1860\u201362, ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1886]]\n* 1861 Swansea: [[Henry Hussey Vivian]] \n* 1862 Truro: Henry Hussey Vivian\n* 1863 Kington: [[John Walsh, 1st Baron Ormathwaite|Sir John Benn Walsh Bt]] MP \n* 1864 Haverfordwest: [[John Henry Scourfield]]\n* 1865 Douglas, Isle of Man: [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Henry Bougham Loch]] \n* 1866 Machynlleth: [[George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry|George H.

The association's activities include sponsoring lectures, field visits, and study tours; as well as publishing its journal, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', and monographs.  It also provides grants to support research and publications.<ref>M. Stephens, ''The New Companion to the Literature of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 1998), p. 68.</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Meetings and lectures===\nThe association holds two meetings each year, a week in mid-summer and an autumn weekend, visiting sites and monuments in all parts of Wales and, on occasions, in England, Scotland, Ireland and abroad. Easter conferences with lectures on matters of current concern in history and archaeology are held on a bi-annual basis. It arranges a lecture in the [[Welsh language]] each year at the [[National Eisteddfod]].<ref>D.

It was also at the moment that the dominance of the Antiquarian and Welsh learned societies centred in London were on the wane.<ref>Emrys Jones ed. (2001) ''The Welsh in London, 1500\u20132000'', Cardiff: UWP, pp. 69\u201374</ref> There were two earlier learned Welsh Cultural societies in London; the [[Cymmrodorion]] founded in 1751<ref>http://www.cymmrodorion.org/our-history: Prof Prys Morgan, \u201cA Brief History of the Cymmrodorion\u201d- this society was the successor to an earlier society, \u2018The Most Honorable and Loyal Society of Antient Britons\u2019, which had been founded in 1715</ref> and the ''Cymreigyddion'' (who conducted all their business in the Welsh language) founded in 1770.<ref>R.

The premier English antiquarian society, the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], which had received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1745, was also in an impoverished state, having virtually bankrupted itself as the result of publishing ventures.<ref>[[Joan Evans (art historian)|Joan Evans]]\"A History of the Society of Antiquaries\", Oxford, 1956, 258\u201360</ref> In Scotland the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] had been established in Edinburgh in 1780, while in Ireland the [[Royal Irish Academy]], established in 1786, had its own Antiquities Section, and in 1890 the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] had been formed from the Kilkenny Archaeological Society.[[File:Tower , near Mold 1846.jpeg|thumb|Tower, Broncoed, near Mold 1846. Soft Ground etching by Harry Longueville Jones, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', vol. 1 (1846), p. 54]] Against this background the [[British Archaeological Association]] was founded in 1844, and was followed rapidly by a breakaway group, the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]], which pioneered a model of holding annual meetings or congresses in various parts of the British Isles and producing an annual journal (published in quarterly parts). This was the model adopted by Cambrian Archaeological Association for Wales and the Marches.\n\nThe driving figure in the establishment of the Cambrian Archaeological Association was the Rev. [[Harry Longueville Jones]]<ref>Longueville Jones took his name from inheriting the Longueville estates in Shropshire.  Sir Ben Bowen Thomas \"Arch Camb\" 127, apparently erroneously says that his mother came from the French Longueville family, which seems most unlikely as her maiden name was Stephen</ref> who was supported by the celticist the Rev [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]]. Rather than form a society directly, Longueville Jones produced a 'manifesto' -''On the study and preservation of national antiquities''- calling on interested people to join together and form an association.<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol 1.</ref> Longueville Jones at this date was living at [[Beaumaris]] in Anglesey.  Between 1834 and 1842 he lived in Paris, where he worked for the English language publisher [[John Anthony Galignani|Galignani]] and edited several editions of Galignani's Paris Guide.  He worked with leading literary figures including [[William Thackeray]]. The ideas he put forward owed much to current developments in France, which followed the appointment in 1834 of the French novelist [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] as the first Inspector-General of ''Monuments Historiques''.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Fermigier, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e et l'inspection des monuments historiques, dans Pierre Nora (dir.), Les lieux de m\u00e9moire, vol. 1, Paris: Gallimard Quarto, 1997, p. 1599-1614.</ref> Longueville was also a talented artist and his work was used to illustrate early volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''.\n\n===Early years 1847\u20131855===\n[[File:Sir Stephen Glynne 01.jpeg|thumb|left|Sir Stephen Glynne, president 1847/9]]\nThe first annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society was held at Aberystwyth between 7 and 10 September 1847, and the first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Richard Glynne]]. By the time of the second annual meeting at Caernarvon it was claimed that the membership had grown to 350. Initially the association was well supported by members of the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]]. In 1849 [[Harry Longueville Jones]] resigned as joint general secretary on his appointment to the Civil Service position in the [[Privy Council]] office as Inspector for [[National school (England and Wales)|National Schools]] in Wales. This appointment was a result of the uproar that had been created by the publication of the 1847 Welsh [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Blue Book]] on Education. Jones remained a very active member of the association and resumed as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1855. He was succeeded as joint general secretary by the Rev [[Basil Jones]], later to become [[Bishop of St David's]].\n\nMany scholars and academics were involved in the work of the association at this time. These included [[G. T. Clark]], the manager of [[Dowlais Ironworks]] for [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], who was to become a leading authority on [[Castle|British Castles]].<ref>James B Ll.(ed) G.T Clark : Scholar Ironmaster in the Victorian Age. University of Wales Press, Cardiff. 1998. {{ISBN|0-7083-1500-3}}</ref> Clark's first article to be published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1853 was on [[Kidwelly Castle]]. It was accompanied by plans and drawings by a Mrs Trehearne engraved by [[John Henry le Keux]].[[File:Kidwelly Castle plan.jpg|thumb|Kidwelly Castle plan used to illustrate G T Clark's article]] Another figure was the youthful [[Edward Augustus Freeman]],<ref>http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133eaf-p1.shtml#id4243334, This is an extensive catalogue of writing and drawings by Freeman held by the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester. It includes 446 drawings of Welsh architecture and extensive correspondence with Sir Stephen Glynne and other members of the Cambrians.</ref> later celebrated as a medieval historian, and, from 1884, [[Regius Professor of History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at Oxford. Freeman submitted a series of articles on church architecture in Wales and on the domestic architecture of Pembrokeshire. Also in this group was [[John Obadiah Westwood]], a notable Oxford [[entomologist]], whose studies of inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period was to provide a systematic approach to the subject. The Cambrian Archaeological Association was to sponsor the publication of Westwood's ''Lapidarium Walli\u00e6: the early Inscribed and Sculptured Stones of Wales'' in 1876\u20131879.<ref>\"Moore\" pg 28</ref> A final key figure was Rev [[Cardale Babington|Charles Cardale Babington]], who came from [[Ludlow]] in Shropshire. Professor of Botany at Cambridge, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1851. Babington was also interested in archaeology, and joined the General Committee of the association in 1855: he was to chair the committee until 1882.\n\nIn the 1850s a schism developed among the membership of the Cambrians. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]], who had been to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and whose sympathies lay with the Tractarians (or [[Oxford Movement]]), belonged to an older school of celticism, which wished to promote the authenticity of the writings of [[Iolo Morganwg]]. Williams did not fit in with the members of the association, whose primary interests were in Welsh architecture and archaeology. The association was also in a poor state financially as there had been a failure to collect subscriptions. Williams resigned as general secretary and Editor late in 1853<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 5, 1854, p. 71</ref> and he was followed by other joint secretary the Rev Basil Jones who resigned at the Summer Meeting at Ruthin. The published list of members now shows that membership had shrunk to 163. Williams, following his resignation created an alternative society, the Cambrian Institute, publishers of the ''Cambrian Journal'', which Williams edited until his death in 1863, when the Institute faded away.<ref>Lloyd, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===The re-constituted association: 1856\u20131880s===\nFollowing the Ruthin meeting active steps were made to re-establish the association, the objectives were redefined and a new constitution was adopted at the Welshpool Meeting of the association in 1856. For much of this period the General Committee of the association was under the capable chairmanship of [[Cardale Babington]] (from 1864\u201384)<ref>Moore, p. 20.</ref> and the general secretary to the committee was the [[Edward Barwell|Rev E L Barnwell]] (from 1854\u201375).<ref>Moore, p. 25.</ref> At this point the association became more involved in Archaeology, sponsoring through an appeal the Rev David Davies' (their local Secretary for Montgomeryshire) excavations on the Roman auxiliary fort at [[Caersws]] which was published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1857.<ref>D. Davies, \"Caersws: Roman Remains Discovered and Described\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 3rd ser., pp. 151\u2013172.</ref>\n\nLongueville Jones, who was travelling extensively in Wales as part of his duties as inspector of [[National Schools]], now had more time as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. He produced many articles and listings of archaeological sites, which furthered his campaign for the establishment of a Monuments Record and Inspectorate, and anticipated the formation of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|Welsh Royal Commission]] in 1908. E L Barnwell also had a wide range of interests. Between 1855 and 1884 he contributed 102 articles and notes on a wide range of subjects to ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. His main interests were Archaeology, Vernacular Architecture, Medieval History and Genealogy. His last article in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'',  \"On Some South Wales [[Dolmen|Cromlechs]]\", disputed some of the assertions in Ferguson's recently published \"Rude Stone Monuments of all Countries\" and provides an overview of [[Chamber tomb|Chambered Tombs]] in Wales.[[File:Arch Camb Vol 2 1872 21 15.jpeg|thumb|Wigmore Grange by Edward Blore 1872]] Other important publications were by [[William Owen Stanley|Hon W O Stanley]] on his excavation of tumuli in Anglesey and one on [[Wigmore Abbey]] and Monastic Grange in Herefordshire by [[Edward Blore]].  Blore was a leading architect, who had been employed by Queen Victoria to re-build [[Buckingham Palace]] and he was an accomplished topographical artist specialising in later Medieval architecture. His drawings of Wigmore Grange were engraved by John le Keux and are some of the finest topographical prints published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensiis''.<ref>E. Blore, \"Wigmore Abbey\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 4th ser., vol. 2, pp. 207\u2013238.</ref>\n\nThe Cambrians also established a relationship with the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests|\"Office of Woods and Forests\"]] who were responsible for Castles and other monuments belonging to the Crown in Wales. The Cambrians had already influenced [[Anthony Salvin|Salvin's]] restoration of Caernarvon Castle and made a financial contribution towards it. They now inaugurated a scheme whereby the Office would lease Castles and other monuments to members of the association so that they could be preserved and restored.  The [[Edward Barnwell|Rev E L Barnwell]], took up a lease of Denbigh Castle on behalf of the association. Slightly later the monastery of [[Strata Florida]] was leased by the association so that it could be safeguarded and displayed to the public.\n\n===Late Victorian period to the end of the First World War===\nBy the early 1880s few of the original members or the association were still active. Cardale Babbington resigned as chairman of the General Committee in 1884, and was replaced by Archdeacon D R Thomas, who remained as chairman until 1916.  New figures included [[John Rhys]], who had become Professor of Celtic at Oxford in 1877. The emphasis changes slightly with more emphasis on Celtic studies and [[Alfred Neobard Palmer]], who contributed articles on the local history of the Wrexham area and the medieval borough of [[Holt, Wales|Holt]]. The great Welsh historian, Sir[[John Edward Lloyd|J E Lloyd]] joined the association in 1896.  The greatest impact was made by [[John Romilly Allen]] whose family came from [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narbeth]] in Pembrokeshire.  Romilly Allen joined the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became one of two editors of its Journal in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death in 1907.  Romilly Allen was to replace Westwood (who died in 1893) as the acknowledged expert on inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period and his researches in Scotland are even better known than those he undertook in Wales. Romilly Allen campaigned for a Welsh National Museum and wrote scathing criticisms when antiquities were acquired by British Museum; the [[Grosvenor Museum]] in Chester purchased some [[Bronze Age]] Urns from North Wales and particularly when the Late Iron Age [[Trawsfynydd]] Tankard was removed to Liverpool Museum. It was fitting that the [[National Museum of Wales]] was granted its foundation charter in 1907, the year of Romilly Allen's death.\n\nRomilly Allen was also very adverse to what he perceived as other bodies interfering in Welsh matters. In 1886 the Cambrians launched an appeal to sponsor an excavation at [[Strata Florida]]. The [[Cistercian]] Abbey had been taken into 'guardianship' by the association and the intention was to provide a plan of the Abbey and to make it accessible for visitors. The excavation were placed in the hands of [[Stephen W. Williams (architect, civil engineer and archaeologist)|Stephen Williams]] and he started work in June 1887. The excavations did not find favour with [[John William Willis-Bund|J W Willis-Bund]], who was the local secretary of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] for South Wales. Bund denigrated William's work, alleging 'the mischief likely to be done if the excavations were continued without the direction of some competent person'. This was not taken well by the association, but St John Hope, the Assistant Secretary of the Antiquaries gave advice and was able to mediate.<ref>Williams, David Henry (1992). \" An Appreciation of Stephen William Williams, Montgomeryshire Collections, Vol 80, 73\u20134</ref> Later, Romilly Allen, as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', commented that \"the Cambrian Archaeological Association has always shown itself willing to receive advice courteously offered, but it can never admit the contention that the Society of Antiquaries has the right to send its officials to Wales to dictate how explorations should be conducted\".<ref>''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 1890, pp. 28\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe association was now becoming more adventurous as far its summer meetings and increasingly started to visit other 'Celtic' lands outside Wales and the [[Marches]]. The first of these visits was to Truro in 1862, followed by the Isle of Man in 1865. More ambitious was the visit to Brittany in 1889 and in 1891 Professor John Rees organised a trip to [[Kerry, Powys|Kerry]] in Ireland. The most ambitious meeting was in 1899 when the association hired a steamer to voyage round the Western Isles of Scotland to visit remote sites and see sculptured stones. The social life on these yearly trips and meetings from 1908 onwards is well described in Evelyn Lewes' book ''Out with the Cambrians'', which was published in 1934<ref>Evelyn Lewes, ''Out with the Cambrians'', Williams and Norgate, London 1934.</ref>\n\nFollowing the death in 1907 of Romilly Allen, the Rev [[Rupert Morris]], originally from [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in Flintshire took over the editorship. Morris had joined the Cambrians in 1875 and in 1892 he had become Chaplain and Librarian to the [[Duke of Westminster]] at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] near Chester.<ref>Obituary: ''Arch. Camb''</ref> Morris immersed himself in the history of Chester, his most notable publication being '' Chester during the Plantagenet and Tudor Reigns '', published in 1894, and he also edited the [[Chester Archaeological Journal]]. He then moved to [[St Gabriel's, Warwick Square|St Gabriel's, Pimlico]], a large London parish in the Duke's [[patronage]]. It was from here that he edited ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' until his death in 1917. With the onset of the First World War the association was able initially to keep up its publication programme, but then reduced the issues of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' to two each year. The summer meetings were abandoned, with a general meeting being called each year at Shrewsbury. Much of the organisation of the association was undertaken by the noted geologist and [[Palaeolithic]] archaeologist [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who had been born at [[Buttington]], near Welshpool. Boyd Dawkins, who was [[knighted]] in 1917, stood in as president of the association between 1914 and 1919.\n\n===1918\u20131950===\nBy the mid-1920s the influence of the recently established National Museum of Wales starts to make its mark on the association. [[Mortimer Wheeler]] was appointed keeper of archaeology in 1922, and in 1924 he became director of the museum. He immediately started on notable excavations on the Roman sites of [[Segontium]]<ref>R.E. Mortimer Wheeler (1924) ''Segontium and the Roman occupation of Wales'' (Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion)</ref> on the outskirts of Caernarvon and [[Brecon Gaer]]. These volumes were published in ''[[Y Cymmrodor]]'', an annual journal of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|Society of Cymmrodorion]] rather than in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', presumably because the Cambrians would not devote a single volume to each excavation.  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was still being published quarterly in a quarto format, which could not be adapted for the publication of excavation reports with large plans. As a result,  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was changed to the larger quarto format in 1928.  'Mortimer Wheeler encouraged non-professional archaeologists, such as the Bangor Architect Harold Hughes and [[Dr Willoughby Gardner]] in their research on [[Hillforts]] of Northern Wales. This research had started in 1909 and in his presidential address to the Cambrians in 1924, Willougby Gardner gives an extensive review of this research, illustrated with plans. They were later to survey [[Ffridd Faldwyn, Montgomery]] near Montgomery.<ref>Willoughby Gardner \"Ffridd Faldwyn Hill Fort, near Montgomery\", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 87 (1932), pp. 364\u2013372.</ref> This work was to form the basis for the excavations that followed at Ffridd Faldwyn by [[B. H. St. John O\u2019Neill|St John O'Neill]], the [[Office of Works]] Inspector in Wales. Also Sir [[Cyril Fox]], who succeeded Wheeler as the Director of the National Museum of Wales, published his survey of [[Offa's Dyke]] in parts in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. It was afterwards republished as one volume by the [[British Academy]] in 1955.<ref>Cyril Fox, ''Offa's Dyke: a Field Survey of the Western Frontier Works of Mercia in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries AD'' (London, 1955)</ref>\n\nIn the War Years, from 1939 to 1945, the Cambrians were unable to hold any meetings, but volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' continued to be produced. In 1946, to commemorate the  centenary of the association, the volume for that year was entitled ''100 Years of Welsh Archaeology 1846\u20131956'', which was a masterful survey of the state of knowledge about Welsh Archaeology. In the 1940s the noted church architectural  historian Fred Crossley, together with Maurice Ridgeway, started a detailed county by  county survey of roods screens, lofts and carved woodwork in Welsh Churches.\n\n==Presidents==\nIn the early days of the Cambrian Archaeological Association the position of the president of the society went to a member of the landed gentry or aristocracy in Wales or the [[Welsh Marches]], as well as to Welsh bishops and senior figures in the [[Anglican]] Church. The first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]], the brother-in-law of [[William Gladstone]], a passionate [[ecclesiologist]], who was a guiding figure of the association for many years. The main intention of the presidency was, and still to some extent is, to provide an entree for visits and the organisation of the summer general meeting. It is normal for the presidency to be held for one year, but on some occasions it has been held for longer. Nearly all the early presidents were either clerics in the Anglican Church or had at some time been Members of Parliament. It is very clear that the summer meetings were used as a forum (outside the formal events), for the discussion of matters not directly associated with archaeology or Welsh history. Most notably a number of the presidents were members of the Canterbury Society, an association for the colonisation of the South Island of New Zealand. Also many were directly involved in the railway companies which were opening up Wales at the time, most notably [[George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry|Earl Vane Tempest]], later Lord Londonderry of Machynlleth, president in 1866, who was the chairman of the [[Cambrian Railways]]. This does not imply that the majority of the presidents were uninterested in archaeology. The Earl of Dunraven of Dunraven Castle in Glamorgan, president in 1849 and 1869, while not involved in Welsh archaeology, was a leading Irish intellectual and Celtic scholar, as well as a supporter of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Many of the other presidents who were MPs were leading [[Antiquaries]], particularly [[Octavius Morgan]] and [[Stanley Leighton]] \u2013 the latter was the founding figure of [[SPAB]]. Equally most of the bishops and churchmen, who were presidents, were leading academics. The scholarly Rev Basil Jones, the second secretary of the association, later became the president in 1878, after his elevation to the Bishopric of St David's.\n\nA change starts to appear in 1881, when Professor [[Charles Cardale Babington]] a botanist and archaeologist at [[Cambridge University]], became president. Babington was also chairman of the General Committee of Association for many years. Babington was followed in 1891 by the noted celticist Prof [[John Rhys]] of Oxford, the [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] Rev Prof A H Sayce, also of Oxford. In 1895 and 1896 the renowned legal historian and [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] served twice as president.  The archaeologist and geologist Professor Sir [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who was president for six years and successfully steered the association through the years of the First World War.\n\nAfter the First World War, further changes in the presidency are apparent. Leading archaeologists (Sir) [[Mortimer Wheeler]] (1930) and (Sir) [[Cyril Fox]] (1933); architects: Harold Hughes (1930) and [[W. D. Car\u00f6e]] (1936); historians and celticists [[Sir John Edward Lloyd]](1937) and [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Prof R. A. S. Macalister]] (1932 and 1934), were amongst the presidents. Since the Second World War the presidents have been a mixture of leading academics, professional architects and archaeologists, the occasional [[Anglican]] cleric, and local historians, such as [[John Davies Knatchbull Lloyd|J. D. K. Lloyd]] of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' for many years.  While women such as [[Angharad Llwyd]] had been allowed to join the Cambrians in their own right from an early date, it was not until 1988 that [[Frances Lynch]] became first female president. Since then there have been five further women presidents.\n\n==Annual General Meetings & Summer Conferences, and Presidents==\n{{colbegin}}\n* 1847 Aberystwyth: [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]]\n* 1848 Caernarvon: [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]]\n* 1849 Cardiff: [[Edwin Wyndham-Quin, 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl]] Viscount Adare                \n* 1850 Dolgellau: [[William Watkin Edward Wynne]]                                                  \n* 1851 Tenby: [[John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor]]\n* 1852 Ludlow: Hon [[Robert Clive (1789\u20131854)|Robert Henry Clive]] MP                            \n* 1853 Brecon: [[Sir Joseph Bailey, 1st Baronet]] MP \n* 1854 Ruthin: [[Frederick Richard West]] MP \n* 1855 Llandeilo Fawr: [[George Rice-Trevor, 4th Baron Dynevor]]\n* 1856 Welshpool: [[Edward James Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis]] \n* 1857 Monmouth: [[Octavius Morgan]]\n* 1858 Rhyl: Bishop [[Thomas Vowler Short]] of St Asaph \n* 1859 Cardigan: Bishop [[Connop Thirwall]] of St David's\n* 1860 Bangor: [[Charles Wynne|Charles Griffith Wynne]] later Charles Wynne-Finch\n[[File:Henry Hussey Vivian, Vanity Fair, 1886-06-05.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hussey Vivian]], president 1860\u201362, ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1886]]\n* 1861 Swansea: [[Henry Hussey Vivian]] \n* 1862 Truro: Henry Hussey Vivian\n* 1863 Kington: [[John Walsh, 1st Baron Ormathwaite|Sir John Benn Walsh Bt]] MP \n* 1864 Haverfordwest: [[John Henry Scourfield]]\n* 1865 Douglas, Isle of Man: [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Henry Bougham Loch]] \n* 1866 Machynlleth: [[George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry|George H.
