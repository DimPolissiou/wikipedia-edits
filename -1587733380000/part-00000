Three men were sent to prison for the murder, and two remain on [[death row]]. Dunn, two days after his 18th birthday, became the head of his family and raised his siblings. Dunn met with one of the convicted men at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in 2007, and offered his forgiveness.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/12/16/Bucs/Confronting_his_pain.shtml\n|title=Confronting his pain\n|author=Gary Shelton\n|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]\n|date=December 16, 2007\n|accessdate=December 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nDunn played college football at [[Florida State University]], where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in 3 straight seasons.

The HFTH program rewards single-parent families for reaching first-time homeownership. HFTH recipient families are chosen through a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] affiliates and WDC with complete home furnishings and down-payment assistance. As of July 2012, HFTH has assisted over 150 single parents and over 300 dependents in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Tampa and Tallahassee. By providing families with a positive home environment, WDC believes that children can thrive educationally, socially and economically. In 2006, one of those homes happened to go to [[Deshaun Watson|Deshaun Watson's]] family. Watson went on to play quarterback for [[Clemson University|Clemson]] and win the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|URL=http://www.thefalcoholic.com/2017/1/10/14223324/former-falcons-rb-warrick-dunn-donated-house-to-deshaun-watsons| title=Former Falcon's RB Warrick Dunn donated house to DeShaun Watson's family| accessdate=January 12, 2017| website=thefalcoholic.com| author=Matthew Chambers| date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> He currently plays for the [[Houston Texans]].\n\nDunn's achievements have been recognized over the years. He received a Giant Steps Award in civic leadership from former President Bill Clinton for his program. In 2005, Dunn was presented with the [[Walter Payton]] Man of the Year Award. This award is the only NFL award that recognizes a player for his community service as well as for his excellence on the field. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Dunn challenged all NFL players, except for those who play for the New Orleans Saints, to donate at least $5,000 to the effort. The effort received over $5 million in contributions.\n\nIn 2007, Dunn, along with [[Andre Agassi]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Andrea Jaeger]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]], founded [[Athletes for Hope]], a charitable organization that helps professional athletes, sports industry professionals and fans get involved in charitable causes.\nFor his exceptional involvement on and off the field, Dunn was awarded with the 2009 Bart Starr Award.

He gets on well with the family; however, with Agnes, this is a different matter altogether. The two have a deep rivalry, and are sometimes quite horrible to each other, examples of which include: Agnes forcing Grandad to sing a Western song and hitting him with a tray, Grandad trapping Agnes behind the Christmas tree, Agnes trying to get rid of Grandad for two weeks and Grandad referring to her as \"The Twat\".\n\nDespite their animosity to each other, Agnes and Grandad have been shown to genuinely care for each other, even if they conceal it very well. On Valentine's Day, Grandad gave flowers to Agnes and admitted that he thought his son was foolish for taking Agnes for granted. On another occasion, when Grandad was to go to the hospital for tests, Grandad admitted to Agnes that he was afraid, prompting Agnes to give him a pep talk to boost his spirits.\n\nWhen the Brown children were growing up, Grandad played a small role in their lives. He would take them on a walk to the betting shop where he would spend the day. He still looks out for the children, but not as much. Bono enjoys playing (or in his view, tormenting) with him. Grandad has long white hair and is most often found in his armchair, sleeping. In [[World War Two]], he was part of the bomb squad. His wife's name has not been mentioned.\n\nGrandad also features in ''All Round to Mrs. Brown's'' where he is normally seen sleeping in his chair whilst Agnes and Cathy interview guests. He was absent from Series 4 due to his portrayer Dermot O'Neill being unable to attend filming due to receiving treatment for cancer.<ref>https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/mrs-browns-boys-star-dermot-21899666</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mark Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Mark Brown\n|portrayer=Pat 'Pepsi' Shields \n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 28 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1964\n|occupation = Carpenter\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Rory Brown|Rory Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|wife = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Betty Brown|Betty Brown]] (2004\u2013)\n|sons = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Mark Brown''' is the eldest Brown child, husband to Betty and father to Bono.\n\nMark became head of the family aged twenty-six, when his father suddenly died. He is the quietest too, often coaxed into things by his wife. He was born on his parents' wedding day; Agnes's waters broke just after the couple said 'I do'. He was offered a promotion at work, but turned it down. The subsequent result was that Betty kicked him out and he turned up at his mother's house, depressed and tired. He turned down the job because, despite attending school for eight years and not missing a single day, he did not learn to read or write. Agnes, feeling guilty, blamed herself until Cathy pointed out that if in eight years he failed to learn, it was the teachers fault. The problem is resolved when Betty says that she is determined to teach him.\n\nLater on, there was no work going in the carpenter world, and Mark was made redundant. He and Betty had no other choice than to up sticks to Australia. Mark was reluctant to tell his mother, but Betty forced him to. Although putting on a brave face, it mortified Agnes, who sat silent for the rest of the day. The visas for the three came through, and Agnes found it even harder. However, Betty asked Cathy to print something at work for her. Cathy did so and soon, Mark found himself with more work than he could handle. The sheets that were photocopied turned out to be leaflets, which Betty posted through letterboxes. The family didn't emigrate to Australia, and the couple let their son Bono \u2013 Agnes's favourite relative \u2013 break the good news.\n\nMark and Betty are much more well-off than the other family members.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rory Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Rory Brown\n|portrayer=[[Rory Cowan]] (2011\u20132017)<br>Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields (2017 tour)<br>Damien McKiernan (2017\u2013)\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1965\n|occupation = Hairdresser\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|husband = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dino Doyle|Dino Doyle]] (2013\u2013)\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Mark Brown|Mark Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]<br>John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Rory Brown''' is the third son of the Brown family.\n\nRory Brown is the only homosexual in the family, a fact acknowledged by all of his family members except his mother, who seemed completely oblivious to the fact until she realises this with Cathy's intervention in \"Mammy of the Groom\". Rory is not married, up until the end of Season 3, when he marries fellow hairdresser Dino Doyle, in a private ceremony.\n\nHis sexuality is hinted at in \"Mammy's Secret\" when Rory tries to tell Agnes in Foley's; however, he is unable to do so. It is also hinted at later on in that episode when Agnes is having a discussion with Cathy and she says that Rory wants to tell her something, but is afraid that it will hurt her. This is also hinted at even more when the family is discussing who is coming to Dermot and Maria's wedding, when Rory said that he won't be bringing a girl. Rory was also apparently caught wearing his sister's communion dress when he was about 10.\n\nAgnes is the only character not to know about his homosexuality up until \"Mammy of the Groom\" where she describes it as an illness. Until then, she was completely unaware of this and even Agnes' best friend, Winnie McGoogan, knew that Rory was homosexual.\n\nRory is one of two of Agnes's children to wear glasses, the other being Trevor.\n\n[[Rory Cowan]] quit the role in July 2017 after 26 years of playing the character both on screen and in theatre, stating that he had not been happy for two years, although he did not state the reason behind it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/rory-cowan-leaves-mrs-browns-boys-after-26-years-i-hadnt-been-happy-for-two-years/ar-BBE7wQR?li=AAnZ9Ug&ocid=mailsignout&#93;# |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713063647/http://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/rory-cowan-leaves-mrs-browns-boys-after-26-years-i-hadnt-been-happy-for-two-years/ar-BBE7wQR?li=AAnZ9Ug# |archive-date=13 July 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced that the character would be replaced and would be revealed on the 2017 Christmas Day special.<ref>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/brendan-ocarroll-announces-rory-cowans-mrs-browns-boys-replacement-35930519.html</ref> During the 2017 live tour for the November \u2013 December shows the role was played by other cast member Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields.

He was very nearly not home for one Christmas, much to Agnes's dismay (everyone else knew). However, in the middle of the party, Trevor walks through the door and Agnes bursts into tears, overjoyed. When he leaves for the missions in Series Two, he tells his mother that he doesn't want a big fuss like last time, his exact words being \"no cake, no decorations, no brass band and please, Mammy, ''no tears''\". Agnes disobeys him and orders everything. Another Christmas time, Agnes is reading the letters her children sent to [[Father Christmas]], and reads Trevor's. Trevor asks for his presents to be given to a poor boy with no toys.\n\nTrevor has since appeared sporadically throughout the series. He appears for his brother Rory's wedding, and has a minor role in [[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie|the movie]], but is never a major character and all his traveling conflicts with his work on the missions.

In the second episode of Series 4, Trevor announced to Agnes that he wasn't returning to the missions after seeing what the world was like now and stated that if God had wanted him to stay, he would have given him a sign. Near the end of the episode, Trevor's faith was restored when he woke up and noticed \"blood\" markings on the palms of his hands, which he took as a sign from God. Unbeknownst to Trevor, Agnes had painted the markings on with red paint given to her by Betty.\n\nTrevor is portrayed by Paddy Houlihan (who plays Dermot in the BBC series) in the original series and O'Carroll's real-life son-in-law, Martin Delany, and is the real-life husband of Fiona O'Carroll (Maria Brown) in the BBC series.<ref name=\"autogenerated\"/> Martin is also one of the producers of the series, working for O'Carroll's own production company [[BOC-PIX]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Betty Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Betty Brown\n|portrayer=Amanda Woods\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = [[Donegal]]\n|occupation = Housewife\n|husband = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Mark Brown|Mark Brown]]\n|sons = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Elizabeth \"Betty\" Brown''' is Mark's wife and the mother of Bono.\n\nBetty and Agnes have a love/hate relationship.

She does not like snakes.\n\nWhen Mark, Betty, and Bono were thinking of moving to Australia, Betty was keener to move than her husband and son.

Her mother Hilary is a snob and dislikes Agnes intensely. Maria loves the family though, and she and Dermot live with Agnes until they find their own place. Maria was more desperate to find a house than Dermot was, as she did not enjoy the cramped atmosphere.

He also occasionally wears costumes, similar to what Dermot wears, when he helps him at work.\n\nBuster often comes up with scams and wheezes to earn money or to gain something for his own benefit, often roping Dermot in as an accomplice. He is very much disliked by Mrs Brown who sees him as a bad influence on Dermot; however she occasionally warms to him, such as when she lets him stay for a family Christmas dinner as he had no close family of his own to spend it with, and again at New Year. She also recognises that he is genuinely Dermot's friend and cares about Dermot. Agnes states this when Maria will not allow him to be Dermot's best man.\nBuster himself seems very fond of Mrs Brown, seemingly oblivious to her dislike for him.\n\nBuster is somewhat unintelligent, and frequently says stupid or irritating things with little regard for how others will react. However, he has on several occasions displayed a certain amount of cunning; for example, when he and Dermot were competing for a contract against another promotion company, Buster sabotaged their rivals by stealing their boxes of flyers and replacing them with Dermot and Buster's flyers, ultimately resulting in Dermot and Buster being awarded the contract.\n\nIt is unknown if Buster is related to Sadie Brady, at whose party Agnes and Redser met. In \"Mammy's Widow Memories\", Buster says that his birth year is 1988 which would make him either 31 or 32.\n\nBuster is in love with Cathy, as shown in several episodes; this is normally played for laughs with him either being inappropriate or outright rejected. However, in the episode \"Mammy's Gamble\", he learned that Cathy was planning to attempt to conceive via artificial insemination and offered to marry her to give her a child, and a father for the child, saying he'd always loved her. Cathy was actually touched and whilst she said no and that she didn't love him, she said it was the weirdest and sweetest proposal she'd ever had.\n\nIn \"Mammy's Hotel\", Buster meets his son Blister.\n\nBuster is portrayed by O'Carroll's real-life son, Danny O'Carroll, and is the real-life husband of Amanda Woods (Betty Brown) and father of Jamie (Bono Brown) and Blake O'Carroll (Blister Brady).<ref name=\"autogenerated\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Hillary Nicholson===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Hillary Nicholson\n|portrayer= [[Sorcha Cusack]] <small>(2011)</small><br>[[Susie Blake]] <small>(2011\u2013)</small>\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132015, 2017\u2013\n|first= 28 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = England\n|occupation = Housewife<br>secretary of the school board\n|father = John Sheridan\n|sisters = Mary Sheridan\n|husband = Sinbad Nicholson (original series)<br>Johnathan Nicholson\n|daughters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Maria Brown|Maria Brown]]\n|nephews = Thomas Clowne\n|nieces = Bethany\n|grandsons = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n}}\n\n'''Hillary Nicholson''' (n\u00e9e '''Sheridan''') is the snobbish mother of Maria and the maternal grandmother of the Brown triplets.\n\nDespite her rich background, her great-grandfather made a living by pushing a cart of dead dogs around the streets. Bar Dermot, Hillary looks down on the Brown family at first but is gradually getting used to them and their surroundings. She is very protective of her daughter, and when planning Dermot and Maria's wedding, thinks of relocating the ceremony to Italy. However, she changes her mind when Agnes reminds her that her father, John, was the vicar at St. Jarleth's Church \u2013 and he hasn't been seen since the money from the collection disappeared.

He also gave Agnes her wish to have Grandad tested for mental problems, for him to be put in a home while she goes to the [[Galway Races]].\n\nDr. Flynn is shown to have a minor romantic interest in Cathy. He also became self-appointed Head Judge of the judging panel of Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition, and abused his position by giving the prize (two tickets to go see the Finglas Warriors football team in the finals) to his aunt, Sheila.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Damien===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Damien\n|portrayer=Conor Moloney\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2012\u2013\n|first= 24 December 2012\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Damien''' is the current priest of the local parish in [[Finglas]].\n\nFather Damien is first seen when Hillary introduces him to Agnes after he comes to Finglas to replace Father Quinn. He is strong to protest against Agnes' play version of [[Nativity of Jesus|the Nativity]]. However, he gives in and gets permission from the Bishop once Agnes gets him to make amends with his own mother over the phone. He baptizes the Brown triplets and later visits Agnes, but accidentally causes her to act-up after he accidentally says one of the hypnosis words that turns her into a stripper (as the hypnotist at the baptism party didn't completely remove the hypnosis from her). When Rory and Dino are getting married, he tells Agnes (despite her protests) that he cannot bless them as the Church is against same-sex marriage. But he later shows up at the Brown house to celebrate their marriage as he personally is happy to celebrate all forms of love.\n\nFather Damien also appears in ''All Round to Mrs Brown's'', where he along with Trevor, hosts a segment called \"Thought for the Day\". In a rather marked contrast to his series self, Father Damien is shown here to be rather childish, often providing non-sequiturs and rather humorous lines to the segment, with Trevor serving as the \"straight man\" in the act.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Quinn===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Quinn\n|portrayer=Gary Lilburn\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132013\n|first= 14 March 2011\n|last= 28 January 2013\n|classification = Former; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Quinn''' is the former priest of the local parish in Finglas.\n\nFather Quinn is first seen when Agnes and Winnie crash the funeral party of Paddy Murphy, believing that it's where Maria's hen party is. He comforts Murphy's widow as Agnes and Winnie leave embarrassed. He begins to lose faith and turns to alcohol when a group of [[Mormons]] begin converting locals. In 2012, he leaves Finglas to go to rehab, at which point, Father Damien replaces him. After returning from rehab, he is quick to drink again after having seen Agnes again, who offers him a bottle, together with an incident involving Dermot's mobile phone, which she believes is stolen and hiding it in her bloomers; unfortunately, Buster rings it, causing Agnes to go crazy.

Later, he comes to blows with Agnes over the issue of whether Bono will be attending the notorious local school, St Stephen's. Mark and Betty want Bono to go to school outside the parish, and Agnes, fearful of Bono getting bullied if he goes to St Stephen's, agrees with them, but Father McBride refuses to sign the form to allow it to happen, saying that too many good children are leaving the parish. However, Lulu quickly makes him change his mind, after she says \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it Father McBride?\", \"Who's for a ride on Father McBride?\" and \"Ooh, that's a big one!\". Fearful of his reputation, Father McBride asks to take care of Lulu. Agnes agrees, but only if he will sign the form; he reluctantly agrees.\n\nFather McBride reappears in [[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie|the movie]], officiating at the funeral for Mary Moccasin. After a four-year absence from the screen, McBride returned, in the 2018 Christmas special \"Exotic Mammy\", as one of the three judges, alongside Hillary Nicholson and Dr. Flynn, in Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition.

The two have a deep rivalry, and are sometimes quite horrible to each other, examples of which include: Agnes forcing Grandad to sing a Western song and hitting him with a tray, Grandad trapping Agnes behind the Christmas tree, Agnes trying to get rid of Grandad for two weeks and Grandad referring to her as \"The Twat\".\n\nDespite their animosity to each other, Agnes and Grandad have been shown to genuinely care for each other, even if they conceal it very well. On Valentine's Day, Grandad gave flowers to Agnes and admitted that he thought his son was foolish for taking Agnes for granted. On another occasion, when Grandad was to go to the hospital for tests, Grandad admitted to Agnes that he was afraid, prompting Agnes to give him a pep talk to boost his spirits.\n\nWhen the Brown children were growing up, Grandad played a small role in their lives. He would take them on a walk to the betting shop where he would spend the day. He still looks out for the children, but not as much. Bono enjoys playing (or in his view, tormenting) with him. Grandad has long white hair and is most often found in his armchair, sleeping. In [[World War Two]], he was part of the bomb squad. His wife's name has not been mentioned.\n\nGrandad also features in ''All Round to Mrs. Brown's'' where he is normally seen sleeping in his chair whilst Agnes and Cathy interview guests.

He is the quietest too, often coaxed into things by his wife. He was born on his parents' wedding day; Agnes's waters broke just after the couple said 'I do'. He was offered a promotion at work, but turned it down. The subsequent result was that Betty kicked him out and he turned up at his mother's house, depressed and tired. He turned down the job because, despite attending school for eight years and not missing a single day, he did not learn to read or write. Agnes, feeling guilty, blamed herself until Cathy pointed out that if in eight years he failed to learn, it was the teachers fault. The problem is resolved when Betty says that she is determined to teach him.\n\nLater on, there was no work going in the carpenter world, and Mark was made redundant. He and Betty had no other choice than to up sticks to Australia. Mark was reluctant to tell his mother, but Betty forced him to. Although putting on a brave face, it mortified Agnes, who sat silent for the rest of the day. The visas for the three came through, and Agnes found it even harder. However, Betty asked Cathy to print something at work for her. Cathy did so and soon, Mark found himself with more work than he could handle. The sheets that were photocopied turned out to be leaflets, which Betty posted through letterboxes. The family didn't emigrate to Australia, and the couple let their son Bono \u2013 Agnes's favourite relative \u2013 break the good news.\n\nMark and Betty are much more well-off than the other family members.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rory Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Rory Brown\n|portrayer=[[Rory Cowan]] (2011\u20132017)<br>Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields (2017 tour)<br>Damien McKiernan (2017\u2013)\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1965\n|occupation = Hairdresser\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|husband = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dino Doyle|Dino Doyle]] (2013\u2013)\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Mark Brown|Mark Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]<br>John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Rory Brown''' is the third son of the Brown family.\n\nRory Brown is the only homosexual in the family, a fact acknowledged by all of his family members except his mother, who seemed completely oblivious to the fact until she realises this with Cathy's intervention in \"Mammy of the Groom\".

It is also hinted at later on in that episode when Agnes is having a discussion with Cathy and she says that Rory wants to tell her something, but is afraid that it will hurt her.

He was very nearly not home for one Christmas, much to Agnes's dismay (everyone else knew). However, in the middle of the party, Trevor walks through the door and Agnes bursts into tears, overjoyed. When he leaves for the missions in Series Two, he tells his mother that he doesn't want a big fuss like last time, his exact words being \"no cake, no decorations, no brass band and please, Mammy, ''no tears''\". Agnes disobeys him and orders everything. Another Christmas time, Agnes is reading the letters her children sent to [[Father Christmas]], and reads Trevor's. Trevor asks for his presents to be given to a poor boy with no toys.\n\nTrevor has since appeared sporadically throughout the series.

Her mother Hilary is a snob and dislikes Agnes intensely. Maria loves the family though, and she and Dermot live with Agnes until they find their own place. Maria was more desperate to find a house than Dermot was, as she did not enjoy the cramped atmosphere.

A nurse by profession, Maria spends her nights at Foley's with Agnes, Winnie, Cathy, and Betty.

When one man shouted that it was a giraffe, Sharon shrugged and said that it was close enough. The man sat down, not as eager. Agnes hints that Sharon has had many affairs with married men. She speaks four languages.\n\nSharon is portrayed by O'Carroll's real-life sister-in-law, Fiona Gibney, the real-life sister of [[Jennifer Gibney]] (Cathy Brown).<ref name=\"autogenerated\"/> Fiona is also one of the producers of the series, working for O'Carroll's own production company [[BOC-PIX]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Cathy's boyfriends==\n\n===Mick O'Leary===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Mick O'Leary\n|portrayer=[[Mark Dymond]]\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132013\n|first= 7 March 2011\n|last= 30 December 2013\n|classification = Former; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Policeman\n|father = Mr O'Leary\n|mother = Mrs O'Leary\n}}\n\n'''Detective Michael \"Mick\" O'Leary''' is the former boyfriend of [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]].\n\nMick first appears in the episode Mammy's Merchandise in Series 1 and appeared in the first two episodes of Series 2 until the episode \"Mammy's Coming!\" when [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Maria Brown|Maria Brown]] reveals that he is married, Cathy breaks up with him and Agnes tells him to 'Fuck Off'.\n\nHe is not seen again until Series 3 in the episode Mammy? when he returns on Cathy's doorstep and explains that he was divorced but Cathy and Agnes never gave him the chance to explain. The pair reunite but it doesn't last long as in the New Years' episode \"Who's A Pretty Mammy?\", Mick says he has to go on a job with work.

One good example of this is when he was calling Sharon \"Servant Woman\" and barking orders at Cathy constantly.   Sharon stated that his personality had nothing to do with him being French as she has met many nice Frenchmen before.  Agnes describes him as having \"the personality of a speed bump\". He calls Cathy 'Kitty' every time he addresses her, which annoys Agnes; it annoys her even more when he announces to Cathy that her family is disgraceful and that he will not put up with their camaraderie anymore, and even more so when he says that Agnes is \"lower class than an Olive Farmer's Concubine\". This prompts Agnes to headbutt him, which annoys him to the point where he calls her \"a camel's scrotum\", which prompts Cathy to kick him in the groin area and dump him.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Others==\n\n===Buster Brady===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Buster Brady\n|portrayer=Danny O'Carroll\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 7 March 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=1988\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Career criminal\n|father = Unnamed father\n|mother = Unnamed mother\n|sons = Blister Brady\n|grandparents = Unnamed grandparents (deceased)\n|relatives = Sadie Brady (possible relative)<br>\n}}\n\n'''Buster Brady''' is the [[breakout character]] in Mrs. Brown and Dermot's criminal best friend.\n\nBuster almost never budges from his regular outfit, consisting of a baseball cap, a jacket (he wears three or four different jackets), tracksuit bottoms, and white trainers, exceptions including when he wore his Best Man's suit for Dermot and Maria's wedding, although he was still wearing his cap and trainers, and when he played the angel in the Nativity in The Virgin Mammy for which he wore a white cap. Buster's jacket and trousers both have security tags attached, implying they are stolen, and he almost never wears his cap backwards, except only briefly in series 3 episode 6 \"Mammy Swings!\" when he tried to get a sneak peek at Agnes's new kitchen. He also occasionally wears costumes, similar to what Dermot wears, when he helps him at work.\n\nBuster often comes up with scams and wheezes to earn money or to gain something for his own benefit, often roping Dermot in as an accomplice. He is very much disliked by Mrs Brown who sees him as a bad influence on Dermot; however she occasionally warms to him, such as when she lets him stay for a family Christmas dinner as he had no close family of his own to spend it with, and again at New Year. She also recognises that he is genuinely Dermot's friend and cares about Dermot. Agnes states this when Maria will not allow him to be Dermot's best man.\nBuster himself seems very fond of Mrs Brown, seemingly oblivious to her dislike for him.\n\nBuster is somewhat unintelligent, and frequently says stupid or irritating things with little regard for how others will react. However, he has on several occasions displayed a certain amount of cunning; for example, when he and Dermot were competing for a contract against another promotion company, Buster sabotaged their rivals by stealing their boxes of flyers and replacing them with Dermot and Buster's flyers, ultimately resulting in Dermot and Buster being awarded the contract.\n\nIt is unknown if Buster is related to Sadie Brady, at whose party Agnes and Redser met. In \"Mammy's Widow Memories\", Buster says that his birth year is 1988 which would make him either 31 or 32.\n\nBuster is in love with Cathy, as shown in several episodes; this is normally played for laughs with him either being inappropriate or outright rejected. However, in the episode \"Mammy's Gamble\", he learned that Cathy was planning to attempt to conceive via artificial insemination and offered to marry her to give her a child, and a father for the child, saying he'd always loved her. Cathy was actually touched and whilst she said no and that she didn't love him, she said it was the weirdest and sweetest proposal she'd ever had.\n\nIn \"Mammy's Hotel\", Buster meets his son Blister.\n\nBuster is portrayed by O'Carroll's real-life son, Danny O'Carroll, and is the real-life husband of Amanda Woods (Betty Brown) and father of Jamie (Bono Brown) and Blake O'Carroll (Blister Brady).<ref name=\"autogenerated\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Hillary Nicholson===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Hillary Nicholson\n|portrayer= [[Sorcha Cusack]] <small>(2011)</small><br>[[Susie Blake]] <small>(2011\u2013)</small>\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132015, 2017\u2013\n|first= 28 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = England\n|occupation = Housewife<br>secretary of the school board\n|father = John Sheridan\n|sisters = Mary Sheridan\n|husband = Sinbad Nicholson (original series)<br>Johnathan Nicholson\n|daughters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Maria Brown|Maria Brown]]\n|nephews = Thomas Clowne\n|nieces = Bethany\n|grandsons = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n}}\n\n'''Hillary Nicholson''' (n\u00e9e '''Sheridan''') is the snobbish mother of Maria and the maternal grandmother of the Brown triplets.\n\nDespite her rich background, her great-grandfather made a living by pushing a cart of dead dogs around the streets. Bar Dermot, Hillary looks down on the Brown family at first but is gradually getting used to them and their surroundings. She is very protective of her daughter, and when planning Dermot and Maria's wedding, thinks of relocating the ceremony to Italy. However, she changes her mind when Agnes reminds her that her father, John, was the vicar at St. Jarleth's Church \u2013 and he hasn't been seen since the money from the collection disappeared. Hillary may seem snobbish and acts like she couldn't care less, but deep down she can be kind and caring.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Dr. Flynn===\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Dr. Flynn\n|portrayer=Derek Riddin\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace =\n|occupation = Doctor\n|aunts = Sheila Flynn\n}}\n\n'''Dr. Flynn''' is [[Finglas]]' resident doctor.\n\nDr. Flynn usually appears in the Brown household attending to Grandad. He is shown to be very capable in his job, despite Agnes often interfering when he is treating Grandad. He also gave Agnes her wish to have Grandad tested for mental problems, for him to be put in a home while she goes to the [[Galway Races]].\n\nDr. Flynn is shown to have a minor romantic interest in Cathy. He also became self-appointed Head Judge of the judging panel of Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition, and abused his position by giving the prize (two tickets to go see the Finglas Warriors football team in the finals) to his aunt, Sheila.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Damien===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Damien\n|portrayer=Conor Moloney\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2012\u2013\n|first= 24 December 2012\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Damien''' is the current priest of the local parish in [[Finglas]].\n\nFather Damien is first seen when Hillary introduces him to Agnes after he comes to Finglas to replace Father Quinn. He is strong to protest against Agnes' play version of [[Nativity of Jesus|the Nativity]]. However, he gives in and gets permission from the Bishop once Agnes gets him to make amends with his own mother over the phone. He baptizes the Brown triplets and later visits Agnes, but accidentally causes her to act-up after he accidentally says one of the hypnosis words that turns her into a stripper (as the hypnotist at the baptism party didn't completely remove the hypnosis from her). When Rory and Dino are getting married, he tells Agnes (despite her protests) that he cannot bless them as the Church is against same-sex marriage. But he later shows up at the Brown house to celebrate their marriage as he personally is happy to celebrate all forms of love.\n\nFather Damien also appears in ''All Round to Mrs Brown's'', where he along with Trevor, hosts a segment called \"Thought for the Day\". In a rather marked contrast to his series self, Father Damien is shown here to be rather childish, often providing non-sequiturs and rather humorous lines to the segment, with Trevor serving as the \"straight man\" in the act.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Quinn===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Quinn\n|portrayer=Gary Lilburn\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132013\n|first= 14 March 2011\n|last= 28 January 2013\n|classification = Former; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Quinn''' is the former priest of the local parish in Finglas.\n\nFather Quinn is first seen when Agnes and Winnie crash the funeral party of Paddy Murphy, believing that it's where Maria's hen party is. He comforts Murphy's widow as Agnes and Winnie leave embarrassed. He begins to lose faith and turns to alcohol when a group of [[Mormons]] begin converting locals. In 2012, he leaves Finglas to go to rehab, at which point, Father Damien replaces him. After returning from rehab, he is quick to drink again after having seen Agnes again, who offers him a bottle, together with an incident involving Dermot's mobile phone, which she believes is stolen and hiding it in her bloomers; unfortunately, Buster rings it, causing Agnes to go crazy.

Later, he comes to blows with Agnes over the issue of whether Bono will be attending the notorious local school, St Stephen's. Mark and Betty want Bono to go to school outside the parish, and Agnes, fearful of Bono getting bullied if he goes to St Stephen's, agrees with them, but Father McBride refuses to sign the form to allow it to happen, saying that too many good children are leaving the parish. However, Lulu quickly makes him change his mind, after she says \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it Father McBride?\", \"Who's for a ride on Father McBride?\" and \"Ooh, that's a big one!\". Fearful of his reputation, Father McBride asks to take care of Lulu. Agnes agrees, but only if he will sign the form; he reluctantly agrees.\n\nFather McBride reappears in [[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie|the movie]], officiating at the funeral for Mary Moccasin. After a four-year absence from the screen, McBride returned, in the 2018 Christmas special \"Exotic Mammy\", as one of the three judges, alongside Hillary Nicholson and Dr. Flynn, in Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition.

These polities existed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and had similar and yet sometimes distinct cultures, values and traditions. The Great Lakes kingdoms were found in [[Southeast Africa]] and some parts of [[Central Africa]], in what is present-day northwest [[Tanzania]], south [[Uganda]], some parts of [[Rwanda]], and Eastern [[Congo Basin|Congo]].\n\n*[[Bunyoro]]\n*[[Buganda]]\n*[[Bugisu]]\n*[[Bukedi]]\n*[[Kingdom of Burundi|Burundi]]\n*[[Busoga]]\n*[[Buvinza]]\n*[[Buyungu]]\n*[[Buzinza]]\n*[[Gisaka]]\n*[[Heru (kingdom)|Heru]]\n*[[Igara (kingdom)|Igara]]\n*[[Ihangiro]]\n*[[Kingdom of Karagwe|Karagwe]]\n*[[Kimwani]]\n*[[Kiziba]]\n*[[Kyamutwara]]\n*[[Kyania]]\n*[[Lango sub-region|Lango]]\n*[[Mpororo]]\n*[[Mubari]]\n*[[Muhambwe]]\n*[[Nkore]]\n*[[Ruguru]]\n*[[Rusubi]]\n*[[Kingdom of Rwanda|Rwanda]]\n*[[Rwenzururu]]\n*[[Sebei]]\n*[[Teso sub-region|Teso]]\n*[[Tooro Kingdom|Tooro]]\n\n==Great Lakes Region: Karagwe, Nkore, and Buhaya==\n[[Kingdom of Karagwe|Karagwe]], [[Nkore]], and [[Buhaya]] formed small neighboring states to the major kingdoms of [[Bunyoro]] and [[Buganda]] in the Great Lakes region. Karagwe and Nkore were individual polities, while Buhaya refers to an area along the western side of [[Lake Victoria]] in which seven small states were recognized: [[Kiamutwara]], [[Kiziba]], [[Ihangiro]], [[Kihanja]], [[Bugabo]], [[Maruku]], and [[Missenye]].\n\nAlthough this entry only deals with the period up to the end of the eighteenth century, it is essential to recognize that the earlier histories of these polities and the detail with which they have been recorded are a direct product of nineteenth- and twentieth-century history and the circumstances which befell them. Nkore (Ankole in colonial times) found itself within the [[British Protectorate of Uganda]] and became a cornerstone of Protectorate policy, being one of the four main kingdoms and enjoying a considerably enlarged territorial status under the Protectorate than it had done in precolonial times. It was also served well by various missionaries, ethnographers, anthropologists, and historians. Buhaya was moderately well served, partly through expedient politics in the early colonial era and the siting of the regional colonial [[administrative center]] in Bukoba. By contrast, Karagwe fell from being one of the most powerful of the nineteenth century states in the Great Lakes, a position it had largely attained through its domination of early [[Indian Ocean]]-Great Lakes [[trade route]]s, to total collapse and obscurity by 1916. Writers on Karagwe have been sporadic and have failed to provide the rich array of texts that are available for Nkore, its northern neighbor. In independent [[Tanzania]], under [[Nyerere]], there was little place for such overtly unequal, precolonial political formations.<ref name=\"bookrags1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/great-lakes-region-karagwe-nkore-and-tf/ |title=Great Lakes Region: Karagwe, Nkore, And Buhaya from Encyclopedia of African History: Volume 1 A\u2013G |publisher=BookRags.com |date=2004-12-14 |accessdate=2011-01-10}}</ref> \n\nNot surprisingly, the earliest [[farming]] settlements appeared in the wet coastal littoral of Buhaya, on the western shores of Lake Victoria. Archaeological research has indicated extensive activity, most notably in terms of [[iron smelting]], from the last few centuries BCE. These societies exploited the extensive [[rainforest]]s that were available at the time and, after initial cultivation of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and other forest crops, presumably became proficient in the exploitation of [[banana]]s. Linguistic and archaeological evidence in Karagwe and Nkore on the other hand, indicates occupation around the beginning of the second millennium, based upon the increasing exploitation of [[cattle]], supported by [[grain]] crops. From these bases, the core elements of the polities undoubtedly developed, although there is little evidence, as yet, to document the process.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nThe actual origins of the dynasties that came to dominate are also unclear, being dependent on the interpretation of oral traditions. At face value, in all areas, dynasties claimed origin back to the [[Cwezi]] persona, [[Wamara]]. Subsequently, power fell into the hands of [[Ruhinda]], and descent was directly drawn to him by many of the royal clans, known as [[Abahinda]]. Reinterpretations of these [[oral tradition]]s suggest that characters such as Wamara and Ruhinda may well have been charismatic chiefs, who, after their deaths, became important spirits controlled by mediums tied to [[political power]]. Shrines to Wamara and Ruhinda were specifically associated with the manipulation and control of [[fertility]].<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nA further integral component of these polities was clans. Each [[polity]] was an amalgamation of clans, and each clan contributed important components to the polity. Clans involved in the polity at an earlier stage tended to be regarded with a higher status. Clans were also associated with specialized activity, such as cattle-herding, iron-smelting, and regulating [[ritual]]s. The royal clan sat atop this confederation and carefully maintained the status quo, by allocating particular offices to specific clans and by accepting wives for the king from the different clans. Thus, the mother of the king and her clan were very powerful in each individual reign, and this power helps to explain the regularity of [[Order of succession|succession]] disputes revealed by oral traditions. Particularly in drier Karagwe and Nkore, there was also an increasing importance in the distinction between cattle-herding Bahima and farmers. In later years, these economic pastimes became almost mutually exclusive and were the foundations of class formation. It is significant, however, that although kings generally leaned toward pastoralism as an ideal lifestyle, even in the later centuries the king stood above the cattle-agriculture dichotomy, practicing rituals which were integral to both economic forms. Most notably, every month kings conducted the New Moon rituals which ensured the fertility of the land and the [[fecundity]] of cattle. Furthermore, at least some kings were also regarded as iron smiths (but not smelters). The best-known example of this was the incorporation of iron-working hammers into the royal regalia of Karagwe, generally associated with [[Omukama Ndagara]] in the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nThese fairly simplistic reconstructions, of course, mask the major tensions and conflicts that existed within these states. An insight into such political intrigue has been provided by the historical work focusing on the [[Kaijja]] shrine, within the Maruku kingdom, twenty kilometers south of Bukoba. The site is the gashani, or jaw-bone shrine, of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century king, [[Rugomora Mahe]], who is said to have occupied the site and to have overseen iron-working there. The site is also an important shrine to the Cwezi spirit, Wamara. All the Buhaya states record a change from [[Hinda clan|Hinda]] to [[Bito]] rulers around the seventeenth century, referring to the extension of Bito dynastic influence from Bunyoro. Significantly, Rugomora Mahe was an early Bito ruler, and his association with the shrine is interpreted as an integral part of the ritual conflict between Hinda followers and their spirits, and the new Bito rulers. At broadly similar times oral traditions in Karagwe and Nkore record incursions and even lengthy occupations by forces from Bunyoro, but emphasize ultimate victory over the invaders.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nIn [[Nkore]], it has been possible to identify sites associated with political authority, extending several centuries back into the past. The locations of these sites indicate that the early core Nkore area was in a restricted highland area, [[Isingiro]], twenty kilometers south of the modern center of [[Mbarara]]. The suggestion is therefore that these were initially very localized political formations, some of which gradually expanded. Military power was initially realized in terms of numbers. The Buhaya states were all small and do not appear to have had a significant military capability. Karagwe does appear to have had military strength, and this may have been due to its greater population size. Nkore, from its small base, does not appear to have had expansionist pretensions, or more importantly, capability, until key changes in its military organization. The creation of permanent levies of troops, known as [[Emitwe]], allowed both the conquest of territory such as Mpororo and [[Buhweju]] and also the protection of its increasing herds from powerful neighbors to the north.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/> \n\nIt is important to emphasize that, in their early stages, all these polities were small and vulnerable. In particular, they appear to have been susceptible to succession disputes, which seem to have been the main cause of conflict. More detailed histories of significant changes in structure and organization only really begin to emerge toward the end of the eighteenth century, when some polities started looking beyond their frontiers for new territories and resources to control.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of Africa]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Africa]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:GreatLakesAfrica.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of African Great Lakes region]]\n[[File:Uganda Protectorate British administration.png|thumb|Realms of Uganda: [[Buganda]], [[Bunyoro]], [[Busoga]], [[Rwenzururu]], [[Tooro Kingdom|Tooro]], [[Ankole]] [[Lango sub-region|Lango]], [[Teso sub-region|Teso]], [[Bukedi]], [[Bugisu]], [[Sebei]]]]\nThe '''African Great Lakes kingdoms''' refers to the numerous historic kingdoms in the [[African Great Lakes]] region.

Clans were also associated with specialized activity, such as cattle-herding, iron-smelting, and regulating [[ritual]]s. The royal clan sat atop this confederation and carefully maintained the status quo, by allocating particular offices to specific clans and by accepting wives for the king from the different clans. Thus, the mother of the king and her clan were very powerful in each individual reign, and this power helps to explain the regularity of [[Order of succession|succession]] disputes revealed by oral traditions. Particularly in drier Karagwe and Nkore, there was also an increasing importance in the distinction between cattle-herding Bahima and farmers. In later years, these economic pastimes became almost mutually exclusive and were the foundations of class formation. It is significant, however, that although kings generally leaned toward pastoralism as an ideal lifestyle, even in the later centuries the king stood above the cattle-agriculture dichotomy, practicing rituals which were integral to both economic forms. Most notably, every month kings conducted the New Moon rituals which ensured the fertility of the land and the [[fecundity]] of cattle. Furthermore, at least some kings were also regarded as iron smiths (but not smelters). The best-known example of this was the incorporation of iron-working hammers into the royal regalia of Karagwe, generally associated with [[Omukama Ndagara]] in the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nThese fairly simplistic reconstructions, of course, mask the major tensions and conflicts that existed within these states. An insight into such political intrigue has been provided by the historical work focusing on the [[Kaijja]] shrine, within the Maruku kingdom, twenty kilometers south of Bukoba. The site is the gashani, or jaw-bone shrine, of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century king, [[Rugomora Mahe]], who is said to have occupied the site and to have overseen iron-working there. The site is also an important shrine to the Cwezi spirit, Wamara. All the Buhaya states record a change from [[Hinda clan|Hinda]] to [[Bito]] rulers around the seventeenth century, referring to the extension of Bito dynastic influence from Bunyoro. Significantly, Rugomora Mahe was an early Bito ruler, and his association with the shrine is interpreted as an integral part of the ritual conflict between Hinda followers and their spirits, and the new Bito rulers. At broadly similar times oral traditions in Karagwe and Nkore record incursions and even lengthy occupations by forces from Bunyoro, but emphasize ultimate victory over the invaders.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\nIn [[Nkore]], it has been possible to identify sites associated with political authority, extending several centuries back into the past. The locations of these sites indicate that the early core Nkore area was in a restricted highland area, [[Isingiro]], twenty kilometers south of the modern center of [[Mbarara]]. The suggestion is therefore that these were initially very localized political formations, some of which gradually expanded. Military power was initially realized in terms of numbers. The Buhaya states were all small and do not appear to have had a significant military capability. Karagwe does appear to have had military strength, and this may have been due to its greater population size. Nkore, from its small base, does not appear to have had expansionist pretensions, or more importantly, capability, until key changes in its military organization. The creation of permanent levies of troops, known as [[Emitwe]], allowed both the conquest of territory such as Mpororo and [[Buhweju]] and also the protection of its increasing herds from powerful neighbors to the north.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/> \n\nIt is important to emphasize that, in their early stages, all these polities were small and vulnerable. In particular, they appear to have been susceptible to succession disputes, which seem to have been the main cause of conflict. More detailed histories of significant changes in structure and organization only really begin to emerge toward the end of the eighteenth century, when some polities started looking beyond their frontiers for new territories and resources to control.<ref name=\"bookrags1\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of Africa]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Jeltz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix links to Kingdom of Karagwe", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_Great_Lakes_kingdoms"}
