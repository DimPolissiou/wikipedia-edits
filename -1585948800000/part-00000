It and some other designs were built in conjunction with [[Avro]]. The pre-war [[Cierva C.30]] proved popular. Nearly 150 were built under licence in the [[United Kingdom]] (by [[Avro]]), in [[Germany]] (by [[Focke-Wulf]]), and in [[France]] (by [[Lior\u00e9-et-Olivier]]).\n\nIn 1936, Cierva was killed in the [[1936 KLM Croydon accident|Croydon KLM airliner accident]] when the aircraft in which he was a passenger crashed after taking off in fog. From 1936 to 1939 [[James Allan Jamieson Bennett]] was Chief Technical Officer of the company. Dr. Bennett carried through with  Cierva's intention to offer the [[Royal Navy]] a gyrodyne, which Cierva had argued would be simpler, more reliable and efficient than the proposed [[helicopter]]. Bennett's design, the C.41, was tendered to the Air Ministry ([[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification S.22/38]]) but preliminary work was abandoned with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Bennett joined [[Fairey Aviation]] in 1945, where he led the development of the [[Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne]].\n\nIn 1943 the Aircraft Department of [[Weir Group|G & J Weir Ltd.]] was reconstituted as the Cierva Autogiro Company to develop helicopter designs for the [[Air Ministry]]. The post-war [[Cierva Air Horse]] was at the time (1948) the world's largest helicopter. \nThe first prototype of the Air Horse crashed killing [[Henry Alan Marsh|Alan Marsh]], Cierva's manager and chief test pilot<ref group=\"note\">Marsh had been with Cierva since 1932 and had been its instructor at the autogyro flying school.

A [[Striker (association football)|striker]], he began his career with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], leaving to join [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in England. He returned to Scotland and had spells with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. Later in his career he went on to play for [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle]], and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]]. He made two international appearances for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] whilst a Hearts player. In 2001 he was shot 7 times by a security guard when he and Steve Fulton attempted to rob a Tandy electrical store. McSwegan was found bleeding outside the West End store with 78 batteries and a handful of loyalty cards. He was charged and given a 6 minth suspended sentence. Steve Fulton is still on the run and was last seen entering Rita's tiger enclosure egging on Curly Watts to end it all.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Domestic===\nMcSwegan was born in [[Glasgow]] and started his career with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], where he scored 5 goals in only 24 appearances during his six years at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], including a goal against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 1992-93#Group stage|1992-93 Champions League]]. His first team opportunities at Rangers, however, appeared to be limited and in 1993 he joined [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for \u00a3400,000. One of his highlights at Notts County was scoring twice as they knocked [[Premier League]] side [[Tottenham Hotspur]] out of the [[1994\u201395 Football League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fans-turn-on-ardiles-after-humiliation-1445278.html |title=Football: Fans turn on Ardiles after humiliation |publisher=Independent |date=27 October 1994 |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> After two seasons in England he returned to Scotland with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] for \u00a3375,000 where he remained for three seasons, scoring 42 goals.\n\nHe joined [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in 1998 on a free transfer where he scored 31 goals in 98 appearances. By 2002, however, McSwegan had fallen out of favour at Hearts and subsequently had loan spells in England with [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] before joining [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] where he remained for two seasons, scoring 17 goals.\n\nHis next professional club was [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] where he played 39 games, scoring just 1 goal against Queen of the South<ref>{{cite news \n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/4468202.stm\n| title = QoS 2-3 Ross County \n| publisher = BBC\n| date = 26 November 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> in two injury-ravaged seasons. Despite these problems, McSwegan returned to top flight football, when signed by Inverness Caledonian Thistle in September 2006 on a short-term deal. McSwegan left [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] at the end of the [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307]] season and joined Peterhead.\n\nMcSwegan joined [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] on 14 March 2008, after previously training with the club and appearing in reserve games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/latestnews.cfm?id=2652|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418205937/http://www.clydefc.co.uk/latestnews.cfm?id=2652|archivedate=18 April 2008|title=Its Hammer Time|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> He made his debut the following day, in a 1-1 draw against [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] in the [[Scottish First Division]].

A [[Striker (association football)|striker]], he began his career with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], leaving to join [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in England. He returned to Scotland and had spells with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. Later in his career he went on to play for [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle]], and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]]. He made two international appearances for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] whilst a Hearts player.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Domestic===\nMcSwegan was born in [[Glasgow]] and started his career with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], where he scored 5 goals in only 24 appearances during his six years at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], including a goal against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 1992-93#Group stage|1992-93 Champions League]]. His first team opportunities at Rangers, however, appeared to be limited and in 1993 he joined [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for \u00a3400,000. One of his highlights at Notts County was scoring twice as they knocked [[Premier League]] side [[Tottenham Hotspur]] out of the [[1994\u201395 Football League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fans-turn-on-ardiles-after-humiliation-1445278.html |title=Football: Fans turn on Ardiles after humiliation |publisher=Independent |date=27 October 1994 |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> After two seasons in England he returned to Scotland with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] for \u00a3375,000 where he remained for three seasons, scoring 42 goals.\n\nHe joined [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in 1998 on a free transfer where he scored 31 goals in 98 appearances. By 2002, however, McSwegan had fallen out of favour at Hearts and subsequently had loan spells in England with [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] before joining [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] where he remained for two seasons, scoring 17 goals.\n\nHis next professional club was [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] where he played 39 games, scoring just 1 goal against Queen of the South<ref>{{cite news \n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/4468202.stm\n| title = QoS 2-3 Ross County \n| publisher = BBC\n| date = 26 November 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> in two injury-ravaged seasons. Despite these problems, McSwegan returned to top flight football, when signed by Inverness Caledonian Thistle in September 2006 on a short-term deal. McSwegan left [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] at the end of the [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307]] season and joined Peterhead.\n\nMcSwegan joined [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] on 14 March 2008, after previously training with the club and appearing in reserve games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/latestnews.cfm?id=2652|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418205937/http://www.clydefc.co.uk/latestnews.cfm?id=2652|archivedate=18 April 2008|title=Its Hammer Time|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> He made his debut the following day, in a 1-1 draw against [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] in the [[Scottish First Division]].

His second and final cap came four days later, against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]. McSwegan started the game, and scored Scotland's second goal in a 3-0 victory.\n\nMcSwegan also coaches young people throughout Glasgow in his role with coaching and groupwork company A&M Training.\n\n====International goals====\n:''Scores and results list Scotland's goal tally first.''\n<!---DO NOT DELETE REPEAT ENTRIES!!!
