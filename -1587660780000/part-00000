The original [[German language|German]] title given by Munch to his work was ''{{lang|de|Der Schrei der Natur}}'' ('''''The Scream of Nature'''''), and the Norwegian title is ''{{lang|no|Skrik}}'' ('''''Shriek'''''). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the [[angst|anxiety]] of the [[human condition]].\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo ({{coord|59|54|02.4|N|10|46|12.9|E|}}), and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive. Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the twenty-third highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction.\n\n==Sources of inspiration==\n[[File:Edvard Munch 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Edvard Munch]], 1921]]\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\n{{quote|One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below.

This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend [[Paul Gauguin]]: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting ''Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles)'' and for the old woman at the left in his painting ''[[Where Do We Come From?

The original [[German language|German]] title given by Munch to his work was ''{{lang|de|Der Schrei der Natur}}'' ('''''The Scream of Nature'''''), and the Norwegian title is ''{{lang|no|Skrik}}'' ('''''Shriek'''''). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the [[angst|anxiety]] of the [[human condition]].\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo ({{coord|59|54|02.4|N|10|46|12.9|E|}}), and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive.

The technology changes, and the weapons thought to be too dangerous to be in private hands change. A civil war cannon is frankly much less dangerous than weapons we are allowed to carry on the streets in many of the states and cities in our country today.

Since then, CRS's popularity in biomedical research started to grow. CRS is mainly used to image lipid, protein, and other bio-molecules in live or fixed cells or tissues without labeling or staining the sample<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1062325706|title=Coherent raman scattering microscopy|others=Cheng, Ji-Xin,, Xie, Xiaoliang Sunney,|isbn=978-1-138-19952-1|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1062325706}}</ref>. CRS can also be used to image samples labeled with Raman Tags<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />, which normally has higher CRS signal than common bio-molecules have. CRS also find applications in other fields like material science and environmental sciences.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Principles energy levels.png|thumb|Energy diagrams of spontaneous and coherent Raman scatterings.]]\nCoherent Raman scattering is based on [[Raman scattering]] (or spontaneous Raman scattering). In spontaneous Raman, only one monochromatic excitation laser is used. Spontaneous Raman scattering's signal intensity grows linearly with the average power of a [[Continuous-wave laser|continuous wave pump laser]]. In CRS, two lasers are used to excite specific vibrational modes of molecules to be imaged.  The laser with a higher photon energy is normally called pump laser and the laser with a lower photon energy is called Stokes laser. Their photon energy differences match the energy of vibrational modes of molecules:\n\n<math>E_{Raman}=E_{pump}-E_{Stokes}</math>,\n\nwhere the <math>E_{Raman}=\\hbar \\Omega,\\ E_{pump}= \\hbar \\omega_{pump},\\ E_{Stokes}=\\hbar \\omega_{Stokes}</math>.\n\nCRS is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical process]], where the signal level is normally multiplication of powers of pump and Stokes lasers. Therefore, most CRS microscopy experiments are performed with [[Pulsed laser|pulsed lasers]], where higher peak power improved the signal levels of CRS significantly.\n\n=== Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) Microscopy ===\n[[File:Forward and epi-detected CARS.tif|alt=|thumb|'''Forward and epi-detected CARS''']]\nIn CARS, photons generated in the anti-Stokes wavelength are being detected as signals.\n\n<math>E_{CARS}=E_{pump}+\\Omega=2\\times E_{pump}-E_{Stokes}</math>\n\nIn CARS microscopy, there are normally two ways to detect the newly generated photons.

In forward-detected CARS, the generated CARS photons together with pump and Stokes lasers go through the samples. The pump and Stokes lasers are completely blocked by a high [[Optical Density|optical density]] (OD) filter. The CARS photons are then detected by a [[Photomultiplier tube|photonmultiplier tube]] (PMT)  or a camera. In epi-detected CARS, back scattered CARS photons are redirected by a [[Dichroic filter|dichroic mirror]] or [[Polarizing beam splitter|polarizing beam splitter.]] After high OD filters are used to block back scattered pump and Stokes lasers, the newly generated photons are detected by a PMT. The signal intensity of CARS has the following relationship with the pump and Stokes laser's intensity <math>I^2_{pump}, I_{Stokes}</math>, the number of molecules <math>N</math> in the focus of the lasers and the third order Raman susceptibility <math>\\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman}</math> of the molecule:\n\n<math>I_{CARS}\\propto (N \\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman})^2 I^2_{pump} I_{Stokes}</math>\n\nThe [[Signal-to-noise ratio (imaging)|signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is a more important characteristic in imaging experiments are square root of the number of CARS photons generated, which is also given below:\n\n<math>\nSNR_{CARS}\\propto N \\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman} I_{pump} \\sqrt{I_{Stokes}}</math>\n\nThere are other non-linear optical processes that also generate photons at the anti-Stokes wavelength.

In the forward-detected SRS, the modulated laser is blocked by high optical density filter and the other laser is measured by a photodiode. Modulation transferred from the modulated laser to the originally unmodulated laser is normally extracted by a lock-in amplifier from the output of photodiode. In epi-detected SRS, there are normally two methods to detect the SRS signal. One method is to detect the back scattered light in front of the objective by a photodiode with a hole at center. The other method is similar to the epi-detected CARS microscopy, where the back-scattered light went through the objective and deflected to the side of the light path normally with a combination of a polarizing beam splitter and a quarter wave-plate.

This can be achieved by image at different wavenumbers one after another. This operation always involves some type of tuning: tuning of laser's wavelength, tuning of spectral filtering device, or tuning of time delay between pump and Stokes lasers in the case of spectral-focusing CRS. Another way of doing multi-color CRS is to use one picosecond laser with a narrow spectral bandwidth (<1 nm) as pump or Stokes and the other laser with broad spectral bandwidth as Stokes or pump laser. In this case, the spectrum of transmitted broadband laser can be spread by a grating and measured by an array of detectors.  \n\n=== Spectral-focusing CRS ===\nCRS normally use lasers with narrow bandwidth lasers, whose bandwidth < 1 nm, to maintain good spectral resolution ~ 15 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

It takes a long time to scan the whole sample, since each pixel requires seconds for data acquisition. So the whole imaging process is long and therefore, it is more suitable for samples that do not move. CRS on the other hand measures signals at single wavenumber but allow fast scanning. If more spectral information is needed, multi-color or hyperspectral CRS can be used and the scanning speed or data quality will be compromised accordingly.\n\n== Comparison between SRS and CARS ==\nIn CRS microscopy, we can regard SRS and CARS as two aspects of the same process. Therefore, they normally provide similar sensitivities, which is normally measured by signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Their differences are mainly in detection methods. In CARS microscopy, PMT, APD or cameras are used as detectors to detect photons generated in the CARS process. PMT is most commonly used due to its large detection area and high speed. In SRS microscopy, photodiodes are normally used to measure the laser beams, which is higher in power. Because of such differences, the application of CARS and SRS are also different.  \n\nPMT normally has relatively low [[quantum efficiency]] compared with photodiodes. This will negatively impact the SNR of CARS microscopy. PMT's also has reduced sensitivity for lasers with wavelength longer than 650 nm. Therefore, with the commonly used laser system for CRS, CARS is mainly used to image at high wavenumber region <math>(2800\\ cm^{-1}\\sim3400\\ cm^{-1})</math>. The SNR of CARS microscopy is normally poor for finger-print imaging <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.  \n\nSRS microscopy mainly use [[Photodiode|silicon photodiode]] as detectors. Si photoidoes have much higher quantum efficiency than PMT, that is one of the reasons that the SNR of SRS can be slightly better than CARS in many cases. Si Photodiodes also suffer reduced sensitivity when the wavelength of laser is longer than 850 nm. However, the sensitivity is still relatively high and allow for imaging in fingerprint region <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.    \n\n== See Also ==\n[[Raman scattering]]\n\n[[Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n[[Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy|CARS spectroscopy]]\n\n== References ==<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

In spontaneous Raman, only one monochromatic excitation laser is used. Spontaneous Raman scattering's signal intensity grows linearly with the average power of a [[Continuous-wave laser|continuous wave pump laser]]. In CRS, two lasers are used to excite specific vibrational modes of molecules to be imaged.  The laser with a higher photon energy is normally called pump laser and the laser with a lower photon energy is called Stokes laser.

In the forward-detected SRS, the modulated laser is blocked by high optical density filter and the other laser is measured by a photodiode.

In epi-detected SRS, there are normally two methods to detect the SRS signal. One method is to detect the back scattered light in front of the objective by a photodiode with a hole at center. The other method is similar to the epi-detected CARS microscopy, where the back-scattered light went through the objective and deflected to the side of the light path normally with a combination of a polarizing beam splitter and a quarter wave-plate.

This can be achieved by image at different wavenumbers one after another. This operation always involves some type of tuning: tuning of laser's wavelength, tuning of spectral filtering device, or tuning of time delay between pump and Stokes lasers in the case of spectral-focusing CRS. Another way of doing multi-color CRS is to use one picosecond laser with a narrow spectral bandwidth (<1 nm) as pump or Stokes and the other laser with broad spectral bandwidth as Stokes or pump laser. In this case, the spectrum of transmitted broadband laser can be spread by a grating and measured by an array of detectors.  \n\n=== Spectral-focusing CRS ===\nCRS normally use lasers with narrow bandwidth lasers, whose bandwidth < 1 nm, to maintain good spectral resolution ~ 15 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

It takes a long time to scan the whole sample, since each pixel requires seconds for data acquisition. So the whole imaging process is long and therefore, it is more suitable for samples that do not move. CRS on the other hand measures signals at single wavenumber but allow fast scanning. If more spectral information is needed, multi-color or hyperspectral CRS can be used and the scanning speed or data quality will be compromised accordingly.\n\n== Comparison between SRS and CARS ==\nIn CRS microscopy, we can regard SRS and CARS as two aspects of the same process. Therefore, they normally provide similar sensitivities, which is normally measured by signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Their differences are mainly in detection methods. In CARS microscopy, PMT, APD or cameras are used as detectors to detect photons generated in the CARS process. PMT is most commonly used due to its large detection area and high speed. In SRS microscopy, photodiodes are normally used to measure the laser beams, which is higher in power. Because of such differences, the application of CARS and SRS are also different.  \n\nPMT normally has relatively low [[quantum efficiency]] compared with photodiodes. This will negatively impact the SNR of CARS microscopy. PMT's also has reduced sensitivity for lasers with wavelength longer than 650 nm. Therefore, with the commonly used laser system for CRS, CARS is mainly used to image at high wavenumber region <math>(2800\\ cm^{-1}\\sim3400\\ cm^{-1})</math>. The SNR of CARS microscopy is normally poor for finger-print imaging <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.  \n\nSRS microscopy mainly use [[Photodiode|silicon photodiode]] as detectors. Si photoidoes have much higher quantum efficiency than PMT, that is one of the reasons that the SNR of SRS can be slightly better than CARS in many cases. Si Photodiodes also suffer reduced sensitivity when the wavelength of laser is longer than 850 nm. However, the sensitivity is still relatively high and allow for imaging in fingerprint region <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.    \n\n== See Also ==\n[[Raman scattering]]\n\n[[Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n[[Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy|CARS spectroscopy]]\n\n{{tl|AFC submission|t||ts=20190717202416|u=YangWenlong|ns=2|demo=}}<!-- Important, do not remove this line before article has been created. -->\n\n== References ==<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

It is located on the north side of the current [[Sierra Madre Blvd]] at Hermosa. In 1890 Sierra Madre Blvd was a dirt street called Central Avenue. Old North Church is currently owned by its builder, Sierra Madre Congregational Church. The Old North Church is closely linked with the early settlement of Sierra Madre.<ref name=\"smccnet\">{{cite web|url=http://christchurchsm.org/about/|title=christchurchsm.org/about/, Sierra Madre Congregational Church-(SMCC), Church History, EARLY YEARS|author=|date=|website=smccnet.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>  The community of Sierra Madre was established in the fall of 1881. Sierra Madre Congregational Church started as a [[Sunday School]] class in February 1882. Without a building of its own, the church originally met in the city's original 1882 [[one-room school]]house at the corner of Hermosa and Live Oak, now called [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove]]. To use the schoolhouse as a church on Sunday mornings, the [[pump organ]], [[Hymnal|hymnbooks]], and winter [[firewood]] were transported to the schoolhouse by the attendees. The following years the Church met in the original [[City Hall]] at the corner Baldwin and Central Ave (Sierra Madre), then the original city [[library]] (1889), located at the current library site.  With the completion of the Old North Church in 1890, the church had its own meeting spot. Congregational Church of Sierra Madre was officially established on March 27, 1886 as a [[nondenominational church]] [[congregational church]], with 13 founding members, called ''First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre'' then. One of the 13 founding members was Mrs. Annetta M. Carter, wife of the city founder Nathaniel Coburn Carter. From 1908 to 1910 the Old North Church was expanded with the addition of new meeting rooms.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/histprop/191.pdf|title=Sierra Madre Historical Preservation Society, Old North Church|author=|date=|website=smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/photo-gallery.html|title=Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www.smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Church's second, and current, main building was built across the street.

It is located on the north side of the current [[Sierra Madre Blvd]] at Hermosa. In 1890 Sierra Madre Blvd was a dirt street called Central Avenue.

The Old North Church is closely linked with the early settlement of Sierra Madre.<ref name=\"smccnet\">{{cite web|url=http://christchurchsm.org/about/|title=christchurchsm.org/about/, Sierra Madre Congregational Church-(SMCC), Church History, EARLY YEARS|author=|date=|website=smccnet.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>  The community of Sierra Madre was established in the fall of 1881. Sierra Madre Congregational Church started as a [[Sunday School]] class in February 1882. Without a building of its own, the church originally met in the city's original 1882 [[one-room school]]house at the corner of Hermosa and Live Oak, now called [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove]]. To use the schoolhouse as a church on Sunday mornings, the [[pump organ]], [[Hymnal|hymnbooks]], and winter [[firewood]] were transported to the schoolhouse by the attendees. The following years the Church met in the original [[City Hall]] at the corner Baldwin and Central Ave (Sierra Madre), then the original city [[library]] (1889), located at the current library site.  With the completion of the Old North Church in 1890, the church had its own meeting spot. Congregational Church of Sierra Madre was officially established on March 27, 1886 as a [[nondenominational church]] [[congregational church]], with 13 founding members, called ''First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre'' then. One of the 13 founding members was Mrs. Annetta M. Carter, wife of the city founder Nathaniel Coburn Carter. From 1908 to 1910 the Old North Church was expanded with the addition of new meeting rooms.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/histprop/191.pdf|title=Sierra Madre Historical Preservation Society, Old North Church|author=|date=|website=smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/photo-gallery.html|title=Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www.smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Church's second, and current, main building was built across the street. Construction of the new building started in 1926 with Pritchard Hall and was completed in 1928 with the new sanctuary dedicated on June 17, 1928. The sanctuary cornerstone was laid on Feb. 19, 1928.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /> The 1928 Church building is also a Sierra Madre designated historical landmark, as site #39.

With the destruction of their staff of life, the buffalo, the nomadic Sioux people began to agree to settle in reservations such as the [[Sioux Valley First Nation|Sioux Valley Dakota Nation]], or left the area entirely.\n\nFrench Canadians also passed through the area on river boats on their way to the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay Post]], [[Fort Ellice]] located near present-day [[St. Lazare, Manitoba]]. The city of Brandon gets its name from the Blue Hills south of the city, which got their name from a Hudson's Bay trading post known as [[Brandon House]], which got its name from a hill on an island in James Bay where [[Thomas James (sea captain)|Captain James]] had anchored his ship in 1631.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\nDuring the 1870s it was believed by most that the transcontinental railway would take a northwesterly direction from [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba|Portage la Prairie]]. Many thought that the route would most likely go through either [[Minnedosa, Manitoba|Minnedosa]] or [[Rapid City, Manitoba]] because they were both located at natural river crossings. Rapid City was the front runner for the site of the new railway and had prepared for the impending building boom accordingly. But suddenly, in 1881, the builders of the railway decided to take a more westerly route from Winnipeg, towards Grand Valley.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Grand Valley was located on the northern side of the Assiniboine, opposite the side of the river where present-day Brandon sits.\n\nGrand Valley was originally settled by two brothers John and Dougal McVicar, and their families. With the expectation of the new railroad, settlers and prospectors now rushed to an area they had previously avoided.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Around 1879 a few settlers led by Reverend George Roddick had begun to build their new homes about {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} south of Grand Valley, at the foot of the Brandon Hills.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\n[[File:Wagons loaded with bags of grain, awaiting delivery to elevators in Brandon, circa 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Wagons loaded with bags of [[Food grain|grain]] awaiting delivery to [[Grain elevator|elevators]] in Brandon, {{circa|1888}}]]Meanwhile, in Grand Valley with the promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam [[paddle steamer|sternwheelers]] to the city, each bringing more and more settlers.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> In the spring of 1881, General [[Thomas L. Rosser]], Chief Engineer of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that \"I'll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here\".<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=}} west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\nAfter the location of the railway was once again changed, there was still hope that Grand Valley could become a rival neighbour to Brandon. But late in June 1881 it became clear that Grand Valley would not have lasted as a city long term. A flood hit in late June, and as the city was built on a low-lying part of the river, flooded quickly and dramatically.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Because Grand Valley was built on a low flood plain, and Brandon was built on the heights on the other side, it became apparent that Brandon was the best place for a city in the area.\n\nRosser had chosen Brandon as the townsite in May 1881, within a year settlers had flocked to Brandon in such numbers that it was incorporated as a city. Brandon never spent any time as a town or village but has only existed as a city.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\nAn [[Internment camp]] was set up at the Exhibition Building in Brandon from September 1914 to July 1916.<ref>{{cite web   |title=Internment Camps in Canada during the First and Second World Wars, Library and Archives Canada   |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/the-public/005-1142.27-e.html   |url-status=live   |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905213052/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/the-public/005-1142.27-e.html   |archivedate=5 September 2014   |df=dmy-all   }}</ref> Post [[World War II]], Brandon experience a minor disaster when an explosion at the Manitoba Power Commission's steam plant caused the 40 metre (130&nbsp;ft) brick chimney to collapse, killing two workers in the process.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deadly 1957 explosion still echoes |url=https://www.brandonsun.com/local/deadly-1957-explosion-still-echoes-443859813.html |website=[[Brandon Sun]] |date=September 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917010443/https://www.brandonsun.com/local/deadly-1957-explosion-still-echoes-443859813.html |archivedate=17 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary times, [[Brandon City Council]] elected its first female mayor when [[Shari Decter Hirst]] defeated incumbent [[Dave Burgess (politician)|Dave Burgess]] in the [[2010 Manitoba municipal elections|2010 municipal election]].<ref name=\"Shari\">{{cite news|url=http://www.brandonsun.com/breaking-news/Meet-your-new-city-council-106078264.html?thx=y|title=Meet your new city council|publisher=[[Brandon Sun]]|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029195102/http://www.brandonsun.com/breaking-news/Meet-your-new-city-council-106078264.html?thx=y|archivedate=29 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View of Brandon from Daly overpass.jpg|thumb|left|View of Downtown Brandon and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] yards from the Daly overpass]]\nBrandon is located in western Manitoba, on the banks of the Assiniboine river.

With the destruction of their staff of life, the buffalo, the nomadic Sioux people began to agree to settle in reservations such as the [[Sioux Valley First Nation|Sioux Valley Dakota Nation]], or left the area entirely.\n\nFrench Canadians also passed through the area on river boats on their way to the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay Post]], [[Fort Ellice]] located near present-day [[St. Lazare, Manitoba]]. The city of Brandon gets its name from the Blue Hills south of the city, which got their name from a Hudson's Bay trading post known as [[Brandon House]], which got its name from a hill on an island in James Bay where [[Thomas James (sea captain)|Captain James]] had anchored his ship in 1631.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\nDuring the 1870s it was believed by most that the transcontinental railway would take a northwesterly direction from [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba|Portage la Prairie]]. Many thought that the route would most likely go through either [[Minnedosa, Manitoba|Minnedosa]] or [[Rapid City, Manitoba]] because they were both located at natural river crossings. Rapid City was the front runner for the site of the new railway and had prepared for the impending building boom accordingly. But suddenly, in 1881, the builders of the railway decided to take a more westerly route from Winnipeg, towards Grand Valley.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Grand Valley was located on the northern side of the Assiniboine, opposite the side of the river where present-day Brandon sits.\n\nGrand Valley was originally settled by two brothers John and Dougal McVicar, and their families. With the expectation of the new railroad, settlers and prospectors now rushed to an area they had previously avoided.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Around 1879 a few settlers led by Reverend George Roddick had begun to build their new homes about {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} south of Grand Valley, at the foot of the Brandon Hills.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\n[[File:Wagons loaded with bags of grain, awaiting delivery to elevators in Brandon, circa 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Wagons loaded with bags of [[Food grain|grain]] awaiting delivery to [[Grain elevator|elevators]] in Brandon, {{circa|1888}}]]Meanwhile, in Grand Valley with the promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam [[paddle steamer|sternwheelers]] to the city, each bringing more and more settlers.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> In the spring of 1881, General [[Thomas L. Rosser]], Chief Engineer of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that \"I'll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here\".<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=}} west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\nAfter the location of the railway was once again changed, there was still hope that Grand Valley could become a rival neighbour to Brandon. But late in June 1881 it became clear that Grand Valley would not have lasted as a city long term. A flood hit in late June, and as the city was built on a low-lying part of the river, flooded quickly and dramatically.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/> Because Grand Valley was built on a low flood plain, and Brandon was built on the heights on the other side, it became apparent that Brandon was the best place for a city in the area.\n\nRosser had chosen Brandon as the townsite in May 1881, within a year settlers had flocked to Brandon in such numbers that it was incorporated as a city. Brandon never spent any time as a town or village but has only existed as a city.<ref name=\"History of Brandon\"/>\n\nAn [[Internment camp]] was set up at the Exhibition Building in Brandon from September 1914 to July 1916.<ref>{{cite web   |title=Internment Camps in Canada during the First and Second World Wars, Library and Archives Canada   |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/the-public/005-1142.27-e.html   |url-status=live   |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905213052/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/the-public/005-1142.27-e.html   |archivedate=5 September 2014   |df=dmy-all   }}</ref> Post [[World War II]], Brandon experience a minor disaster when an explosion at the Manitoba Power Commission's steam plant caused the 40 metre (130&nbsp;ft) brick chimney to collapse, killing two workers in the process.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deadly 1957 explosion still echoes |url=https://www.brandonsun.com/local/deadly-1957-explosion-still-echoes-443859813.html |website=[[Brandon Sun]] |date=September 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917010443/https://www.brandonsun.com/local/deadly-1957-explosion-still-echoes-443859813.html |archivedate=17 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary times, [[Brandon City Council]] elected its first female mayor when [[Shari Decter Hirst]] defeated incumbent [[Dave Burgess (politician)|Dave Burgess]] in the [[2010 Manitoba municipal elections|2010 municipal election]].<ref name=\"Shari\">{{cite news|url=http://www.brandonsun.com/breaking-news/Meet-your-new-city-council-106078264.html?thx=y|title=Meet your new city council|publisher=[[Brandon Sun]]|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029195102/http://www.brandonsun.com/breaking-news/Meet-your-new-city-council-106078264.html?thx=y|archivedate=29 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View of Brandon from Daly overpass.jpg|thumb|left|View of Downtown Brandon and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] yards from the Daly overpass]]\nBrandon is located in western Manitoba, on the banks of the Assiniboine river.
