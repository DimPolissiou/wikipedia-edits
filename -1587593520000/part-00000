From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530\u2013548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.<ref>Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), \"[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}</ref>\n\n====Precarious manhood====\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u201386 | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e388ea50eefccf3ed156d8ceebff986981c3796 }}</ref> \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved.

From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530\u2013548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.<ref>Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), \"[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}</ref>\n\n====Precarious manhood====\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u201386 | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e388ea50eefccf3ed156d8ceebff986981c3796 }}</ref> \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved.

Its title track exhorted his friends to mark his death with a party, and then forget him. The album also included \"Lah-Di-Dah\", in which a prospective bridegroom assures his bride he loves her so much that he will try to be nice to her dreadful family.<ref name=\"LWT\" />\n\nThis in turn led to a BBC television slot, composing a weekly topical song for [[Bernard Braden]]'s consumer magazine programme ''Braden's Week''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144656/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jake Thackray biography |website=AllMusic.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> He was not immediately popular &ndash; his first appearance in late 1968 provoked letters demanding his dismissal &ndash; but he eventually won over the audience.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Bernard |last=Braden |authorlink=Bernard Braden |url=http://www.jakethackray.com/content/view/19/32/ |title=UK sleeve notes to 'Jake's Progress' (1968) |website=jakethackray.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> After ''Braden's Week'' was cancelled in 1972, Thackray took up the same role on its successor show, ''[[That's Life!]]''.

The album also included \"Lah-Di-Dah\", in which a prospective bridegroom assures his bride he loves her so much that he will try to be nice to her dreadful family.<ref name=\"LWT\" />\n\nThis in turn led to a BBC television slot, composing a weekly topical song for [[Bernard Braden]]'s consumer magazine programme ''Braden's Week''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144656/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jake Thackray biography |website=AllMusic.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> He was not immediately popular &ndash; his first appearance in late 1968 provoked letters demanding his dismissal &ndash; but he eventually won over the audience.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Bernard |last=Braden |authorlink=Bernard Braden |url=http://www.jakethackray.com/content/view/19/32/ |title=UK sleeve notes to 'Jake's Progress' (1968) |website=jakethackray.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> After ''Braden's Week'' was cancelled in 1972, Thackray took up the same role on its successor show, ''[[That's Life!]]''.

{"title_page": "Prepared statement", "text_new": "In [[database management system]]s (DBMS), a '''prepared statement''' or '''parameterized statement''' is a feature used to execute the same or similar database statements repeatedly with high efficiency. Typically used with [[SQL]] statements such as queries or updates, the prepared statement takes the form of a [[Template processor|template]] into which certain constant values are substituted during each execution.\n\nThe typical workflow of using a prepared statement is as follows:\n\n# '''Prepare''': At first, the application creates the statement template and sends it to the DBMS. Certain values are left unspecified, called ''parameters'', ''placeholders'' or ''bind variables'' (labelled \"?\" below):\n#: {{code|lang=sql|INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (?, ?);}}\n# Then, the DBMS compiles (parses, [[query optimization|optimizes]] and translates) the statement template, and stores the result without executing it.\n# '''Execute''': At a later time, the application supplies (or ''binds'') values for the parameters of the statement template, and the DBMS executes the statement (possibly returning a result). The application may execute the statement as many times as it wants with different values. In the above example, it might supply \"bike\" for the first parameter and \"10900\" for the second parameter.\n\nAs compared to executing statements directly, prepared statements offer two main advantages:<ref name=phpmanual>{{cite web|last=The PHP Documentation Group|title=Prepared statements and stored procedures|url=http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php|work=PHP Manual|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n* The overhead of compiling the statement is incurred only once, although the statement is executed multiple times. However not all optimization can be performed at the time the statement template is compiled, for two reasons: the best plan may depend on the specific values of the parameters, and the best plan may change as tables and indexes change over time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petrunia|first=Sergey|title=MySQL Optimizer and Prepared Statements|url=http://s.petrunia.net/blog/?p=16|work=Sergey Petrunia's blog|date=28 April 2007|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> \n* Prepared statements are resilient against [[SQL injection]] because values which are transmitted later using a different protocol are not compiled like the statement template. If the statement template is not derived from external input, SQL injection cannot occur.\n\nOn the other hand, if a query is executed only once, server-side prepared statements can be slower because of the additional round-trip to the server.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zaitsev|first=Peter|title=MySQL Prepared Statements|url=http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/08/02/mysql-prepared-statements/|work=MySQL Performance Blog|date=2 August 2006|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> Implementation limitations may also lead to performance penalties; for example, some versions of MySQL did not cache results of prepared queries.<ref>{{cite web|title=7.6.3.1. How the Query Cache Operates|url=http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/query-cache-operation.html|work=MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> \nA [[stored procedure]], which is also precompiled and stored on the server for later execution, has similar advantages. Unlike a stored procedure, a prepared statement is not normally written in a procedural language and cannot use or modify variables or use control flow structures, relying instead on the declarative database query language. Due to their simplicity and client-side emulation, prepared statements are more portable across vendors.\n\n== Software support ==\nMajor [[DBMS]]s, including [[MySQL]],<ref>{{cite web|last= Oracle|title= 20.9.4.

Typically used with [[SQL]] statements such as queries or updates, the prepared statement takes the form of a [[Template processor|template]] into which certain constant values are substituted during each execution.\n\nThe typical workflow of using a prepared statement is as follows:\n\n# '''Prepare''': At first, the application creates the statement template and sends it to the DBMS. Certain values are left unspecified, called ''parameters'', ''placeholders'' or ''bind variables'' (labelled \"?\" below):\n#: {{code|lang=sql|INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (?, ?);}}\n# Then, the DBMS compiles (parses, [[query optimization|optimizes]] and translates) the statement template, and stores the result without executing it.\n# '''Execute''': At a later time, the application supplies (or ''binds'') values for the parameters of the statement template, and the DBMS executes the statement (possibly returning a result). The application may execute the statement as many times as it wants with different values. In the above example, it might supply \"bike\" for the first parameter and \"10900\" for the second parameter.\n\nAs compared to executing statements directly, prepared statements offer two main advantages:<ref name=phpmanual>{{cite web|last=The PHP Documentation Group|title=Prepared statements and stored procedures|url=http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php|work=PHP Manual|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n* The overhead of compiling the statement is incurred only once, although the statement is executed multiple times. However not all optimization can be performed at the time the statement template is compiled, for two reasons: the best plan may depend on the specific values of the parameters, and the best plan may change as tables and indexes change over time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petrunia|first=Sergey|title=MySQL Optimizer and Prepared Statements|url=http://s.petrunia.net/blog/?p=16|work=Sergey Petrunia's blog|date=28 April 2007|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> \n* Prepared statements are resilient against [[SQL injection]] because values which are transmitted later using a different protocol are not compiled like the statement template. If the statement template is not derived from external input, SQL injection cannot occur.\n\nOn the other hand, if a query is executed only once, server-side prepared statements can be slower because of the additional round-trip to the server.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zaitsev|first=Peter|title=MySQL Prepared Statements|url=http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/08/02/mysql-prepared-statements/|work=MySQL Performance Blog|date=2 August 2006|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> Implementation limitations may also lead to performance penalties; for example, some versions of MySQL did not cache results of prepared queries.<ref>{{cite web|title=7.6.3.1.

Unlike a stored procedure, a prepared statement is not normally written in a procedural language and cannot use or modify variables or use control flow structures, relying instead on the declarative database query language.

The estate provided an attractive, picturesque setting, as it was situated on Centre Street, in the neighborhood of Bussy Park and the [[Arnold Arboretum]]. Having previously been owned by J. Gardiner Weld, it was purchased by Seth Adams with his fortune acquired from his sugar refinery in South Boston. With his brother Isaac, Seth had formerly manufactured printing presses and machinery. On his death, his estate bequeathed $600,000 for the establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated and nervous people: inhabitants of the State who were not insane. The trustees purchased neighboring properties for the Asylum in 1879.The estate was vacated in 1976 and left to The Adams Trust.\n\n==Theoretical Practice==\nThe institution was to incorporate the theories of [[Thomas Kirkbride]]. Kirkbride was a contemporary Philadelphian psychiatrist who developed the system of moral treatment for patients with [[nervous disorder]]s. In his practice, he advocated a home-style atmosphere, non-isolation, and the dignity of the patients. The asylum was to stress the importance of patient individuality and freedom of movement.\n\n==Patients==\nThe first patient of the asylum was admitted on April 11, 1880. The statistics of the asylum show that of those admitted, unmarried women are in a great majority.  According to the doctor, the nervousness in these women was directly related to them out working themselves and waiting upon others. Housework and teaching contributed to nearly 50 percent of the victims of nervous disorders. Nearly 20 percent of the patients came under the head of \u201chousewives\u201d. Among housewives, overwork, care, anxiety, and sleeplessness, incident to domestic afflictions, were the assigned causes.\n\nThe number of recoveries at the asylum was not large. One of the asylum's doctors, Dr. Webber, stated in an annual report, \u201cMany patients have been ailing for years, or have inherited a weak, nervous organization, and those among such patients whose means have been limited have been obliged to uses their strength and energy in keeping the home circle unbroken.  The strain of this upon a naturally weak, nervous system is severe, and in such cases, a partial recovery is the most that can be expected from a \u2018few months\u2019 stay at the asylum.

The estate provided an attractive, picturesque setting, as it was situated on Centre Street, in the neighborhood of Bussy Park and the [[Arnold Arboretum]]. Having previously been owned by J. Gardiner Weld, it was purchased by Seth Adams with his fortune acquired from his sugar refinery in South Boston. With his brother Isaac, Seth had formerly manufactured printing presses and machinery. On his death, his estate bequeathed $600,000 for the establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated and nervous people: inhabitants of the State who were not insane. The trustees purchased neighboring properties for the Asylum in 1879.The estate was vacated in 1976 and left to The Adams Trust.\n\n==Theoretical Practice==\nThe institution was to incorporate the theories of [[Thomas Kirkbride]]. Kirkbride was a contemporary Philadelphian psychiatrist who developed the system of moral treatment for patients with [[nervous disorder]]s. In his practice, he advocated a home-style atmosphere, non-isolation, and the dignity of the patients. The asylum was to stress the importance of patient individuality and freedom of movement.\n\n==Patients==\nThe first patient of the asylum was admitted on April 11, 1880. The statistics of the asylum show that of those admitted, unmarried women are in a great majority.  According to the doctor, the nervousness in these women was directly related to them out working themselves and waiting upon others. Housework and teaching contributed to nearly 50 percent of the victims of nervous disorders. Nearly 20 percent of the patients came under the head of \u201chousewives\u201d. Among housewives, overwork, care, anxiety, and sleeplessness, incident to domestic afflictions, were the assigned causes.\n\nThe number of recoveries at the asylum was not large. One of the asylum's doctors, Dr. Webber, stated in an annual report, \u201cMany patients have been ailing for years, or have inherited a weak, nervous organization, and those among such patients whose means have been limited have been obliged to uses their strength and energy in keeping the home circle unbroken.  The strain of this upon a naturally weak, nervous system is severe, and in such cases, a partial recovery is the most that can be expected from a \u2018few months\u2019 stay at the asylum.  The relief obtained is, however, of great benefit, enabling the patient to take up her burdens again with fresh courage and renewed strength.  They do not realize the amount of strength they have gained until after returning to their accustomed labors, and many continue to improve, and subsequently regain full health.\u201d\n\nThe average stay of patients at the Asylum was a little over four months, and few stayed longer than six.
