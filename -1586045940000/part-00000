The particular clones of Sangiovese are unique to the Montalcino region and have developed in adaption to that area's specific ''terroir''. The altitude and climate of the Montalcino region has provided an area where Sangiovese ripens more fully and consistently than anywhere else in Tuscany. These factors contribute to the [[body (wine)|body]], color, extract and [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s commonly associated with Brunello di Montalcino.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/> In contrast to Chianti, the other famous Sangiovese based wine of Tuscany, Brunello di Montalcinos have a more fleshy texture with common aromas and flavors of [[blackberry]], [[black cherry]], [[black raspberry]], [[chocolate]], [[leather]] and violets.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 382-384\"/>\n\nBrunello is often compared with the [[Pinot noir]] wines of [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] with its smooth tannins and ripe, fruit driven character.<ref name=\"Suckling pg 42\"/> The high acidity of the wine allows it to pair well with food, especially grilled meat and [[game (food)|game]].

[[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]] notes that most Brunellos often need at least 10 years before they shed their youthfulness and start to harmonize their flavors.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n==Other wines==\n\nIn addition to Brunello di Montalcino, producers in the Montalcino region can produce wine under [[Rosso di Montalcino]], [[Sant'Antimo (wine)|Sant'Antimo]] and [[Moscadello di Montalcino (wine)|Moscadello di Montalcino]] DOCs as well as the generic ''[[Indicazione geografica tipica]]'' designation of Toscana IGT. Moscadello di Montalcino is a [[sweetness of wine|sweet]] white wine made from [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]]. The style was once widely produced in Montalcino but fell out of style following World War II. In the early 1980s, the wine estate of [[Castello Banfi]] attempted to revive the style by planting Muscat. The Sant'Antimo DOC was named for the [[St. Antimo's Abbey|9th century abbey]] built by [[Charlemagne]]. In the 1970s, producers in Montalcino were influenced by the success of the \"[[Super Tuscan]]\" style of wine that was gaining international recognition for [[Chianti]] producers who deviated from DOC regulations with [[winemaking]] techniques such blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. In 1996, Italian authorities approved the Sant'Antimo DOC to allow Montalcino producers to produce DOC designated wines that were not 100% Sangiovese. These wines include blended ''Bianco'' and ''Rosso'' wines as well as varietally labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, [[Chardonnay]], Merlot, [[Pinot grigio]], [[Pinot nero]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]].<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n===Rosso di Montalcino===\n[[File:Rosso di Montalcino.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A Rosso di Montalcino made from 100% Sangiovese in the Brunello di Montalcino region.]]\nThe Rosso di Montalcino DOC was established in 1984 as a means of giving Brunello di Montalcino producers the flexibility to continue the tradition of long aging of the region's flagship wine. Rosso di Montalcino is made from 100% Sangiovese grown in the same delineated region as Brunello di Montalcino. However, the wine is required to spend only six months aging in oak and 1 year total aging before release. This allows Brunello producers to make an earlier releasing wine that can generate cash flow while their Brunello di Montalcino age for their complete duration. In less than ideal vintages some producers will relegate all their grapes to Rosso di Montalcino production and not make a Brunello. Wineries can also declassify their Brunello that has already been aging 2\u20133 years and release it as Rosso di Montalcino if the wine is not developing to their expectations. Rosso di Montalcino is typically lighter, fresher and more approachable upon release though some producers will make wines with more Brunello like characteristics. These \"Baby Brunellos\" are often 1/3 to 1/2 the price of Brunello di Montalcino.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n==Vintage quality evaluation==\nThe Consorzio del Vino Brunello di Montalcino classifies every year the new wine production, in order to rate the Montalcino harvest and its wines Brunello di Montalcino, Rosso di Montalcino, Moscadello di Montalcino and Sant\u2019Antimo.\nThe evaluation takes place every January, by having wine samples of the latest harvest undergo chemical/physical and organoleptic analyses.\nThe Tasting Committee is composed up of 20 technicians operating in Montalcino, with extensive experience in the production of this area.\nThe evaluation is expressed in stars, corresponding to the following classification:\n\n- insufficent vintage (one star)\n\n- fair vintage (two stars)\n\n- good vintage (three stars)\n\n- exellent vintage (four stars)\n\n- outstanding vintage (five stars)\n\nThe declaration of the stars assigned to the vintage takes place in February each year, as part of the event \"BENVENUTO BRUNELLO\".<ref>[https://www.consorziobrunellodimontalcino.it/en/583/wines '''Consorzio Del Vino Brunello di Montalcino''', Vintage Quality Evaluation]</ref>\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brunello Di Montalcino}}\n[[Category:Italian DOCG]]\n[[Category:Wines of Tuscany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{coord|43.0352026|11.4217104|display=title}}\n\n[[File:Montalcino 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Montalcino]]\n'''Brunello di Montalcino''' is a red [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita|DOCG]] [[Italian wine]] produced in the [[vineyard]]s surrounding the town of [[Montalcino]], in the province of [[Siena]], located about 80&nbsp;km south of [[Florence]] in the [[Tuscany wine]] region.

The particular clones of Sangiovese are unique to the Montalcino region and have developed in adaption to that area's specific ''terroir''. The altitude and climate of the Montalcino region has provided an area where Sangiovese ripens more fully and consistently than anywhere else in Tuscany. These factors contribute to the [[body (wine)|body]], color, extract and [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s commonly associated with Brunello di Montalcino.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/> In contrast to Chianti, the other famous Sangiovese based wine of Tuscany, Brunello di Montalcinos have a more fleshy texture with common aromas and flavors of [[blackberry]], [[black cherry]], [[black raspberry]], [[chocolate]], [[leather]] and violets.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 382-384\"/>\n\nBrunello is often compared with the [[Pinot noir]] wines of [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] with its smooth tannins and ripe, fruit driven character.<ref name=\"Suckling pg 42\"/> The high acidity of the wine allows it to pair well with food, especially grilled meat and [[game (food)|game]]. A large portion of Brunello sold in the [[United States]] is purchased in restaurants. The wine has become particularly popular in America with nearly 1 out of every 3 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino being sold in the US.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brunello Di Montalcino|date=31 July 2007|author=James Suckling|work=Wine Spectator|url=http://www.winespectator.com/magazine/show/id/12053|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref> Brunello di Montalcino are known for their ability to age with well made examples from exceptional vintages often showcasing development for several decades. [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]] notes that most Brunellos often need at least 10 years before they shed their youthfulness and start to harmonize their flavors.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n==Other wines==\n\nIn addition to Brunello di Montalcino, producers in the Montalcino region can produce wine under [[Rosso di Montalcino]], [[Sant'Antimo (wine)|Sant'Antimo]] and [[Moscadello di Montalcino (wine)|Moscadello di Montalcino]] DOCs as well as the generic ''[[Indicazione geografica tipica]]'' designation of Toscana IGT. Moscadello di Montalcino is a [[sweetness of wine|sweet]] white wine made from [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]]. The style was once widely produced in Montalcino but fell out of style following World War II. In the early 1980s, the wine estate of [[Castello Banfi]] attempted to revive the style by planting Muscat. The Sant'Antimo DOC was named for the [[St. Antimo's Abbey|9th century abbey]] built by [[Charlemagne]]. In the 1970s, producers in Montalcino were influenced by the success of the \"[[Super Tuscan]]\" style of wine that was gaining international recognition for [[Chianti]] producers who deviated from DOC regulations with [[winemaking]] techniques such blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. In 1996, Italian authorities approved the Sant'Antimo DOC to allow Montalcino producers to produce DOC designated wines that were not 100% Sangiovese. These wines include blended ''Bianco'' and ''Rosso'' wines as well as varietally labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, [[Chardonnay]], Merlot, [[Pinot grigio]], [[Pinot nero]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]].<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n===Rosso di Montalcino===\n[[File:Rosso di Montalcino.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A Rosso di Montalcino made from 100% Sangiovese in the Brunello di Montalcino region.]]\nThe Rosso di Montalcino DOC was established in 1984 as a means of giving Brunello di Montalcino producers the flexibility to continue the tradition of long aging of the region's flagship wine. Rosso di Montalcino is made from 100% Sangiovese grown in the same delineated region as Brunello di Montalcino. However, the wine is required to spend only six months aging in oak and 1 year total aging before release. This allows Brunello producers to make an earlier releasing wine that can generate cash flow while their Brunello di Montalcino age for their complete duration. In less than ideal vintages some producers will relegate all their grapes to Rosso di Montalcino production and not make a Brunello. Wineries can also declassify their Brunello that has already been aging 2\u20133 years and release it as Rosso di Montalcino if the wine is not developing to their expectations. Rosso di Montalcino is typically lighter, fresher and more approachable upon release though some producers will make wines with more Brunello like characteristics. These \"Baby Brunellos\" are often 1/3 to 1/2 the price of Brunello di Montalcino.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 159-163\"/>\n\n==Vintage quality evaluation==\nThe Consorzio del Vino Brunello di Montalcino classifies every year the new wine production, in order to rate the Montalcino harvest and its wines Brunello di Montalcino, Rosso di Montalcino, Moscadello di Montalcino and Sant\u2019Antimo.\nThe evaluation takes place every January, by having wine samples of the latest harvest undergo chemical/physical and organoleptic analyses.\nThe Tasting Committee is composed up of 20 technicians operating in Montalcino, with extensive experience in the production of this area.\nThe evaluation is expressed in stars, corresponding to the following classification:\n- insufficent vintage (one star)\n- fair vintage (two stars)\n- good vintage (three stars)\n- exellent vintage (four stars)\n- outstanding vintage (five stars)\n\nThe declaration of the stars assigned to the vintage takes place in February each year, as part of the event \"BENVENUTO BRUNELLO\".<ref>[https://www.consorziobrunellodimontalcino.it/en/583/wines '''Consorzio Del Vino Brunello di Montalcino''', Vintage Quality Evaluation]</ref>\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brunello Di Montalcino}}\n[[Category:Italian DOCG]]\n[[Category:Wines of Tuscany]]\n", "name_user": "Vasssi", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunello_di_Montalcino"}

For political reasons its members distinguished themselves from the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) as \"German [[Fascism|Fascists]]\".

Seldte joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour, prevailing against Duesterberg. ''Der Stahlhelm'' still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|German federal election]] of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative \"Black-White-Red Struggle Front\" (''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'') with the DNVP and the [[Agricultural League]], reaching 8% of the votes.\n\nOn 27 March 1933, a SA raid with the intention of disarmament of ''Stahlhelm'' members in [[Braunschweig]], who under the command of [[Werner Schrader]] had forged an alliance with scattered Republican ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]]'' forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister [[Dietrich Klagges]] and later called ''Der Stahlhelm Putsch'' was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on ''Der Stahlhelm'' in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally [[monarchist]] character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nOn 27 April 1933, Seldte had officially declared ''Der Stahlhelm'' subordinate to Hitler's command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate ''Der Stahlhelm'' succeeded in 1934 in the course of the \"voluntary\" ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process: the organization was renamed ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)'' ({{lang-en|National Socialist German Combatants' Federation (Stahlhelm)}}) (NSDFBSt) while large parts were merged into the SA as ''Wehrstahlhelm'', ''Reserve I'' and ''Reserve II'' contingents. The remaining NSDFBSt local groups were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on 7 November 1935. Seldte's rival Duesterberg was interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] upon the [[Night of the Long Knives]] at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\n{{See also|Service Entry Badge of Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|label 1=Service Entry Badge}}\n[[File:Stahlhelm (N&H) obverse 1.JPG|thumb|''Der Stahlhelm'' lapel pin, 1918\u20131933]]\n* Wehrmann\n* Oberwehrmann\n* Stabswehrmann\n* Gruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Feldmeister\n* Oberfeldmeister\n* Zugf\u00fchrer\n* Oberzugf\u00fchrer\n* Kompanief\u00fchrer\n* Bataillonsf\u00fchrer\n* Stabsf\u00fchrer\n* Regimentsf\u00fchrer\n* Brigadef\u00fchrer\n* Divisionsf\u00fchrer\n* Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Bundeshauptmann\n* Bundesf\u00fchrer\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Tauber |first=Kurt |year=1967 |title=[[Beyond Eagle and Swastika]]: German Nationalism Since 1945 |location=Middletown, Conn. |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n<!--\n  ===============================================================================\n   WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

''Der Stahlhelm'' still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|German federal election]] of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative \"Black-White-Red Struggle Front\" (''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'') with the DNVP and the [[Agricultural League]], reaching 8% of the votes. On 27 March 1933, a SA raid with the intention of disarmament of ''Stahlhelm'' members in [[Braunschweig]], who under the command of [[Werner Schrader]] had forged an alliance with scattered Republican ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]]'' forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister [[Dietrich Klagges]] and later called ''Der Stahlhelm Putsch'' was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on ''Der Stahlhelm'' in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally [[monarchist]] character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nOn 27 April 1933, Seldte had officially declared ''Der Stahlhelm'' subordinate to Hitler's command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate ''Der Stahlhelm'' succeeded in 1934 in the course of the \"voluntary\" ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process: the organization was renamed ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)'' ({{lang-en|National Socialist German Combatants' Federation (Stahlhelm)}}) (NSDFBSt) while large parts were merged into the SA as ''Wehrstahlhelm'', ''Reserve I'' and ''Reserve II'' contingents. The remaining NSDFBSt local groups were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on 7 November 1935. Seldte's rival Duesterberg was interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] upon the [[Night of the Long Knives]] at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\n{{See also|Service Entry Badge of Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|label 1=Service Entry Badge}}\n[[File:Stahlhelm (N&H) obverse 1.JPG|thumb|''Der Stahlhelm'' lapel pin, 1918\u20131933]]\n* Wehrmann\n* Oberwehrmann\n* Stabswehrmann\n* Gruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Feldmeister\n* Oberfeldmeister\n* Zugf\u00fchrer\n* Oberzugf\u00fchrer\n* Kompanief\u00fchrer\n* Bataillonsf\u00fchrer\n* Stabsf\u00fchrer\n* Regimentsf\u00fchrer\n* Brigadef\u00fchrer\n* Divisionsf\u00fchrer\n* Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Bundeshauptmann\n* Bundesf\u00fchrer\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Tauber |first=Kurt |year=1967 |title=[[Beyond Eagle and Swastika]]: German Nationalism Since 1945 |location=Middletown, Conn. |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n<!--\n  ===============================================================================\n   WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

The aircraft was specially prepared for these flights. It had 80 seats in first class, thus providing passengers with ample room for their comfort. Eighty tourists were selected for a 31-day tour that included visits to the main cities of Africa, Asia and Oceania.

The season began on 6 August 2011 and will end at a yet unknown date in 2012, with a winter break beginning on 8 December 2011.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[FK Mogren|Mogren]] are the defending champions.\n\n== Teams ==\n[[OFK Bar|Bar]] were directly relegated to the Montenegrin Second League after finishing 12th at the end of [[2010\u201311 Montenegrin First League|last season]]; the club returned to the second level after just one year. Their place was taken by 2010\u201311 [[Montenegrin Second League|Second League]] champions [[FK Bokelj|Bokelj]], who returned to the top league of Montenegro after an absence of three seasons.\n\n10th-placed [[FK Mornar|Mornar]] and 11th-placed [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] had to compete in two-legged relegation play-offs. Sutjeska kept their place in the First League by beating Second League runners-up [[FK Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje|Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje]] 1\u20130 on aggregate. On the other hand, Mornar were relegated after losing to Second League third-placed team [[FK Berane]] on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]; the two-leg affair ended 1\u20131. Berane thus made their immediate return to the league, while Mornar were relegated after two seasons in the top flight.\n\n===Stadia and locations===\n{{Location
