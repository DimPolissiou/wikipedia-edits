In the [[Judiciary of Belgium|Belgian criminal justice system]], an assize court is a non-permanent court that holds [[jury trial]]s on the most serious crimes. A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected. For the [[jury selection]], 200 Belgian citizens were summoned to the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice of Brussels]], where the assize trial is held. A significant number of them asked to be exempt from [[jury duty]] for various reasons. After a dozen of juror candidates were [[Peremptory challenge|challenged]] by both the defence and the prosecution, eight men and four women were eventually empaneled as jurors. An additional twelve people, of which three men and nine women, were also selected as alternate jurors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/01/07/ik-ben-rondgeleid-door-een-slachtoffer-ik-ben-half-doof-of/|title=\"Rondleiding door slachtoffer\", \"half doof\" of \"skivakantie\": excuses om niet in jury proces-Nemmouche te moeten zitten|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|date=7 January 2019|work=www.vrt.be|access-date=8 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107202800/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/01/07/ik-ben-rondgeleid-door-een-slachtoffer-ik-ben-half-doof-of/|archive-date=7 January 2019|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=\"Guided tour by victim\", \"half deaf\" or \"skiing holiday\": excuses not to have to serve on the jury in Nemmouche trial}}</ref>\n\nHenri Laquay, the lawyer of Nemmouche, argued that Nemmouche was innocent and that he had been set up by Israeli intelligence and Belgian police.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. An eyewitness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] and [[eyewitness testimony]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] from 2012 to 2014, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented that the defence did not bring forward any element that would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==== Nacer Bendrer ====\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons and ammunitions Nemmouche used. According to Belgian law, being the co-author of a crime means that one's aid was indispensable in the commission of the crime, i.e. that the crime would not have happened without this aid. The verdict stated Bendrer was aware of Nemmouche's [[Radicalization|radicalisation]] and adherence to [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist beliefs]] from when they got to know each other in 2008, during their incarceration in [[Salon-de-Provence]], France. Telephone data showed that, after having had no contact for four years, Nemmouche sought contact again with Bendrer on 9 April 2014, after which Bendrer traveled to Brussels a few days later. After numerous contacts since, Nemmouche traveled to Bendrer's hometown [[Marseille]], France on 24 April 2014, and telephone data pinpointed him in the area of Bendrer's home around that time. After Nemmouche's return to Brussels, all contact ceased between them two. Investigators testified they took steps to hide their communications and encounters, by for example switching between multiple phone numbers and [[SIM card|SIM cards]].<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe jury concluded their encounters could only have served to provide Nemmouche with weapons, because of the absence of any other plausible reason Bendrer had to travel to Brussels, because of the absence of any other source where Nemmouche could have procured the weapons from, and because Bendrer had later also admitted to investigators to have supplied Nemmouche with the weapons. As to the defence's argument that Bendrer did not know to which crime he would contribute, the jury retorted that Bendrer wilfully omitted to inform himself. The jury found that Bendrer should have known the weapons would be used to perform a terrorist act, based on their nature and based on the radicalisation of Nemmouche that Bendrer was aware of.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\n[[File:Cour d'assises Bruxelles 12 mars 2019.pdf|thumb|150px|Sentencing judgment (in French)]]\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any Islamic extremism since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Damages ===\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. An eyewitness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] and [[eyewitness testimony]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] from 2012 to 2014, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented that the defence did not bring forward any element that would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==== Nacer Bendrer ====\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons and ammunitions Nemmouche used. According to Belgian law, being the co-author of a crime means that one's aid was indispensable in the commission of the crime, i.e. that the crime would not have happened without this aid. The verdict stated Bendrer was aware of Nemmouche's [[Radicalization|radicalisation]] and adherence to [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist beliefs]] from when they got to know each other in 2008, during their incarceration in [[Salon-de-Provence]], France. Telephone data showed that, after having had no contact for four years, Nemmouche sought contact again with Bendrer on 9 April 2014, after which Bendrer traveled to Brussels a few days later. After numerous contacts since, Nemmouche traveled to Bendrer's hometown [[Marseille]], France on 24 April 2014, and telephone data pinpointed him in the area of Bendrer's home around that time. After Nemmouche's return to Brussels, all contact ceased between them two. Investigators testified they took steps to hide their communications and encounters, by for example switching between multiple phone numbers and [[SIM card|SIM cards]].<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe jury concluded their encounters could only have served to provide Nemmouche with weapons, because of the absence of any other plausible reason Bendrer had to travel to Brussels, because of the absence of any other source where Nemmouche could have procured the weapons from, and because Bendrer had later also admitted to investigators to have supplied Nemmouche with the weapons. As to the defence's argument that Bendrer did not know to which crime he would contribute, the jury retorted that Bendrer wilfully omitted to inform himself. The jury found that Bendrer should have known the weapons would be used to perform a terrorist act, based on their nature and based on the radicalisation of Nemmouche that Bendrer was aware of.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any Islamic extremism since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Damages ===\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite

In the following season, Philadelphia coach [[Alex Hannum]] instructed Chamberlain to provide an increased focus on playing a team game, to avoid drawing the double-teams that troubled Chamberlain during the Finals. This tactical change brought the team to a new record of 68 wins the following season, as well as defeating the Celtics before winning the 1967 Finals. In 1968, Boston overcame a 3\u20131 deficit against Philadelphia to once again arrive in the Finals. They went on to defeat the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Finals to again become NBA champions.\n\nIn 1969, the Celtics faced great difficulty entering the postseason, as they had an aging team and multiple injuries to a number of players. They qualified for the playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the East, while the Lakers, who had added Chamberlain in the off-season to join stars [[Jerry West]] and [[Elgin Baylor]], won the West and were prohibitive favorites to become champions for the first time since relocating to Los Angeles. Despite holding a 2\u20131 advantage going into Game 4, the Lakers led 87\u201386 and had the ball with 10 seconds to play. But after a turnover, [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] scored to give the Celtics a narrow 88\u201387 win and tying the series. The series was eventually tied 3\u20133 going into Game 7 in Los Angeles, with Lakers owner [[Jack Kent Cooke|Jack Cooke]] hanging balloons in the arena in anticipation of a Lakers victory. West also picked up injuries to his thigh and hamstring during the series, but returned to play for the final game. Russell utilized this newly lacking mobility in West to organize fast breaks at every opportunity for the Celtics, which allowed them to gain an early lead. They held off a furious Lakers comeback to win 108\u2013106 and win the series, and win their eleventh championship in 13 years.\n\nAs many stars either declined or retired following this win, it is largely recognized as the last NBA Finals conducted by the Celtics dynasty.\n\n===1970\u20131979: Decade of parity===\nThe 1970s saw eight teams win the title, with the Celtics and [[New York Knicks]] winning twice.\n\nIn [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]], a classic final featured the Knicks against the Lakers. In the waning moments of Game 3, with the series tied, [[Jerry West]] hit a basket from 60 feet to tie the game, a shot which became one of the most famous ever. However, the Knicks won in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] and continued their momentum for a 4\u20133 win, becoming the first team after the Celtics dynasty to win an NBA championship. The [[Milwaukee Bucks]] also won their first title, defeating the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in 1971.\n\nTwo seasons after losing in the Finals, the Lakers won 33 straight games, the longest such streak in NBA history. By season's end, they broke the record for most wins in a season with 69, one more than the [[1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers season|1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers]], before taking home the [[1972 NBA Finals|championship]] for the first time since relocating to [[Los Angeles]]. The Knicks returned to win the Finals again a season later, their second championship.\n\nDespite the rise of the Knicks, the [[1974 NBA Finals|1974 championship]] returned to the Celtics.\n\nFollowing the success of the Lakers, the 1970s were characterized by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48\u201334 regular season record, the [[Golden State Warriors]] swept the [[Washington Bullets]] 4\u20130 in the [[1975 NBA Finals]]. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, after only eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42\u201340. They achieved upset victories over the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes and Boston won 128\u2013126. The Celtics quickly managed to secure their 13th championship, defeating the Suns 87\u201380 in Game 6.\n\nOther franchises that won their first titles in the 1970s included the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in 1977, and the Washington Bullets, who defeated the SuperSonics in 1978. The SuperSonics managed to exact revenge on the Bullets the following season, as they won their first title in 1979.\n\n===1980\u20131990: Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry and the Bad Boys===\n[[File:1985 Finals Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|left|The 1980s saw a renewal in the rivalry between the [[Boston Celtics]] (green) and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (gold), combining to win eight titles.]]\nBetween 1980 and 1990, the Celtics, 76ers, Lakers, or the [[Detroit Pistons]] won every NBA Finals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} From 1980 to 1990, the Lakers won five titles (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988); the Celtics won three (1981, 1984, and 1986); the Pistons won twice (1989 and 1990); and the 76ers won once (1983).\n\nThe [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] featured [[Magic Johnson]]'s [[Michigan State University]] team facing off against [[Larry Bird]]'s [[Indiana State University]] team. This meeting has been immortalized as the beginning of the Lakers and Celtics rivalry of the 1980s, which pitted those two NBA teams represented respectively by Johnson and Bird. It also attracted the largest TV rating ever for an NCAA Championship game, as 38 percent of all television viewers that night tuned in.\n\nBird had actually been drafted the year before, but later decided to stay an additional year, and the two superstars both entered the league in 1979, leading their respective teams to dazzling heights. Johnson and the [[Showtime Lakers]] reached the [[1980 NBA Finals]] against the 76ers, which were also led by NBA superstar [[Julius Erving]]. The Lakers took a 3\u20132 lead, but [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center, and ended up playing every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/magiccenter_moments.html|title=NBA.com: Magic Fills in at Center|work=nba.com|accessdate=29 June 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67no8WnjY?url=http://www.nba.com/history/magiccenter_moments.html|archive-date=May 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> to win his first championship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable performance in the annals of the sport.\n\nBoston reached the [[1981 NBA Finals]] led by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]]. During the [[1980 NBA draft]], the Celtics traded two first round picks to the Warriors for Parish and a first round pick later spent on McHale. Considered to be one of the best front courts of all time, all three players later made the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.<ref>[[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]</ref> They met the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1981 Finals, practically single-handedly carried by [[Moses Malone]], who upset the Lakers and Johnson in the first round. The Rockets were only the second team in NBA history to make the Finals after posting a losing record in the regular season, and the Celtics had an NBA best record of 62\u201320. The Celtics later won the Finals in 6 games.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the NBA Finals in [[1982 NBA Finals|1982]], this time led by new coach [[Pat Riley]], in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games, with Johnson being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three NBA Finals appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more piece to become champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September 15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.\n\nWith the new duo of Malone and Erving, the 76ers won the [[1983 NBA Finals]], losing only once in the entire playoffs, as well as sweeping the Lakers. The [[1984 NBA Finals]] was contested by the Celtics and Lakers, who faced each other for the first time since 1969. After an inspired performance from Bird, the Celtics toppled the Lakers 4\u20133. The final game of this series attracted the largest ever TV audience for an NBA game, and the second-largest ever for a basketball game, with only the game between the two stars played five years earlier having a larger audience. It was the last NBA Finals played in the 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format, until 2014.\n\nIn the [[1985 NBA Finals]], the Lakers made amends for their previous eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games. Although the Lakers lost the first game by 34 points in the [[Memorial Day Massacre]], they won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the [[Boston Garden]]. These finals were the first to be played in the 2\u20133\u20132 format, which was suggested by Boston coach [[Red Auerbach]] to NBA commissioner [[David Stern]], as he hoped to cut back on the frequent traveling from Boston to Los Angeles.\n\nThe [[1986 NBA Finals]] saw the Celtics face off against the Rockets, with Boston winning in six games, securing their 16th title. Bird was named Finals MVP for the second time. In [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]], the Lakers and Celtics met again. The Lakers won the first two games, but Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, Johnson hit a hook shot with two seconds left to give the Lakers a 107\u2013106 win and a 3\u20131 series lead. The Lakers lost Game 5, but eventually won Game 6 to clinch the series, and a 2\u20131 win against the Celtics. Johnson was named Finals MVP for the third time.\n\nIn the following two seasons, the aging Celtics failed to reach the Finals, becoming overshadowed by the rise of the [[Detroit Pistons]]. The Lakers managed to defend their title in the [[1988 NBA Finals|1988 Finals]], winning the series in 7 games against the Pistons. They then became the first team to win back-to-back NBA titles since 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/nba-season-recaps/index.html|title=NBA Season Recaps|date=1 July 2014|work=NBA.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> Seeking a three-peat in [[1989 NBA Finals|1989]], the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. In [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]], the Pistons then went back-to-back after defeating the [[Clyde Drexler]] led Portland Trail Blazers in five games, attaining the nickname \"Bad Boys\" due to its rough, physical play. Led by a Hall of Fame back court in [[Joe Dumars]] and [[Isiah Thomas]] and a rugged front court in [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Bill Laimbeer]], the Pistons attained great success.\n\n===1991\u20131998: Bulls dynasty===\n<!-- Do NOT add the Rockets or \"Clutch City\" to the title -->\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Michael Jordan]] combined with [[Scottie Pippen]] and coach [[Phil Jackson]] to win six NBA championships.|alt=]]\nThe majority of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the [[Chicago Bulls]]. The Bulls, led by head coach [[Phil Jackson]] and star players [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]], won six titles in six Finals appearances from 1991 to 1998. The only other team to win a title during this time was the [[Houston Rockets]] who won titles in 1994 and 1995, during Jordan's first retirement from professional basketball.\n\nThe first championship came at the expense of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], which also saw the last appearance in the Finals for [[Magic Johnson]]. Billed{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as a showdown between the aging Johnson and the upstart Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93\u201391. For the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan a free scoring, and Chicago won the next four games. The Bulls returned to the Finals the next year, pitted against [[Clyde Drexler]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Throughout the 1991\u20131992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records in their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the two players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointers in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18\u2013[[Scottie Pippen|7]] in the final period to win the game, even with Drexler fouling out in the 4th quarter. Games 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and Portland, respectively, but the Bulls won the final two games, clinching their second championship.\n\nIn 1993, Jordan was matched against close friend [[Charles Barkley]], who was the league's reigning MVP of the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Bulls won the first two games in Phoenix, 100\u201392 and 111\u2013108. The Suns, rallying behind Barkley, won Game 3, 129\u2013121 in Chicago in triple overtime. The Bulls won Game 4, 111\u2013105, with Jordan scoring 55 points and tying [[Rick Barry]] for the second-most points in an NBA Finals game. The Suns won Game 5, 108\u201398, sending the series back to Phoenix. Chicago clinched the series in Game 6, 99\u201398, on [[John Paxson]]'s three-pointer, as the Bulls became the third team in history to [[three-peat]]. After this win, Jordan retired from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.\n\nFollowing Jordan's departure, the [[Houston Rockets]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this time, Olajuwon became the only player in history to win the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP]], [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] and Finals MVP awards in the same season. That was the only year that both the NBA and [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|NHL Finals]] went to seven games, with the Rockets facing the [[New York Knicks]] in 1994. With their win in Game 7, the Rockets denied New York from winning both the NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the [[New York Rangers]] won the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals]]. After trading for [[Clyde Drexler]] midseason, the Rockets later swept an [[Orlando Magic]] team consisting of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] in the 1995 Finals; Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP, and the Rockets became the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles and became the first 6th-seeded team to win the title without enjoying home court advantage on any of their playoff series. The Houston Rockets also beat teams with at least 50 regular season wins in every round of the playoffs, with \"Road Court\" advantage. No other team in NBA History has done that. The Houston Rockets were down 3 games to 1 to the Phoenix Suns in the Semi-Finals and won 2 out of 3 games on the road, including game 7 to advance to the Conference Finals.\n\nAfter his short stint with baseball, Jordan returned to basketball late in the 1994\u201395 season. Although he did not lead the Bulls to the Finals for that season, he returned to pre-retirement form the next season while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion [[Dennis Rodman]]. The [[1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls season|1995\u201396 Bulls]] finished the regular season 72\u201310, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history. They dominated in the playoffs, with series records of 3\u20130, 4\u20131 and 4\u20130, before facing the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the NBA Finals. After the Bulls took a 3\u20130 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after coach [[George Karl]] switched point guard [[Gary Payton]] onto Jordan, leading to a sixth game. Jordan altered his game to deal with Payton, and the Bulls won Game 6 to win their fourth title.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the [[Utah Jazz]] in the Finals twice. Led by [[Dream Team (basketball)|Dream Team]] Olympians [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]], the Jazz were defeated in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning shots in the sixth game, the first by [[Steve Kerr]] in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and winning their second three-peat. Before the lockout shortened 1998&ndash;99 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted in most of the team, including Jordan and Pippen, leaving the Bulls. With no foundation of youth to build upon, the Bulls became a [[NBA Draft Lottery|lottery-bound]] team for the next six seasons.\n\n===1999\u20132010: Lakers' & Spurs' dominance===\n[[File:Kobe Bryant 8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kobe Bryant]] was a member of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] that won five NBA championships from 2000 to 2010.]]\nThe [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]] combined to win nine NBA Championships during this period.\n\nThe Spurs were responsible for winning four championships during this time, in 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs finished with a 15\u20132 mark, including sweeps of the Blazers and Lakers. With a defensive squad led by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Tim Duncan]], San Antonio's 84.7 points allowed per game was the fewest average points allowed in the postseason in the last 30 years. In the [[1999 NBA Finals|Finals]] that year, the Spurs held the [[New York Knicks]], the first #8 seed team to reach the finals in NBA history, to an average of 79.8 points per game. During the [[2003 NBA Finals]], the Spurs defeated the New Jersey Nets in 6 games, which also marked the first championship contested between two former ABA teams. In Game 6, Duncan was two blocks short of recording the first [[quadruple-double]] in NBA Finals history, finishing with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks. The Spurs went on to defeat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 4\u20133 in the [[2005 NBA Finals]], as well as sweeping the [[LeBron James]]-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in the [[2007 NBA Finals]]. Duncan won the Finals MVP in 1999, 2003 and 2005. In 2007, [[Tony Parker]] was named MVP, becoming the first European-born player to win the award.\n\n[[File:Tim Duncan.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Tim Duncan]] won five championships with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] from 1999 to 2014.]]\nFrom 2000 to 2002, the Lakers, led by [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], won three straight NBA Championships. O'Neal won the finals MVP all three times. Their [[2000 NBA Finals|first championship]] came at the expense of the [[Indiana Pacers]], whom the Lakers defeated in 6 games. During their [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] postseason run, the Lakers swept their first 3 series and won the Finals in 5 games, finishing with an unprecedented 15\u20131 record, the best postseason record in NBA history at the time. Their opponent in the Finals that year were the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], led by [[Allen Iverson]]. In the [[2002 NBA Finals]], the Lakers swept the [[New Jersey Nets]], leading almost the entire time in each game; only for a short while after the beginning of Game 4 did the [[New Jersey Nets]] gain any significant lead in any game.\n\nIn the 2003 off-season, veteran stars [[Gary Payton]] and [[Karl Malone]] signed with the Lakers. Along with Bryant and O'Neal, they formed what many expected to be one of the best teams in NBA history, and were the favorites to win the championship in 2004. However, the [[Detroit Pistons]], under coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], defeated the Lakers in 5 games. [[Chauncey Billups]] was named the Finals MVP. Now established as one of the powerhouses of the East, the Pistons returned to the NBA Finals the following year, before losing to the Spurs in seven games.\n\nThe [[2006 NBA Finals]] were the only Finals during this time not to feature the Spurs or Lakers, instead featuring the [[Miami Heat]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]]. It was the first NBA Finals since 1971 that had both Western and Eastern Conference champions making their first Finals appearance in franchise history. The Mavericks won the first two games at home, but the turning point of the series was in Game 3, when the Heat overcame a 13-point deficit with less than 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter to win 98\u201396. The comeback was led by [[Dwyane Wade]]'s 12 points in the final six minutes and a clutch outside jumpshot by [[Gary Payton]], who was appearing in his third NBA finals. Miami won all three of their home games, two of which were sparked by fourth quarter comebacks led by Wade; the Heat won their first championship in game six. Wade was awarded the Finals MVP award.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the finals in 2008, against the [[Boston Celtics]]. Renewing the teams' rivalry, this marked the 11th time that these two teams met in the Finals, the last meeting happened in 1987. The Celtics, who defeated the Lakers 4\u20132, were led by their \"Big Three\" superstars of [[Ray Allen]], [[Kevin Garnett]], and [[Paul Pierce]], who was also named Finals MVP.\n\nThe Lakers bounced back from their 2008 loss and returned to the Finals in 2009, where they faced the [[Orlando Magic]], led by [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] [[Dwight Howard]] in 2009. The Lakers defeated Orlando in five games, with Bryant earning the Finals MVP award. The Lakers met the Celtics once again in {{nbafy|2010}}, trailing 3\u20132 before winning the last two at home, marking the first time in the history of the Celtics that they lost a Game 7 in the NBA Finals. Bryant was named Finals MVP, with the triumphs in 2009 and 2010 becoming [[Phil Jackson]]'s 10th and 11th NBA titles. With these championship victories, Jackson surpassed [[Red Auerbach]]'s record for most NBA titles of all time. He also passed Auerbach's and [[National Hockey League]] coach [[Scotty Bowman]]'s record for most titles as head coach in any major American professional sport.\n\n===2011\u20132014: Heat wave===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = LeBron James vs Washington 3-30-11.jpg\n| width1 = 129\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dwyane Wade e1.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Chris Bosh e1.jpg\n| width3 = 111\n| footer = [[LeBron James]] (left) and [[Chris Bosh]] (right) joined [[Dwyane Wade]] (center) at the [[Miami Heat]] to form the [[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]].\n}}\n\nDuring the 2010 off-season, the [[Miami Heat]] re-signed team captain [[Dwyane Wade]] and added free agents [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] to form their [[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2248714-lebron-james-and-the-ghost-of-23|title=LeBron James and the Ghost of 23|author=Team Stream Now|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> The Heat were then considered the favorites by many to win multiple championships.

The Mavericks, led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Jason Terry]], [[Tyson Chandler]], and [[Jason Kidd]], won the series 4\u20132, with Nowitzki being named the Finals MVP. The Heat returned to the finals in the [[2012 NBA Finals|following year]] against an [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] team featuring future MVPs [[Russell Westbrook]], [[James Harden]], and 3-time [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|NBA scoring leader]] [[Kevin Durant]]. After the Thunder won Game 1 at home, the Heat won four straight games to win the series 4\u20131, becoming the first team to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series. James won his first championship and was unanimously named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThe Heat repeated as champions in 2013, this time over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], with the finals being the first since 1987 to feature four former Finals MVPs in the Finals; with [[Tim Duncan]] (1999, 2003, 2005) and [[Tony Parker]] (2007) for the Spurs, and Wade (2006) and James (2012) for the Heat. The Spurs went up 3\u20132 in the series, but the Heat bounced back with a Game 6 victory, notable for a game-tying three-pointer by [[Ray Allen]] in the closing seconds of regulation to send the game into overtime.

The Cavs also traded for [[Kevin Love]] to form a new \"Big Three\" in Cleveland. In the [[2015 NBA Playoffs|2015 postseason]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] were eliminated in the first round while the other 2014 finalist [[Miami Heat|Heat]] failed to qualify for the playoffs. Golden State, spearheaded by 2014\u201315 [[NBA MVP|MVP]] [[Stephen Curry]], achieved a 67\u201315 record and managed to take the West, while the Cavs won the East as James, along with [[James Jones (basketball player)|James Jones]] who played for both the Heat and Cavaliers, made their fifth straight finals appearance \u2013 the first two players to do so since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors defied conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Cavs were without star Love due to an injury suffered earlier in the playoffs, and also lost Irving to injury in a Game 1 overtime loss in the [[2015 NBA Finals]]. James rallied the Cavaliers to win Games 2 and 3, but the Warriors won the next three games after coach [[Steve Kerr]] made the adjustment of inserting the sixth man [[Andre Iguodala]] into the starting lineup in place of center [[Andrew Bogut]], thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors won the title, with Iguodala becoming the first player to win the Finals MVP award without starting a regular season game that season.\n\nDuring the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]], the Warriors broke the record for most wins in a season with a record of 73\u20139 and Curry won his second straight MVP award, as well as becoming the first unanimous MVP in history and shattering his own record for three-pointers made in a single season by over one hundred in the process. The Warriors fell to a 3\u20131 deficit in the Western Conference Finals against a [[Kevin Durant]]-led Oklahoma City Thunder team, but won three straight elimination games to take the series and advance to a second straight Finals. The Cavaliers finished the season as the top seed in the Eastern Conference and won their first 10 straight playoff games, ultimately defeating the [[Toronto Raptors]] 4\u20132 in the Eastern Conference Finals to ensure the rematch of last year's Finals. In the [[2016 NBA Finals]], the Warriors got out to a 3\u20131 lead, but James and Irving led the Cavs to two straight victories to force a deciding Game 7. In a key sequence with two minutes remaining in Game 7, LeBron James made a memorable [[The Block (basketball)|chase-down block]] on Iguodala to keep the game tied, while Irving hit a 3-point shot a minute later to take the lead. Cleveland managed to hold on to the lead to win the title and end the city's [[Cleveland sports curse|52-year championship drought]], with James earning his third Finals MVP honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2647242-cleveland-cavaliers-vs-golden-state-warriors-live-score-analysis-for-game-7|title=NBA Finals Live: Cavs vs. Warriors in Game 7|last=Johnson|first=Jared|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=June 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016 off-season, the Warriors acquired Durant through free agency. After finishing 67\u201315, they became the first team in history to win 67+ games in three straight seasons, they went to the Finals with a 12\u20130 sweep of the West, the first team to do so since the first round changed to best-of-seven in 2003. Meanwhile, though the Cavaliers slipped to the second seed going into the playoffs, they only lost one game en route to defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, setting up another match against the Warriors in the [[2017 NBA Finals]]. The Warriors started strong with a 3\u20130 lead over the Cavs, eventually winning the series in five games with Durant being named Finals MVP.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/powered-kevin-durant-warriors-roll-second-nba-title-three-years-035045798.html|title=Powered by Kevin Durant, Warriors roll to second NBA title in three years|access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> The Warriors set a playoffs record of 15 consecutive wins and a 16\u20131 final record, as well as a 13.5-point differential in the Finals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/g-o-t-grade-definitive-proof-2017-warriors-greatest-team-time-132941191.html|title=G.O.A.T.

Neither Cleveland nor Golden State earned the top playoff seed in the 2017\u201318 season. Both teams fell to 3\u20132 deficits in their respective Conference Finals, before both winning Game 7s to ensure the rematch for a fourth consecutive Finals in [[2018 NBA Finals|2018]]. LeBron James appeared in his eighth consecutive NBA Finals since 2011, four each with the Heat and the Cavaliers. The Warriors went on to sweep the Cavaliers, and Durant was again named Finals MVP.\n\nIn 2018, James left the Cavaliers and signed with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Without James, the Cavaliers struggled and did not return to the playoffs. The Warriors continued their success and reached their fifth straight Finals in [[2019 NBA Finals|2019]], becoming the first team since the 1960s Celtics to make it to five straight Finals, and the first Western Conference team to ever do so. The Warriors were then defeated by the [[Toronto Raptors]], 4\u20132, resulting in the Raptors' first championship and the first NBA title for a team based in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26969391/raptors-top-warriors-1st-title-team-history|title=Raptors top Warriors for 1st title in team history|access-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref> The Raptors' [[Kawhi Leonard]] was named Finals MVP, becoming the first player to win the award while representing teams from both conferences, having previously won it with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 2014.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nAs part of a multiyear partnership that began in 2018, the internet television service [[YouTube TV]] became the [[Title sponsor|presenting sponsor]] of the NBA Finals.<ref name=\"USAToday20180326\">{{cite news|title=NBA, YouTube TV announce first-ever partnership for 2018 Finals|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/03/26/nba-youtube-tv-announce-first-ever-partnership-2018-finals/458026002/|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{{Main|List of NBA champions}}\n\n==Team records==\n\n===Finals appearances===\nThe statistics below refer to series wins and losses, not individual games won and lost.

The [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western]] conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion. The winners of the Finals are awarded the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]], which replaced the [[Walter A. Brown Trophy]] in 1983.\n\nThe series was initially known as the '''BAA Finals''' prior to the 1949\u201350 season when the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) merged with the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) to form the NBA. The competition oversaw further name changes to '''NBA World Championship Series''' from 1950 to 1985, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ballard|first=Bill|title=Here Are Some Final Facts on NBA Playoffs|date=June 4, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-04/sports/sp-2773_1_nba-finals-final-facts-20-point-scorer|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XKBuCGP6|archivedate=March 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2018, it has been officially known as the ''NBA Finals presented by [[YouTube TV]]'' for [[Naming rights|sponsorship reasons]].<ref name=\"USAToday20180326\"/>\n\nThe NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format.

The [[Boston Celtics]] hold the record for the most victories, having won the competition 17 times, as well as the most consecutive titles, winning 8 times from 1959 to 1966. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] have contested the NBA Finals the most times, with 31 appearances. The Eastern Conference has provided the most champions, with 38 wins from 10 franchises; the Western Conference has 32, from 9 franchises.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The NBA Finals logo.svg|thumb|right|200px|The previous NBA Finals logo, used until 2017.]]\n\n===1957\u20131969: Celtics dynasty===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bill Russell]] (off ball) was a member of one of the first dynasties in the NBA, winning eight straight titles while contending against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] (on ball).]]\nThe [[Boston Celtics]] went 11\u20131 in the NBA Finals during 13 seasons (1956\u201357 to 1968\u201369). They won eight straight NBA championships from 1959 through 1966.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Celtics History|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/celtics_history.html|publisher=Boston Celtics|accessdate=January 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026022832/http://www.nba.com/celtics/celtics_history.html|archive-date=October 26, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> This period marks the largest stretch of seasons that a single team made up over 65% of Finals appearances, and also includes the [[1957 NBA Finals|only ever time]] the NBA Finals was decided in double overtime.\n\nWith the establishment of the Celtics dynasty in 1957 spearheaded by center [[Bill Russell]], the team saw great success. Despite encountering some difficulty when up against teams led by [[Wilt Chamberlain]], for most of the late 1950s and 1960s, the Celtics and Russell managed to have an upper hand on Chamberlain's teams.\n\nIn 1964, Chamberlain, who had moved to the state of California alongside [[Philadelphia Warriors|his team]], led the [[San Francisco Warriors]] to a Western Conference championship, but again failed to conquer the Celtics. The following season, he returned to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] to join the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], who were the former Syracuse Nationals that had relocated to the city to cover the vacancy created with the departure of the Warriors.\n\nThe first clash between the two stars in the playoffs was in 1966, with Boston winning the series 4\u20131. In the following season, Philadelphia coach [[Alex Hannum]] instructed Chamberlain to provide an increased focus on playing a team game, to avoid drawing the double-teams that troubled Chamberlain during the Finals. This tactical change brought the team to a new record of 68 wins the following season, as well as defeating the Celtics before winning the 1967 Finals. In 1968, Boston overcame a 3\u20131 deficit against Philadelphia to once again arrive in the Finals. They went on to defeat the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Finals to again become NBA champions.\n\nIn 1969, the Celtics faced great difficulty entering the postseason, as they had an aging team and multiple injuries to a number of players. They qualified for the playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the East, while the Lakers, who had added Chamberlain in the off-season to join stars [[Jerry West]] and [[Elgin Baylor]], won the West and were prohibitive favorites to become champions for the first time since relocating to Los Angeles. Despite holding a 2\u20131 advantage going into Game 4, the Lakers led 87\u201386 and had the ball with 10 seconds to play. But after a turnover, [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] scored to give the Celtics a narrow 88\u201387 win and tying the series. The series was eventually tied 3\u20133 going into Game 7 in Los Angeles, with Lakers owner [[Jack Kent Cooke|Jack Cooke]] hanging balloons in the arena in anticipation of a Lakers victory. West also picked up injuries to his thigh and hamstring during the series, but returned to play for the final game. Russell utilized this newly lacking mobility in West to organize fast breaks at every opportunity for the Celtics, which allowed them to gain an early lead. They held off a furious Lakers comeback to win 108\u2013106 and win the series, and win their eleventh championship in 13 years.\n\nAs many stars either declined or retired following this win, it is largely recognized as the last NBA Finals conducted by the Celtics dynasty.\n\n===1970\u20131979: Decade of parity===\nThe 1970s saw eight teams win the title, with the Celtics and [[New York Knicks]] winning twice.\n\nIn [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]], a classic final featured the Knicks against the Lakers. In the waning moments of Game 3, with the series tied, [[Jerry West]] hit a basket from 60 feet to tie the game, a shot which became one of the most famous ever. However, the Knicks won in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] and continued their momentum for a 4\u20133 win, becoming the first team after the Celtics dynasty to win an NBA championship. The [[Milwaukee Bucks]] also won their first title, defeating the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in 1971.\n\nTwo seasons after losing in the Finals, the Lakers won 33 straight games, the longest such streak in NBA history. By season's end, they broke the record for most wins in a season with 69, one more than the [[1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers season|1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers]], before taking home the [[1972 NBA Finals|championship]] for the first time since relocating to [[Los Angeles]]. The Knicks returned to win the Finals again a season later, their second championship.\n\nDespite the rise of the Knicks, the [[1974 NBA Finals|1974 championship]] returned to the Celtics.\n\nFollowing the success of the Lakers, the 1970s were characterized by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48\u201334 regular season record, the [[Golden State Warriors]] swept the [[Washington Bullets]] 4\u20130 in the [[1975 NBA Finals]]. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, after only eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42\u201340. They achieved upset victories over the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes and Boston won 128\u2013126. The Celtics quickly managed to secure their 13th championship, defeating the Suns 87\u201380 in Game 6.\n\nOther franchises that won their first titles in the 1970s included the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in 1977, and the Washington Bullets, who defeated the SuperSonics in 1978. The SuperSonics managed to exact revenge on the Bullets the following season, as they won their first title in 1979.\n\n===1980\u20131990: Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry and the Bad Boys===\n[[File:1985 Finals Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|left|The 1980s saw a renewal in the rivalry between the [[Boston Celtics]] (green) and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (gold), combining to win eight titles.]]\nBetween 1980 and 1990, the Celtics, 76ers, Lakers, or the [[Detroit Pistons]] won every NBA Finals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} From 1980 to 1990, the Lakers won five titles (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988); the Celtics won three (1981, 1984, and 1986); the Pistons won twice (1989 and 1990); and the 76ers won once (1983).\n\nThe [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] featured [[Magic Johnson]]'s [[Michigan State University]] team facing off against [[Larry Bird]]'s [[Indiana State University]] team. This meeting has been immortalized as the beginning of the Lakers and Celtics rivalry of the 1980s, which pitted those two NBA teams represented respectively by Johnson and Bird. It also attracted the largest TV rating ever for an NCAA Championship game, as 38 percent of all television viewers that night tuned in.\n\nBird had actually been drafted the year before, but later decided to stay an additional year, and the two superstars both entered the league in 1979, leading their respective teams to dazzling heights. Johnson and the [[Showtime Lakers]] reached the [[1980 NBA Finals]] against the 76ers, which were also led by NBA superstar [[Julius Erving]]. The Lakers took a 3\u20132 lead, but [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center, and ended up playing every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/magiccenter_moments.html|title=NBA.com: Magic Fills in at Center|work=nba.com|accessdate=29 June 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67no8WnjY?url=http://www.nba.com/history/magiccenter_moments.html|archive-date=May 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> to win his first championship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable performance in the annals of the sport.\n\nBoston reached the [[1981 NBA Finals]] led by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]]. During the [[1980 NBA draft]], the Celtics traded two first round picks to the Warriors for Parish and a first round pick later spent on McHale. Considered to be one of the best front courts of all time, all three players later made the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.<ref>[[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]</ref> They met the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1981 Finals, practically single-handedly carried by [[Moses Malone]], who upset the Lakers and Johnson in the first round. The Rockets were only the second team in NBA history to make the Finals after posting a losing record in the regular season, and the Celtics had an NBA best record of 62\u201320. The Celtics later won the Finals in 6 games.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the NBA Finals in [[1982 NBA Finals|1982]], this time led by new coach [[Pat Riley]], in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games, with Johnson being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three NBA Finals appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more piece to become champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September 15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.\n\nWith the new duo of Malone and Erving, the 76ers won the [[1983 NBA Finals]], losing only once in the entire playoffs, as well as sweeping the Lakers. The [[1984 NBA Finals]] was contested by the Celtics and Lakers, who faced each other for the first time since 1969. After an inspired performance from Bird, the Celtics toppled the Lakers 4\u20133. The final game of this series attracted the largest ever TV audience for an NBA game, and the second-largest ever for a basketball game, with only the game between the two stars played five years earlier having a larger audience. It was the last NBA Finals played in the 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format, until 2014.\n\nIn the [[1985 NBA Finals]], the Lakers made amends for their previous eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games. Although the Lakers lost the first game by 34 points in the [[Memorial Day Massacre]], they won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the [[Boston Garden]]. These finals were the first to be played in the 2\u20133\u20132 format, which was suggested by Boston coach [[Red Auerbach]] to NBA commissioner [[David Stern]], as he hoped to cut back on the frequent traveling from Boston to Los Angeles.\n\nThe [[1986 NBA Finals]] saw the Celtics face off against the Rockets, with Boston winning in six games, securing their 16th title. Bird was named Finals MVP for the second time. In [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]], the Lakers and Celtics met again. The Lakers won the first two games, but Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, Johnson hit a hook shot with two seconds left to give the Lakers a 107\u2013106 win and a 3\u20131 series lead. The Lakers lost Game 5, but eventually won Game 6 to clinch the series, and a 2\u20131 win against the Celtics. Johnson was named Finals MVP for the third time.\n\nIn the following two seasons, the aging Celtics failed to reach the Finals, becoming overshadowed by the rise of the [[Detroit Pistons]]. The Lakers managed to defend their title in the [[1988 NBA Finals|1988 Finals]], winning the series in 7 games against the Pistons. They then became the first team to win back-to-back NBA titles since 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/nba-season-recaps/index.html|title=NBA Season Recaps|date=1 July 2014|work=NBA.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> Seeking a three-peat in [[1989 NBA Finals|1989]], the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. In [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]], the Pistons then went back-to-back after defeating the [[Clyde Drexler]] led Portland Trail Blazers in five games, attaining the nickname \"Bad Boys\" due to its rough, physical play. Led by a Hall of Fame back court in [[Joe Dumars]] and [[Isiah Thomas]] and a rugged front court in [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Bill Laimbeer]], the Pistons attained great success.\n\n===1991\u20131998: Bulls dynasty===\n<!-- Do NOT add the Rockets or \"Clutch City\" to the title -->\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Michael Jordan]] combined with [[Scottie Pippen]] and coach [[Phil Jackson]] to win six NBA championships.|alt=]]\nThe majority of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the [[Chicago Bulls]]. The Bulls, led by head coach [[Phil Jackson]] and star players [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]], won six titles in six Finals appearances from 1991 to 1998. The only other team to win a title during this time was the [[Houston Rockets]] who won titles in 1994 and 1995, during Jordan's first retirement from professional basketball.\n\nThe first championship came at the expense of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], which also saw the last appearance in the Finals for [[Magic Johnson]]. Billed{{By whom|date=December 2016}} as a showdown between the aging Johnson and the upstart Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93\u201391. For the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan a free scoring, and Chicago won the next four games. The Bulls returned to the Finals the next year, pitted against [[Clyde Drexler]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Throughout the 1991\u20131992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records in their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the two players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointers in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18\u2013[[Scottie Pippen|7]] in the final period to win the game, even with Drexler fouling out in the 4th quarter. Games 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and Portland, respectively, but the Bulls won the final two games, clinching their second championship.\n\nIn 1993, Jordan was matched against close friend [[Charles Barkley]], who was the league's reigning MVP of the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Bulls won the first two games in Phoenix, 100\u201392 and 111\u2013108. The Suns, rallying behind Barkley, won Game 3, 129\u2013121 in Chicago in triple overtime. The Bulls won Game 4, 111\u2013105, with Jordan scoring 55 points and tying [[Rick Barry]] for the second-most points in an NBA Finals game. The Suns won Game 5, 108\u201398, sending the series back to Phoenix. Chicago clinched the series in Game 6, 99\u201398, on [[John Paxson]]'s three-pointer, as the Bulls became the third team in history to [[three-peat]]. After this win, Jordan retired from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.\n\nFollowing Jordan's departure, the [[Houston Rockets]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this time, Olajuwon became the only player in history to win the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP]], [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] and Finals MVP awards in the same season. That was the only year that both the NBA and [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|NHL Finals]] went to seven games, with the Rockets facing the [[New York Knicks]] in 1994. With their win in Game 7, the Rockets denied New York from winning both the NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the [[New York Rangers]] won the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals]]. After trading for [[Clyde Drexler]] midseason, the Rockets later swept an [[Orlando Magic]] team consisting of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] in the 1995 Finals; Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP, and the Rockets became the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles and became the first 6th-seeded team to win the title without enjoying home court advantage on any of their playoff series. The Houston Rockets also beat teams with at least 50 regular season wins in every round of the playoffs, with \"Road Court\" advantage. No other team in NBA History has done that. The Houston Rockets were down 3 games to 1 to the Phoenix Suns in the Semi-Finals and won 2 out of 3 games on the road, including game 7 to advance to the Conference Finals.\n\nAfter his short stint with baseball, Jordan returned to basketball late in the 1994\u201395 season. Although he did not lead the Bulls to the Finals for that season, he returned to pre-retirement form the next season while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion [[Dennis Rodman]]. The [[1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls season|1995\u201396 Bulls]] finished the regular season 72\u201310, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history. They dominated in the playoffs, with series records of 3\u20130, 4\u20131 and 4\u20130, before facing the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the NBA Finals. After the Bulls took a 3\u20130 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after coach [[George Karl]] switched point guard [[Gary Payton]] onto Jordan, leading to a sixth game. Jordan altered his game to deal with Payton, and the Bulls won Game 6 to win their fourth title.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the [[Utah Jazz]] in the Finals twice. Led by [[Dream Team (basketball)|Dream Team]] Olympians [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]], the Jazz were defeated in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning shots in the sixth game, the first by [[Steve Kerr]] in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and winning their second three-peat. Before the lockout shortened 1998&ndash;99 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted in most of the team, including Jordan and Pippen, leaving the Bulls. With no foundation of youth to build upon, the Bulls became a [[NBA Draft Lottery|lottery-bound]] team for the next six seasons.\n\n===1999\u20132010: Lakers' & Spurs' dominance===\n[[File:Kobe Bryant 8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kobe Bryant]] was a member of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] that won five NBA championships from 2000 to 2010.]]\nThe [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]] combined to win nine NBA Championships during this period.\n\nThe Spurs were responsible for winning four championships during this time, in 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs finished with a 15\u20132 mark, including sweeps of the Blazers and Lakers. With a defensive squad led by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Tim Duncan]], San Antonio's 84.7 points allowed per game was the fewest average points allowed in the postseason in the last 30 years. In the [[1999 NBA Finals|Finals]] that year, the Spurs held the [[New York Knicks]], the first #8 seed team to reach the finals in NBA history, to an average of 79.8 points per game. During the [[2003 NBA Finals]], the Spurs defeated the New Jersey Nets in 6 games, which also marked the first championship contested between two former ABA teams. In Game 6, Duncan was two blocks short of recording the first [[quadruple-double]] in NBA Finals history, finishing with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks. The Spurs went on to defeat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 4\u20133 in the [[2005 NBA Finals]], as well as sweeping the [[LeBron James]]-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in the [[2007 NBA Finals]]. Duncan won the Finals MVP in 1999, 2003 and 2005. In 2007, [[Tony Parker]] was named MVP, becoming the first European-born player to win the award.\n\n[[File:Tim Duncan.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Tim Duncan]] won five championships with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] from 1999 to 2014.]]\nFrom 2000 to 2002, the Lakers, led by [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], won three straight NBA Championships. O'Neal won the finals MVP all three times. Their [[2000 NBA Finals|first championship]] came at the expense of the [[Indiana Pacers]], whom the Lakers defeated in 6 games. During their [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] postseason run, the Lakers swept their first 3 series and won the Finals in 5 games, finishing with an unprecedented 15\u20131 record, the best postseason record in NBA history at the time. Their opponent in the Finals that year were the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], led by [[Allen Iverson]]. In the [[2002 NBA Finals]], the Lakers swept the [[New Jersey Nets]], leading almost the entire time in each game; only for a short while after the beginning of Game 4 did the [[New Jersey Nets]] gain any significant lead in any game.\n\nIn the 2003 off-season, veteran stars [[Gary Payton]] and [[Karl Malone]] signed with the Lakers. Along with Bryant and O'Neal, they formed what many expected to be one of the best teams in NBA history, and were the favorites to win the championship in 2004. However, the [[Detroit Pistons]], under coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], defeated the Lakers in 5 games. [[Chauncey Billups]] was named the Finals MVP. Now established as one of the powerhouses of the East, the Pistons returned to the NBA Finals the following year, before losing to the Spurs in seven games.\n\nThe [[2006 NBA Finals]] were the only Finals during this time not to feature the Spurs or Lakers, instead featuring the [[Miami Heat]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]]. It was the first NBA Finals since 1971 that had both Western and Eastern Conference champions making their first Finals appearance in franchise history. The Mavericks won the first two games at home, but the turning point of the series was in Game 3, when the Heat overcame a 13-point deficit with less than 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter to win 98\u201396. The comeback was led by [[Dwyane Wade]]'s 12 points in the final six minutes and a clutch outside jumpshot by [[Gary Payton]], who was appearing in his third NBA finals. Miami won all three of their home games, two of which were sparked by fourth quarter comebacks led by Wade; the Heat won their first championship in game six. Wade was awarded the Finals MVP award.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the finals in 2008, against the [[Boston Celtics]]. Renewing the teams' rivalry, this marked the 11th time that these two teams met in the Finals, the last meeting happened in 1987. The Celtics, who defeated the Lakers 4\u20132, were led by their \"Big Three\" superstars of [[Ray Allen]], [[Kevin Garnett]], and [[Paul Pierce]], who was also named Finals MVP.\n\nThe Lakers bounced back from their 2008 loss and returned to the Finals in 2009, where they faced the [[Orlando Magic]], led by [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] [[Dwight Howard]] in 2009. The Lakers defeated Orlando in five games, with Bryant earning the Finals MVP award. The Lakers met the Celtics once again in {{nbafy|2010}}, trailing 3\u20132 before winning the last two at home, marking the first time in the history of the Celtics that they lost a Game 7 in the NBA Finals. Bryant was named Finals MVP, with the triumphs in 2009 and 2010 becoming [[Phil Jackson]]'s 10th and 11th NBA titles. With these championship victories, Jackson surpassed [[Red Auerbach]]'s record for most NBA titles of all time. He also passed Auerbach's and [[National Hockey League]] coach [[Scotty Bowman]]'s record for most titles as head coach in any major American professional sport.\n\n===2011\u20132014: Heat wave===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = LeBron James vs Washington 3-30-11.jpg\n| width1 = 129\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dwyane Wade e1.jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Chris Bosh e1.jpg\n| width3 = 111\n| footer = [[LeBron James]] (left) and [[Chris Bosh]] (right) joined [[Dwyane Wade]] (center) at the [[Miami Heat]] to form the [[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]].\n}}\n\nDuring the 2010 off-season, the [[Miami Heat]] re-signed team captain [[Dwyane Wade]] and added free agents [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] to form their [[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2248714-lebron-james-and-the-ghost-of-23|title=LeBron James and the Ghost of 23|author=Team Stream Now|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> The Heat were then considered the favorites by many to win multiple championships. They appeared in the next four finals, winning two in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]].\n\nThe Heat's second appearance in the Finals came in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]], where they were pitted against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in a rematch of the finals from [[2006 NBA Finals|five years earlier]]. The Mavericks, led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Jason Terry]], [[Tyson Chandler]], and [[Jason Kidd]], won the series 4\u20132, with Nowitzki being named the Finals MVP. The Heat returned to the finals in the [[2012 NBA Finals|following year]] against an [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] team featuring future MVPs [[Russell Westbrook]], [[James Harden]], and 3-time [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|NBA scoring leader]] [[Kevin Durant]]. After the Thunder won Game 1 at home, the Heat won four straight games to win the series 4\u20131, becoming the first team to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series. James won his first championship and was unanimously named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThe Heat repeated as champions in 2013, this time over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], with the finals being the first since 1987 to feature four former Finals MVPs in the Finals; with [[Tim Duncan]] (1999, 2003, 2005) and [[Tony Parker]] (2007) for the Spurs, and Wade (2006) and James (2012) for the Heat. The Spurs went up 3\u20132 in the series, but the Heat bounced back with a Game 6 victory, notable for a game-tying three-pointer by [[Ray Allen]] in the closing seconds of regulation to send the game into overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest playoff games in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsoutwest.com/2013/06/19/nba-finals-2013-spurs-heat-game-6-nba-history/ |title=NBA Finals 2013, Spurs vs. Heat Game 6: The greatest game ever played? |first=Michael C. |last=Jones |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623025940/http://www.sportsoutwest.com/2013/06/19/nba-finals-2013-spurs-heat-game-6-nba-history/ |archive-date=June 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Heat won Game 7, 95\u201388, to clinch the title. James was named Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n\nLooking for a [[three-peat]], the Heat reached the [[2014 NBA Finals]] and faced the Spurs in a rematch of the [[2013 NBA Finals|2013 Finals]]. With James limited in Game 1 due to leg cramps, the Spurs ended the game on a 31\u20139 run, winning 110\u201395. The Heat bounced back in Game 2, but that was their only win of the series, as the Spurs won games 3 and 4 in [[Miami]] and game 5 at home to win the championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. [[Kawhi Leonard]] was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and [[Magic Johnson]].\n\n===2015\u2013present: Warriors' dynasty===\n{{See also|Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry}}\nThe [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]] met in every NBA Finals between [[2015 NBA Finals|2015]] and [[2018 NBA Finals|2018]], becoming the first two teams to meet in four consecutive Finals. Previously, no two teams have appeared in more than two consecutive finals.\n\n[[File: Stephen Curry dribbling 2016 (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Stephen Curry]] led the [[Golden State Warriors]] to both the best regular season and postseason records in NBA history, and 3 championships.]]\nAfter the 2014 Finals, [[LeBron James]] became a free agent and returned to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] where he teamed up with [[Kyrie Irving]]. The Cavs also traded for [[Kevin Love]] to form a new \"Big Three\" in Cleveland. In the [[2015 NBA Playoffs|2015 postseason]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] were eliminated in the first round while the other 2014 finalist [[Miami Heat|Heat]] failed to qualify for the playoffs. Golden State, spearheaded by 2014\u201315 [[NBA MVP|MVP]] [[Stephen Curry]], achieved a 67\u201315 record and managed to take the West, while the Cavs won the East as James, along with [[James Jones (basketball player)|James Jones]] who played for both the Heat and Cavaliers, made their fifth straight finals appearance \u2013 the first two players to do so since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors defied conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Cavs were without star Love due to an injury suffered earlier in the playoffs, and also lost Irving to injury in a Game 1 overtime loss in the [[2015 NBA Finals]]. James rallied the Cavaliers to win Games 2 and 3, but the Warriors won the next three games after coach [[Steve Kerr]] made the adjustment of inserting the sixth man [[Andre Iguodala]] into the starting lineup in place of center [[Andrew Bogut]], thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors won the title, with Iguodala becoming the first player to win the Finals MVP award without starting a regular season game that season.\n\nDuring the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]], the Warriors broke the record for most wins in a season with a record of 73\u20139 and Curry won his second straight MVP award, as well as becoming the first unanimous MVP in history and shattering his own record for three-pointers made in a single season by over one hundred in the process. The Warriors fell to a 3\u20131 deficit in the Western Conference Finals against a [[Kevin Durant]]-led Oklahoma City Thunder team, but won three straight elimination games to take the series and advance to a second straight Finals. The Cavaliers finished the season as the top seed in the Eastern Conference and won their first 10 straight playoff games, ultimately defeating the [[Toronto Raptors]] 4\u20132 in the Eastern Conference Finals to ensure the rematch of last year's Finals. In the [[2016 NBA Finals]], the Warriors got out to a 3\u20131 lead, but James and Irving led the Cavs to two straight victories to force a deciding Game 7. In a key sequence with two minutes remaining in Game 7, LeBron James made a memorable [[The Block (basketball)|chase-down block]] on Iguodala to keep the game tied, while Irving hit a 3-point shot a minute later to take the lead. Cleveland managed to hold on to the lead to win the title and end the city's [[Cleveland sports curse|52-year championship drought]], with James earning his third Finals MVP honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2647242-cleveland-cavaliers-vs-golden-state-warriors-live-score-analysis-for-game-7|title=NBA Finals Live: Cavs vs. Warriors in Game 7|last=Johnson|first=Jared|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=June 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016 off-season, the Warriors acquired Durant through free agency.

Meanwhile, though the Cavaliers slipped to the second seed going into the playoffs, they only lost one game en route to defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, setting up another match against the Warriors in the [[2017 NBA Finals]].

Both teams fell to 3\u20132 deficits in their respective Conference Finals, before both winning Game 7s to ensure the rematch for a fourth consecutive Finals in [[2018 NBA Finals|2018]]. LeBron James appeared in his eighth consecutive NBA Finals since 2011, four each with the Heat and the Cavaliers. The Warriors went on to sweep the Cavaliers, and Durant was again named Finals MVP.\n\nIn 2018, James left the Cavaliers and signed with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Without James, the Cavaliers struggled and did not return to the playoffs. The Warriors continued their success and reached their fifth straight Finals in [[2019 NBA Finals|2019]], becoming the first team since the 1960s Celtics to make it to five straight Finals, and the first Western Conference team to ever do so.

However, manifest destiny always limped along because of its internal limitations and the issue of slavery, says Merk. It never became a national priority. By 1843, former U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated [[expansionism]] because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.<ref>{{harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA215 215\u2013216]}}</ref>\n\nMerk concluded:\n{{quote|From the outset Manifest Destiny\u2014vast in program, in its sense of [[Continentalism#Continentalism in North America|continentalism]]\u2014was slight in support.

Ill-defined but keenly felt, manifest destiny was an expression of conviction in the morality and value of expansionism that complemented other popular ideas of the era, including [[American exceptionalism]] and [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Andrew Jackson]], who spoke of \"extending the area of freedom\", typified the conflation of America's potential greatness, the nation's budding sense of Romantic self-identity, and its expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|1962|pp=[https://archive.org/details/andrewjacksonsym0000ward/page/136 136\u201337]}}</ref><ref name=\"Manifest Destiny\">{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401802517.html | title=Manifest Destiny | publisher=Encyclopedia.com taken from Dictionary of American History | year=2003 | accessdate=June 11, 2014 | last=Hidalgo |first=Dennis R.}}</ref>\n\nYet Jackson would not be the only president to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: \"A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase \"Manifest Destiny\". They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tuveson|1980|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-FM8cDl9g00C&pg=PA91 91]}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Origin of the term==\n[[File:John O'Sullivan.jpg|thumb|[[John L.

Johannsen, \"The Meaning of Manifest Destiny\", in {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997}}.</ref>\n\nO'Sullivan's second use of the phrase became extremely influential. On December 27, 1845, in his newspaper the ''New York Morning News'', O'Sullivan addressed the [[Oregon boundary dispute|ongoing boundary dispute]] with Britain. O'Sullivan argued that the United States had the right to claim \"the whole of Oregon\":\n<blockquote>And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.<ref name = McCrisken>McCrisken, Trevor B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHDkqb-myscC&pg=PA68 \"Exceptionalism: Manifest Destiny\"] in ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'' (2002), Vol. 2, p. 68</ref></blockquote>\n\nThat is, O'Sullivan believed that Providence had given the United States a mission to spread [[republican democracy]] (\"the great experiment of liberty\"). Because Britain would not spread democracy, thought O'Sullivan, British claims to the territory should be overruled. O'Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a \"higher law\") that superseded other considerations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=145}}; {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=9}}.</ref>\n\nO'Sullivan's original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of the United States would happen without the direction of the U.S.&nbsp;government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He disapproved of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=10}}</ref>\n\nIronically, O'Sullivan's term became popular only after it was criticized by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents of the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]]. Whigs denounced manifest destiny, arguing, \"that the designers and supporters of schemes of conquest, to be carried on by this government, are engaged in treason to our Constitution and Declaration of Rights, giving aid and comfort to the enemies of republicanism, in that they are advocating and preaching the doctrine of the right of conquest\".<ref>\"Prospectus of the New Series\", ''The American Whig Review'' Volume 7 Issue 1 (Jan 1848) p. 2</ref> On January 3, 1846, Representative [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert Winthrop]] ridiculed the concept in Congress, saying \"I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsFCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA134 |title=The Congressional Globe |year=1846 |publisher=United States Congress |volume=86 |pages=134 }}</ref> Winthrop was the first in a long line of critics who suggested that advocates of manifest destiny were citing \"Divine Providence\" for justification of actions that were motivated by chauvinism and self-interest. Despite this criticism, expansionists embraced the phrase, which caught on so quickly that its origin was soon forgotten.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Themes and influences ==\n[[File:Mitchell A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California 1846 UTA.jpg|thumb|''A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California'', [[Samuel Augustus Mitchell]], 1846]]\n\nHistorian William E. Weeks has noted that three key themes were usually touched upon by advocates of manifest destiny:\n* the '''virtue''' of the American people and their institutions;\n* the '''mission''' to spread these institutions, thereby redeeming and remaking the world in the image of the United States;\n* the '''destiny''' under God to do this work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|p=61}}.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the first theme, later known as [[American exceptionalism]], was often traced to America's [[Puritan]] heritage, particularly [[John Winthrop]]'s famous \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" sermon of 1630, in which he called for the establishment of a virtuous community that would be a shining example to the [[Old World]].<ref>Justin B. Litke, \"Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist\", ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197\u2013213.</ref> In his influential 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] echoed this notion, arguing that the [[American Revolution]] provided an opportunity to create a new, better society:\n<blockquote>We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand&nbsp;...</blockquote>\n\nMany Americans agreed with Paine, and came to believe that the United States' virtue was a result of its special experiment in freedom and democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to [[James Monroe]], wrote, \"it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.\"<ref name=ford2010pp315-319>{{Harvnb|Ford|2010|pp=315\u201319}}</ref> To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of \"a new time scale\" because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence. It followed that Americans owed to the world an obligation to expand and preserve these beliefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Somkin|1967|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe second theme's origination is less precise. A popular expression of America's mission was elaborated by President Abraham Lincoln's description in his December 1, 1862, message to Congress. He described the United States as \"the last, best hope of Earth\". The \"mission\" of the United States was further elaborated during Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]], in which he interpreted the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as a struggle to determine if any nation with democratic ideals could survive; this has been called by historian Robert Johannsen \"the most enduring statement of America's Manifest Destiny and mission\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref>\n\nThe third theme can be viewed as a natural outgrowth of the belief that God had a direct influence in the foundation and further actions of the United States. [[Clinton Rossiter]], a scholar, described this view as summing \"that God, at the proper stage in the march of history, called forth certain hardy souls from the old and privilege-ridden nations ... and that in bestowing his grace He also bestowed a peculiar responsibility\". Americans presupposed that they were not only divinely elected to maintain the North American continent, but also to \"spread abroad the fundamental principles stated in the Bill of Rights\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossiter|1950|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> In many cases this meant neighboring colonial holdings and countries were seen as obstacles rather than the destiny God had provided the United States.\n\n[[John Mack Faragher|Faragher's]] analysis of the political polarization between the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] is that:\n{{quote|Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue, the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'', (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref>}}\n\nAnother possible influence is racial predominance, namely the idea that the American Anglo-Saxon race was \"separate, innately superior\" and \"destined to bring good government, commercial prosperity and Christianity to the American continents and the world\". This view also held that \"inferior races were doomed to subordinate status or extinction.\" This was used to justify \"the enslavement of the blacks and the expulsion and possible extermination of the Indians\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Race and Manifest Destiny |author=Reginald Horsman |pages=2, 6}}</ref>\n\n== Alternative interpretations ==\nWith the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, [[Thomas Jefferson]] set the stage for the continental expansion of the United States. Many began to see this as the beginning of a new [[providentialism|providential]] mission: If the United States was successful as a \"[[City upon a Hill|shining city upon a hill]]\", people in other countries would seek to establish their own democratic republics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry |title=A City Upon a Hill: How Sermons Changed the Course of American History |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all Americans or their political leaders believed that the United States was a divinely favored nation, or thought that it ought to expand. For example, many [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] opposed territorial expansion based on the Democratic claim that the United States was destined to serve as a virtuous example to the rest of the world, and also had a divine obligation to spread its superordinate political system and a way of life throughout North American continent. Many in the Whig party \"were fearful of spreading out too widely\", and they \"adhered to the concentration of national authority in a limited area\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA40 40]}}</ref> In July 1848, [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] denounced [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] expansionist interpretation of America's future as \"mendacious\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Byrnes |first=Mark Eaton |title=James K. Polk: A Biographical Companion |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |page=145}}</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S. Grant]], served in the War with Mexico and later wrote:\n: I was bitterly opposed to the measure [to annex Texas], and to this day regard the war [with Mexico] which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.<ref>See [http://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/america7_brief/content/multimedia/ch14/research_01d.htm \"U.S. Grant, Memoir on the Mexican War (1885)\"]</ref>\n\nIn the mid\u201119th century, expansionism, especially southward toward Cuba, also faced opposition from those Americans who were trying to abolish slavery. As more territory was added to the United States in the following decades, \"extending the area of freedom\" in the minds of southerners also meant extending the institution of slavery. That is why slavery became one of the central issues in the continental expansion of the United States before the Civil War.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Michael A. |title=Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1997}}</ref>\n\nBefore and during the Civil War both sides claimed that America's destiny were rightfully their own.

However, the American victories at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 ended the Indian raids and removed the main reason for threatening annexation. To end the [[War of 1812]] [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[Albert Gallatin]] (former Treasury Secretary and a leading expert on Indians) and the other American diplomats negotiated the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814 with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S.&nbsp;territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:\n{{quote|The United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain&nbsp;...

An early proponent of this idea, [[John Quincy Adams]] became a leading figure in U.S. expansion between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]] in the 1840s. In 1811, Adams wrote to [[John Adams|his father]]:\n\n<blockquote>The whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one ''nation'', speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable that they should be associated in one federal Union.<ref>Adams quoted in {{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=78}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie - Walters 37194049.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[Fort Laramie]] as it looked prior to 1840. Painting from memory by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]].]]\nAdams did much to further this idea. He orchestrated the [[Treaty of 1818]], which established the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]] as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for the joint occupation of the region known in American history as the [[Oregon Country]] and in British and Canadian history as the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] and [[Columbia District]]s. He negotiated the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Transcontinental Treaty]] in 1819, transferring [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] from Spain to the United States and extending the U.S. border with Spanish Mexico all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And he formulated the [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, which warned Europe that the [[Western Hemisphere]] was no longer open for European colonization.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine and \"manifest destiny\" formed a closely related nexus of principles: historian Walter McDougall calls manifest destiny a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine, because while the Monroe Doctrine did not specify expansion, expansion was necessary in order to enforce the Doctrine. Concerns in the United States that European powers (especially Great Britain) were seeking to acquire colonies or greater influence in North America led to calls for expansion in order to prevent this. In his influential 1935 study of manifest destiny, Albert Weinberg wrote: \"the expansionism of the [1830s] arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of Europe in North America\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=74}}; {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=109}}.</ref>\n\n==== All Oregon ====\nManifest destiny played its most important role in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] between the United States and Britain, when the phrase \"manifest destiny\" originated. The [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] had provided for the joint occupation of the [[Oregon Country]], and thousands of Americans migrated there in the 1840s over the [[Oregon Trail]]. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President [[John Tyler]] (in office 1841\u20131845) to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th&nbsp;parallel]], and instead proposed a boundary line farther south along the [[Columbia River]], which would have made most of what later became the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] part of British North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the Alaska line ([[54-40|54\u00b040\u02b9 N]]). Presidential candidate [[James K. Polk]] used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of \"All Oregon\" in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1844|1844 U.S.&nbsp;Presidential election]].\n\n[[File:Emanuel Leutze - Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way - Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way]]'' (1861). The title of the painting, from a 1726 poem by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], was a phrase often quoted in the era of manifest destiny, expressing a widely held belief that civilization had steadily moved westward throughout history.

This was an idealized process of expansion that had been advocated from Jefferson to O'Sullivan: newly democratic and independent states would request entry into the United States, rather than the United States extending its government over people who did not want it. The annexation of Texas was attacked by anti-slavery spokesmen because it would add another slave state to the Union. Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren declined Texas's offer to join the United States in part because the slavery issue threatened to divide the Democratic Party.<ref>Lyon Rathbun, Lyon \"The debate over annexing Texas and the emergence of manifest destiny.\" ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 4#3 (2001): 459\u201393.</ref>\n\nBefore the election of 1844, Whig candidate [[Henry Clay]] and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark R.

This paved the way for the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] on April 24, 1846. With American successes on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \"All Mexico\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA144 144\u201347]}}; {{Harvnb|Fuller|1936}}; {{Harvnb|Hietala|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThis was a controversial proposition for two reasons. First, idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like John L. O'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \"All Mexico\" would be a violation of this principle. And secondly, the annexation of Mexico was controversial because it would mean extending U.S.&nbsp;citizenship to millions of Mexicans. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of South Carolina, who had approved of the annexation of Texas, was opposed to the annexation of Mexico, as well as the \"mission\" aspect of manifest destiny, for racial reasons.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \"All Mexico\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|pp=87\u201395}}.</ref> Conversely, proponents of annexation of \"All Mexico\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fuller|1936|pp=119, 122, 162 and ''passim''}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Growth from 1840 to 1850]]\nThe controversy was eventually ended by the [[Mexican Cession]], which added the territories of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated.\n\nHistorian [[Frederick Merk]], in ''Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation'' (1963), argued that the failure of the \"All Oregon\" and \"All Mexico\" movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \"continentalism\" were aberrations supported by only a minority of Americans, all of them Democrats.

A case study by David Beyreis depicts these effects through the operations of a fur trading and Indian trading business named Bent, St. Vrain and Company during the period.

Some, such as [[John Quitman]], governor of Mississippi, offered what public support they could offer. In one memorable case, Quitman simply explained that the state of Mississippi had \"lost\" its state arsenal, which began showing up in the hands of filibusters. Yet these isolated cases only solidified opposition in the North as many Northerners were increasingly opposed to what they believed to be efforts by Southern slave owners\u2014and their friends in the North\u2014to expand slavery through [[filibuster (military)|filibustering]]. [[Sarah Parker Remond|Sarah P. Remond]] on January 24, 1859, delivered an impassioned speech at [[Warrington, England]], that the connection between filibustering and slave power was clear proof of \"the mass of corruption that underlay the whole system of American government\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1985}}</ref> The [[Wilmot Proviso]] and the continued \"[[Slave Power]]\" narratives thereafter, indicated the degree to which manifest destiny had become part of the sectional controversy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael A.

Originally filibuster had come from the Dutch ''vrijbuiter'' and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the ''[[The New York Times|New-York Daily Times]]'' \"the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country.

The Democratic Party's national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker's filibustering in [[Nicaragua]]. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of manifest destiny's filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crenshaw|1941}}</ref> William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California.<ref>James Mitchell Clarke,  \"Antonio Melendrez: Nemesis of William Walker in Baja California.\" ''California Historical Society Quarterly'' 12.4 (1933): 318\u2013322.

As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute a threat to the interests of the United States. Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100&nbsp;million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso L\u00f3pez to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{Harvnb|Crocker|2006|p=150}}.</ref>\n\nFilibustering continued to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of [[Franklin Pierce]], a filibustering effort by [[John A. Quitman]] to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130&nbsp;million. When the public learned of the [[Ostend Manifesto]] in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|pp=144\u201352}}.</ref>\n\nFilibusters like [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] continued to garner headlines in the late 1850s, but to little effect. Expansionism was among the various [[origins of the American Civil War|issues that played a role]] in the coming of the war. With the divisive question of the expansion of slavery, Northerners and Southerners, in effect, were coming to define manifest destiny in different ways, undermining nationalism as a unifying force. According to Frederick Merk, \"The doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which in the 1840s had seemed Heaven-sent, proved to have been a bomb wrapped up in idealism.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA214 214]}}.</ref>\n\nThe filibusterism of the era even opened itself up to some mockery among the headlines. In 1854, a San Francisco Newspaper published a satirical poem called \"Filibustering Ethics\". This poem features two characters, Captain Robb and Farmer Cobb. Captain Robb makes claim to Farmer Cobb's land arguing that Robb deserves the land because he is Anglo-Saxon, has weapons to \"Blow out\" Cobb's brains, and nobody has heard of Cobb so what right does Cobb have to claim the land. Cobb argues that Robb doesn't need his land because Robb already has more land than he knows what to do with. However, due to threats of violence, Cobb surrenders his land and leaves grumbling that \"''might'' should be the rule of ''right'' among ''enlightened'' nations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burge|first=Daniel|date=August 2016|title=Manifest Mirth: The Humorous Critique of Manifest Destiny, 1846-1858|url=|journal=Western Historical Quarterly|volume=47 no. 3|pages=283-302|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Homestead Act ===\n{{Main|Homestead Acts}}\n[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|[[Norwegian American|Norwegian]] settlers in North Dakota in front of their homestead, a [[Sod house|sod hut]]]]\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged 600,000 families to settle the West by giving them land (usually 160 [[acre]]s) almost free.

In a policy formulated largely by [[Henry Knox]], [[Secretary of War]] in the Washington Administration, the U.S.&nbsp;government sought to expand into the west through the purchase of Native American land in treaties. Only the Federal Government could purchase Indian lands and this was done through treaties with tribal leaders. Whether a tribe actually had a decision-making structure capable of making a treaty was a controversial issue. The national policy was for the Indians to join American society and become \"civilized\", which meant no more wars with neighboring tribes or raids on white settlers or travelers, and a shift from hunting to farming and ranching. Advocates of civilization programs believed that the process of settling native tribes would greatly reduce the amount of land needed by the Native Americans, making more land available for homesteading by white Americans. [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed that while American Indians were the intellectual equals of whites,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prucha|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&pg=PA137 137]}}, \"I believe the Indian then to be in body and mind equal to the white man,\" (Jefferson letter to the Marquis de Chastellux, June 7, 1785).</ref> they had to live like the whites or inevitably be pushed aside by them.<ref name=\"American Indians\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/american-indians |title=American Indians |publisher=Thomas Jefferson's Monticello |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref> Jefferson's belief, rooted in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, that whites and Native Americans would merge to create a single nation did not last his lifetime, and he began to believe that the natives should emigrate across the [[Mississippi River]] and maintain a separate society, an idea made possible by the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.<ref name=\"American Indians\" />\n\nIn the age of manifest destiny, this idea, which came to be known as \"[[Indian removal]]\", gained ground. Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study ''Race and Manifest Destiny'', racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would \"fade away\" as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America's first great historians, [[Francis Parkman]], whose landmark book ''[[Pontiac's Rebellion|The Conspiracy of Pontiac]]'' was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the British conquest of Canada in 1760, Indians were \"destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed\". Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Parkman|title=The conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian war after the conquest of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA4tAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR9|origyear=1851|year=1913|page=9}}</ref>\n\n== Beyond North America ==\n[[File:Annexation Here to Stay.jpg|thumb|Newspaper reporting the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898]]\nAs the Civil War faded into history, the term ''manifest destiny'' experienced a brief revival.

During that time, manifest destiny was cited to promote [[history of United States overseas expansion|overseas expansion]].

These islands, however, were acquired as [[colonialism|colonies]] rather than prospective states. The process was validated by the [[Insular Cases]]. The Supreme Court ruled that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Torruella |first1=Juan |title=Ruling America's Colonies: The 'Insular Cases' |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1652&context=ylpr |format=PDF |journal=[[Yale Law & Policy Review]] |date=Fall 2013 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=65\u201368 |jstor=23736226}}</ref> Nevertheless, in 1917, all Puerto Ricans were made full American citizens via the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act|Jones Act]].

Previously, \"Manifest Destiny had contained a principle so fundamental that a Calhoun and an O'Sullivan could agree on it\u2014that a people not capable of rising to statehood should never be annexed. That was the principle thrown overboard by the imperialism of 1899.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA257 257]}}.</ref> [[Albert Beveridge|Albert J. Beveridge]] maintained the contrary at his September 25, 1900, speech in the Auditorium, at Chicago. He declared that the current desire for Cuba and the other acquired territories was identical to the views expressed by Washington, Jefferson and Marshall. Moreover, \"the sovereignty of the Stars and Stripes can be nothing but a blessing to any people and to any land.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Beveridge|1908|p=123}}</ref> The Philippines was eventually given its independence in 1946; Guam and Puerto Rico have special status to this day, but all their people have United States citizenship.\n\nThe English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\" to Americans, calling on them to take up their share of the burden.

The nascent [[First Philippine Republic|revolutionary government]] desirous of independence, however, resisted the United States in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] in 1899; it won no support from any government anywhere and collapsed when its leader was captured.

Under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] the role of the United States in the New World was defined, in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], as being an \"international police power\" to secure American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt's corollary contained an explicit rejection of territorial expansion. In the past, manifest destiny had been seen as necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere, but now expansionism had been replaced by [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] as a means of upholding the doctrine.\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]] continued the policy of interventionism in the Americas, and attempted to redefine both manifest destiny and America's \"mission\" on a broader, worldwide scale. Wilson led the United States into [[World War&nbsp;I]] with the argument that \"The world must be made safe for democracy.\" In his 1920 message to Congress after the war, Wilson stated:\n<blockquote>... I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.</blockquote>\n\nThis was the only time a president had used the phrase \"manifest destiny\" in his annual address. Wilson's version of manifest destiny was a rejection of expansionism and an endorsement (in principle) of [[self-determination]], emphasizing that the United States had a mission to be a world leader for the cause of democracy. This U.S. vision of itself as the leader of the \"[[Free World]]\" would grow stronger in the 20th century after [[World War&nbsp;II]], although rarely would it be described as \"manifest destiny\", as Wilson had done.<ref>[[s:President Wilson's War Address|\"Safe for democracy\"]]; [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29561 1920 message]; Wilson's version of manifest destiny: {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=471}}.</ref>\n\n\"Manifest destiny\" is sometimes used by critics of U.S.&nbsp;foreign policy to characterize interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere. In this usage, \"manifest destiny\" is interpreted as the underlying cause of what is denounced by some as \"[[American imperialism]]\". A more positive-sounding phrase devised by scholars at the end of the twentieth century is \"nation building\", and State Department official Karin Von Hippel notes that the U.S. has \"been involved in nation-building and promoting democracy since the middle of the nineteenth century and 'Manifest Destiny{{'\"}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Karin Von Hippel |title=Democracy by Force: U.S. Military Intervention in the Post-Cold War World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Eminent domain in the United States]]\n* [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]\u2014Missouri senator, proponent of western expansion\n* [[Stephen A.

However, manifest destiny always limped along because of its internal limitations and the issue of slavery, says Merk. It never became a national priority. By 1843, former U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated [[expansionism]] because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.<ref>{{harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA215 215\u2013216]}}</ref>\n\nMerk concluded:\n{{quote|From the outset Manifest Destiny\u2014vast in program, in its sense of [[Continentalism#Continentalism in North America|continentalism]]\u2014was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its magnitude. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit.

Ill-defined but keenly felt, manifest destiny was an expression of conviction in the morality and value of expansionism that complemented other popular ideas of the era, including [[American exceptionalism]] and [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Andrew Jackson]], who spoke of \"extending the area of freedom\", typified the conflation of America's potential greatness, the nation's budding sense of Romantic self-identity, and its expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|1962|pp=[https://archive.org/details/andrewjacksonsym0000ward/page/136 136\u201337]}}</ref><ref name=\"Manifest Destiny\">{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401802517.html | title=Manifest Destiny | publisher=Encyclopedia.com taken from Dictionary of American History | year=2003 | accessdate=June 11, 2014 | last=Hidalgo |first=Dennis R.}}</ref>\n\nYet Jackson would not be the only president to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: \"A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase \"Manifest Destiny\". They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tuveson|1980|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-FM8cDl9g00C&pg=PA91 91]}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Origin of the term==\n[[File:John O'Sullivan.jpg|thumb|[[John L.

O'Sullivan's first usage of the phrase \"manifest destiny\" attracted little attention.<ref>Robert W. Johannsen, \"The Meaning of Manifest Destiny\", in {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997}}.</ref>\n\nO'Sullivan's second use of the phrase became extremely influential. On December 27, 1845, in his newspaper the ''New York Morning News'', O'Sullivan addressed the [[Oregon boundary dispute|ongoing boundary dispute]] with Britain. O'Sullivan argued that the United States had the right to claim \"the whole of Oregon\":\n<blockquote>And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.<ref name = McCrisken>McCrisken, Trevor B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHDkqb-myscC&pg=PA68 \"Exceptionalism: Manifest Destiny\"] in ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'' (2002), Vol. 2, p. 68</ref></blockquote>\n\nThat is, O'Sullivan believed that Providence had given the United States a mission to spread [[republican democracy]] (\"the great experiment of liberty\"). Because Britain would not spread democracy, thought O'Sullivan, British claims to the territory should be overruled. O'Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a \"higher law\") that superseded other considerations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=145}}; {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=9}}.</ref>\n\nO'Sullivan's original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of the United States would happen without the direction of the U.S.&nbsp;government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He disapproved of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=10}}</ref>\n\nIronically, O'Sullivan's term became popular only after it was criticized by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents of the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]]. Whigs denounced manifest destiny, arguing, \"that the designers and supporters of schemes of conquest, to be carried on by this government, are engaged in treason to our Constitution and Declaration of Rights, giving aid and comfort to the enemies of republicanism, in that they are advocating and preaching the doctrine of the right of conquest\".<ref>\"Prospectus of the New Series\", ''The American Whig Review'' Volume 7 Issue 1 (Jan 1848) p. 2</ref> On January 3, 1846, Representative [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert Winthrop]] ridiculed the concept in Congress, saying \"I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsFCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA134 |title=The Congressional Globe |year=1846 |publisher=United States Congress |volume=86 |pages=134 }}</ref> Winthrop was the first in a long line of critics who suggested that advocates of manifest destiny were citing \"Divine Providence\" for justification of actions that were motivated by chauvinism and self-interest. Despite this criticism, expansionists embraced the phrase, which caught on so quickly that its origin was soon forgotten.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Themes and influences ==\n[[File:Mitchell A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California 1846 UTA.jpg|thumb|''A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California'', [[Samuel Augustus Mitchell]], 1846]]\n\nHistorian William E. Weeks has noted that three key themes were usually touched upon by advocates of manifest destiny:\n* the '''virtue''' of the American people and their institutions;\n* the '''mission''' to spread these institutions, thereby redeeming and remaking the world in the image of the United States;\n* the '''destiny''' under God to do this work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|p=61}}.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the first theme, later known as [[American exceptionalism]], was often traced to America's [[Puritan]] heritage, particularly [[John Winthrop]]'s famous \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" sermon of 1630, in which he called for the establishment of a virtuous community that would be a shining example to the [[Old World]].<ref>Justin B. Litke, \"Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist\", ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197\u2013213.</ref> In his influential 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] echoed this notion, arguing that the [[American Revolution]] provided an opportunity to create a new, better society:\n<blockquote>We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand&nbsp;...</blockquote>\n\nMany Americans agreed with Paine, and came to believe that the United States' virtue was a result of its special experiment in freedom and democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to [[James Monroe]], wrote, \"it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.\"<ref name=ford2010pp315-319>{{Harvnb|Ford|2010|pp=315\u201319}}</ref> To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of \"a new time scale\" because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence. It followed that Americans owed to the world an obligation to expand and preserve these beliefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Somkin|1967|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe second theme's origination is less precise. A popular expression of America's mission was elaborated by President Abraham Lincoln's description in his December 1, 1862, message to Congress. He described the United States as \"the last, best hope of Earth\". The \"mission\" of the United States was further elaborated during Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]], in which he interpreted the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as a struggle to determine if any nation with democratic ideals could survive; this has been called by historian Robert Johannsen \"the most enduring statement of America's Manifest Destiny and mission\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref>\n\nThe third theme can be viewed as a natural outgrowth of the belief that God had a direct influence in the foundation and further actions of the United States. [[Clinton Rossiter]], a scholar, described this view as summing \"that God, at the proper stage in the march of history, called forth certain hardy souls from the old and privilege-ridden nations ... and that in bestowing his grace He also bestowed a peculiar responsibility\". Americans presupposed that they were not only divinely elected to maintain the North American continent, but also to \"spread abroad the fundamental principles stated in the Bill of Rights\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossiter|1950|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> In many cases this meant neighboring colonial holdings and countries were seen as obstacles rather than the destiny God had provided the United States.\n\n[[John Mack Faragher|Faragher's]] analysis of the political polarization between the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] is that:\n{{quote|Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue, the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'', (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref>}}\n\nAnother possible influence is racial predominance, namely the idea that the American Anglo-Saxon race was \"separate, innately superior\" and \"destined to bring good government, commercial prosperity and Christianity to the American continents and the world\". This view also held that \"inferior races were doomed to subordinate status or extinction.\" This was used to justify \"the enslavement of the blacks and the expulsion and possible extermination of the Indians\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Race and Manifest Destiny |author=Reginald Horsman |pages=2, 6}}</ref>\n\n== Alternative interpretations ==\nWith the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, [[Thomas Jefferson]] set the stage for the continental expansion of the United States. Many began to see this as the beginning of a new [[providentialism|providential]] mission: If the United States was successful as a \"[[City upon a Hill|shining city upon a hill]]\", people in other countries would seek to establish their own democratic republics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry |title=A City Upon a Hill: How Sermons Changed the Course of American History |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all Americans or their political leaders believed that the United States was a divinely favored nation, or thought that it ought to expand. For example, many [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] opposed territorial expansion based on the Democratic claim that the United States was destined to serve as a virtuous example to the rest of the world, and also had a divine obligation to spread its superordinate political system and a way of life throughout North American continent. Many in the Whig party \"were fearful of spreading out too widely\", and they \"adhered to the concentration of national authority in a limited area\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA40 40]}}</ref> In July 1848, [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] denounced [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] expansionist interpretation of America's future as \"mendacious\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Byrnes |first=Mark Eaton |title=James K. Polk: A Biographical Companion |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |page=145}}</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S. Grant]], served in the War with Mexico and later wrote:\n: I was bitterly opposed to the measure [to annex Texas], and to this day regard the war [with Mexico] which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.<ref>See [http://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/america7_brief/content/multimedia/ch14/research_01d.htm \"U.S. Grant, Memoir on the Mexican War (1885)\"]</ref>\n\nIn the mid\u201119th century, expansionism, especially southward toward Cuba, also faced opposition from those Americans who were trying to abolish slavery. As more territory was added to the United States in the following decades, \"extending the area of freedom\" in the minds of southerners also meant extending the institution of slavery. That is why slavery became one of the central issues in the continental expansion of the United States before the Civil War.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Michael A. |title=Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1997}}</ref>\n\nBefore and during the Civil War both sides claimed that America's destiny were rightfully their own. Lincoln opposed anti-immigrant [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], and the imperialism of manifest destiny as both unjust and unreasonable.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mountjoy |first=Shane |title=Manifest Destiny: Westward Expansion |location=New York |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |year=2009}}</ref> He objected to the Mexican War and believed each of these disordered forms of patriotism threatened the inseparable moral and fraternal bonds of liberty and Union that he sought to perpetuate through a patriotic love of country guided by wisdom and critical self-awareness.

To end the [[War of 1812]] [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[Albert Gallatin]] (former Treasury Secretary and a leading expert on Indians) and the other American diplomats negotiated the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814 with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S.&nbsp;territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:\n{{quote|The United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation.

An early proponent of this idea, [[John Quincy Adams]] became a leading figure in U.S. expansion between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]] in the 1840s. In 1811, Adams wrote to [[John Adams|his father]]:\n\n<blockquote>The whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one ''nation'', speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable that they should be associated in one federal Union.<ref>Adams quoted in {{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=78}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie - Walters 37194049.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[Fort Laramie]] as it looked prior to 1840. Painting from memory by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]].]]\nAdams did much to further this idea. He orchestrated the [[Treaty of 1818]], which established the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]] as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for the joint occupation of the region known in American history as the [[Oregon Country]] and in British and Canadian history as the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] and [[Columbia District]]s. He negotiated the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Transcontinental Treaty]] in 1819, transferring [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] from Spain to the United States and extending the U.S. border with Spanish Mexico all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And he formulated the [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, which warned Europe that the [[Western Hemisphere]] was no longer open for European colonization.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine and \"manifest destiny\" formed a closely related nexus of principles: historian Walter McDougall calls manifest destiny a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine, because while the Monroe Doctrine did not specify expansion, expansion was necessary in order to enforce the Doctrine. Concerns in the United States that European powers (especially Great Britain) were seeking to acquire colonies or greater influence in North America led to calls for expansion in order to prevent this. In his influential 1935 study of manifest destiny, Albert Weinberg wrote: \"the expansionism of the [1830s] arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of Europe in North America\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=74}}; {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=109}}.</ref>\n\n==== All Oregon ====\nManifest destiny played its most important role in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] between the United States and Britain, when the phrase \"manifest destiny\" originated. The [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] had provided for the joint occupation of the [[Oregon Country]], and thousands of Americans migrated there in the 1840s over the [[Oregon Trail]]. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President [[John Tyler]] (in office 1841\u20131845) to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th&nbsp;parallel]], and instead proposed a boundary line farther south along the [[Columbia River]], which would have made most of what later became the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] part of British North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the Alaska line ([[54-40|54\u00b040\u02b9 N]]). Presidential candidate [[James K. Polk]] used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of \"All Oregon\" in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1844|1844 U.S.&nbsp;Presidential election]].\n\n[[File:Emanuel Leutze - Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way - Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way]]'' (1861). The title of the painting, from a 1726 poem by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], was a phrase often quoted in the era of manifest destiny, expressing a widely held belief that civilization had steadily moved westward throughout history. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060105071332/http://americanart.si.edu/t2go/1lw/1931.6.1.html (more)] ]]\n\nAs president, however, Polk sought compromise and renewed the earlier offer to divide the territory in half along the 49th&nbsp;parallel, to the dismay of the most ardent advocates of manifest destiny. When the British refused the offer, American expansionists responded with slogans such as \"The Whole of Oregon or None!\" and \"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!\", referring to the northern border of the region. (The latter slogan is often mistakenly described as having been a part of the 1844 presidential campaign.)<ref>{{cite journal |title='Fifty-four Forty or Fight'\u2014An American Political Legend |first=Edwin A. |last=Miles |journal=The Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=44 |issue=2 |publisher=Organization of American Historians |date=September 1957 |page=291\u2013309 |jstor=1887191 |doi=10.2307/1887191}}</ref> When Polk moved to terminate the joint occupation agreement, the British finally agreed in early 1846 to divide the region along the 49th parallel, leaving the lower Columbia basin as part of the United States. The [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 formally settled the dispute; Polk's administration succeeded in selling the treaty to Congress because the United States was about to begin the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the president and others argued it would be foolish [[Two-front war|to also fight the British Empire]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nDespite the earlier clamor for \"All Oregon\", the Oregon Treaty was popular in the United States and was easily ratified by the Senate. The most fervent advocates of manifest destiny had not prevailed along the northern border because, according to [[Reginald C. Stuart|Reginald Stuart]], \"the compass of manifest destiny pointed west and southwest, not north, despite the use of the term 'continentalism{{'\"}}.<ref>Treaty popular: {{Harvnb|Stuart|1988|p=104}}; compass quote p. 84.</ref>\n\nIn 1869, American historian [[Frances Fuller Victor]] published ''[[wikisource:en:The Overland Monthly/Volume 3/Manifest Destiny in the West|Manifest Destiny in the West]]'' in the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'', arguing that the efforts of early American fur traders and missionaries presaged American control of Oregon. She concluded the article as follows:\n{{cquote|It was an oversight on the part of the United States, the giving up the island of Quadra and Vancouver, on the settlement of the boundary question.

(Harcourt, 1963).</ref>  In 1836, the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico and, after the [[Texas Revolution]], sought to join the United States as a new state. This was an idealized process of expansion that had been advocated from Jefferson to O'Sullivan: newly democratic and independent states would request entry into the United States, rather than the United States extending its government over people who did not want it. The annexation of Texas was attacked by anti-slavery spokesmen because it would add another slave state to the Union. Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren declined Texas's offer to join the United States in part because the slavery issue threatened to divide the Democratic Party.<ref>Lyon Rathbun, Lyon \"The debate over annexing Texas and the emergence of manifest destiny.\" ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 4#3 (2001): 459\u201393.</ref>\n\nBefore the election of 1844, Whig candidate [[Henry Clay]] and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark R.

Polk moved to occupy a portion of Texas that had [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence from Mexico]] in 1836, but was still claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] on April 24, 1846. With American successes on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \"All Mexico\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA144 144\u201347]}}; {{Harvnb|Fuller|1936}}; {{Harvnb|Hietala|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThis was a controversial proposition for two reasons. First, idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like John L. O'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \"All Mexico\" would be a violation of this principle. And secondly, the annexation of Mexico was controversial because it would mean extending U.S.&nbsp;citizenship to millions of Mexicans. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of South Carolina, who had approved of the annexation of Texas, was opposed to the annexation of Mexico, as well as the \"mission\" aspect of manifest destiny, for racial reasons.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \"All Mexico\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny.<ref>{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|pp=87\u201395}}.</ref> Conversely, proponents of annexation of \"All Mexico\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fuller|1936|pp=119, 122, 162 and ''passim''}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Growth from 1840 to 1850]]\nThe controversy was eventually ended by the [[Mexican Cession]], which added the territories of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated.\n\nHistorian [[Frederick Merk]], in ''Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation'' (1963), argued that the failure of the \"All Oregon\" and \"All Mexico\" movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \"continentalism\" were aberrations supported by only a minority of Americans, all of them Democrats. Some Democrats were also opposed; the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Billy H.

A case study by David Beyreis depicts these effects through the operations of a fur trading and Indian trading business named Bent, St. Vrain and Company during the period. The telling of this company shows that the idea of Manifest Destiny wasn't unanimously loved by all Americans and didn't always benefit Americans. The case study goes on to show that this company could have ceased to exist in the name of territorial expansion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beyreis|first=David|date=June 1, 2018|title=The Chaos of Conquest: The Bents and the Problem of American Expansion, 1846\u20131849|url=|journal=Kansas History|volume=41 no. 2|pages=74-98|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Filibusterism ===\nAfter the Mexican\u2013American War ended in 1848, disagreements over the expansion of slavery made further annexation by conquest too divisive to be official government policy. Some, such as [[John Quitman]], governor of Mississippi, offered what public support they could offer. In one memorable case, Quitman simply explained that the state of Mississippi had \"lost\" its state arsenal, which began showing up in the hands of filibusters. Yet these isolated cases only solidified opposition in the North as many Northerners were increasingly opposed to what they believed to be efforts by Southern slave owners\u2014and their friends in the North\u2014to expand slavery through [[filibuster (military)|filibustering]]. [[Sarah Parker Remond|Sarah P. Remond]] on January 24, 1859, delivered an impassioned speech at [[Warrington, England]], that the connection between filibustering and slave power was clear proof of \"the mass of corruption that underlay the whole system of American government\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1985}}</ref> The [[Wilmot Proviso]] and the continued \"[[Slave Power]]\" narratives thereafter, indicated the degree to which manifest destiny had become part of the sectional controversy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael A.

Originally filibuster had come from the Dutch ''vrijbuiter'' and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the ''[[The New York Times|New-York Daily Times]]'' \"the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country. Her pulse beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there's a very high color on her face.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E7D8133DE034BC4C53DFB566838F649FDE |title=A Critical Day|date=March 4, 1854|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Millard Fillmore's second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict.

The Democratic Party's national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker's filibustering in [[Nicaragua]]. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of manifest destiny's filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crenshaw|1941}}</ref> William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California.<ref>James Mitchell Clarke,  \"Antonio Melendrez: Nemesis of William Walker in Baja California.\" ''California Historical Society Quarterly'' 12.4 (1933): 318\u2013322.

As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute a threat to the interests of the United States. Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100&nbsp;million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso L\u00f3pez to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{Harvnb|Crocker|2006|p=150}}.</ref>\n\nFilibustering continued to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of [[Franklin Pierce]], a filibustering effort by [[John A. Quitman]] to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130&nbsp;million. When the public learned of the [[Ostend Manifesto]] in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|pp=144\u201352}}.</ref>\n\nFilibusters like [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] continued to garner headlines in the late 1850s, but to little effect. Expansionism was among the various [[origins of the American Civil War|issues that played a role]] in the coming of the war. With the divisive question of the expansion of slavery, Northerners and Southerners, in effect, were coming to define manifest destiny in different ways, undermining nationalism as a unifying force. According to Frederick Merk, \"The doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which in the 1840s had seemed Heaven-sent, proved to have been a bomb wrapped up in idealism.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA214 214]}}.</ref>\n\nThe filibusterism of the era even opened itself up to some mockery among the headlines.

Captain Robb makes claim to Farmer Cobb's land arguing that Robb deserves the land because he is Anglo-Saxon, has weapons to \"Blow out\" Cobb's brains, and nobody has heard of Cobb so what right does Cobb have to claim the land. Cobb argues that Robb doesn't need his land because Robb already has more land than he knows what to do with. However, due to threats of violence, Cobb surrenders his land and leaves grumbling that \"''might'' should be the rule of ''right'' among ''enlightened'' nations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burge|first=Daniel|date=August 2016|title=Manifest Mirth: The Humorous Critique of Manifest Destiny, 1846-1858|url=|journal=Western Historical Quarterly|volume=47 no. 3|pages=283-302|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Homestead Act ===\n{{Main|Homestead Acts}}\n[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|[[Norwegian American|Norwegian]] settlers in North Dakota in front of their homestead, a [[Sod house|sod hut]]]]\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged 600,000 families to settle the West by giving them land (usually 160 [[acre]]s) almost free.

In a policy formulated largely by [[Henry Knox]], [[Secretary of War]] in the Washington Administration, the U.S.&nbsp;government sought to expand into the west through the purchase of Native American land in treaties. Only the Federal Government could purchase Indian lands and this was done through treaties with tribal leaders. Whether a tribe actually had a decision-making structure capable of making a treaty was a controversial issue. The national policy was for the Indians to join American society and become \"civilized\", which meant no more wars with neighboring tribes or raids on white settlers or travelers, and a shift from hunting to farming and ranching. Advocates of civilization programs believed that the process of settling native tribes would greatly reduce the amount of land needed by the Native Americans, making more land available for homesteading by white Americans. [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed that while American Indians were the intellectual equals of whites,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prucha|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&pg=PA137 137]}}, \"I believe the Indian then to be in body and mind equal to the white man,\" (Jefferson letter to the Marquis de Chastellux, June 7, 1785).</ref> they had to live like the whites or inevitably be pushed aside by them.<ref name=\"American Indians\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/american-indians |title=American Indians |publisher=Thomas Jefferson's Monticello |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref> Jefferson's belief, rooted in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, that whites and Native Americans would merge to create a single nation did not last his lifetime, and he began to believe that the natives should emigrate across the [[Mississippi River]] and maintain a separate society, an idea made possible by the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.<ref name=\"American Indians\" />\n\nIn the age of manifest destiny, this idea, which came to be known as \"[[Indian removal]]\", gained ground. Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study ''Race and Manifest Destiny'', racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would \"fade away\" as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America's first great historians, [[Francis Parkman]], whose landmark book ''[[Pontiac's Rebellion|The Conspiracy of Pontiac]]'' was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the British conquest of Canada in 1760, Indians were \"destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed\". Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Parkman|title=The conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian war after the conquest of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA4tAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR9|origyear=1851|year=1913|page=9}}</ref>\n\n== Beyond North America ==\n[[File:Annexation Here to Stay.jpg|thumb|Newspaper reporting the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898]]\nAs the Civil War faded into history, the term ''manifest destiny'' experienced a brief revival. Protestant missionary [[Josiah Strong]], in his best seller of 1885 [[Our Country (book)|''Our Country'']], argued that the future was devolved upon America since it had perfected the ideals of civil liberty, \"a pure spiritual Christianity\", and concluded, \"My plea is not, Save America for America's sake, but, Save America for the world's sake.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Strong|1885|pp=107\u201308}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[U.S. presidential election, 1892|1892 U.S.&nbsp;presidential election]], the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] platform proclaimed: \"We reaffirm our approval of the [[Monroe doctrine]] and believe in the achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Official Manual of the State of Missouri|year=1895|publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Missouri|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AtWgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&dq=%22achievement+of+the+manifest+destiny+of+the+Republic%22#v=onepage&q=%22achievement%20of%20the%20manifest%20destiny%20of%20the%20Republic%22&f=false}}</ref> What was meant by \"manifest destiny\" in this context was not clearly defined, particularly since the Republicans lost the election.\n\nIn the [[U.S. presidential election, 1896|1896 election]], however, the Republicans recaptured the White House and held on to it for the next 16&nbsp;years. During that time, manifest destiny was cited to promote [[history of United States overseas expansion|overseas expansion]]. Whether or not this version of manifest destiny was consistent with the continental expansionism of the 1840s was debated at the time, and long afterwards.<ref>Republican Party [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=R1892 platform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018004944/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=R1892 |date=October 18, 2007 }}; context not clearly defined, {{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA241 241]}}.</ref>\n\nFor example, when President [[William McKinley]] advocated annexation of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898, he said that \"We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny.\" On the other hand, former President [[Grover Cleveland]], a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley's annexation of the territory was a \"perversion of our national destiny\". Historians continued that debate; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely [[imperialism]].<ref>McKinley quoted in {{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|pp=112\u201313}}; {{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA257 257]}}.</ref>\n\n=== Spanish\u2013American War and the Philippines ===\n[[File:Well, I hardly know which to take first! 5-28-1898.JPG|thumb|A cartoon of [[Uncle Sam]] seated in restaurant looking at the bill of fare containing \"Cuba steak\", \"Porto Rico pig\", the \"Philippine Islands\" and the \"Sandwich Islands\" (Hawaii)]]\nIn 1898, the United States intervened in the Cuban insurrection and launched the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] to force Spain out.

Under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] the role of the United States in the New World was defined, in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], as being an \"international police power\" to secure American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt's corollary contained an explicit rejection of territorial expansion. In the past, manifest destiny had been seen as necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere, but now expansionism had been replaced by [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] as a means of upholding the doctrine.\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]] continued the policy of interventionism in the Americas, and attempted to redefine both manifest destiny and America's \"mission\" on a broader, worldwide scale. Wilson led the United States into [[World War&nbsp;I]] with the argument that \"The world must be made safe for democracy.\" In his 1920 message to Congress after the war, Wilson stated:\n<blockquote>... I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.</blockquote>\n\nThis was the only time a president had used the phrase \"manifest destiny\" in his annual address. Wilson's version of manifest destiny was a rejection of expansionism and an endorsement (in principle) of [[self-determination]], emphasizing that the United States had a mission to be a world leader for the cause of democracy. This U.S. vision of itself as the leader of the \"[[Free World]]\" would grow stronger in the 20th century after [[World War&nbsp;II]], although rarely would it be described as \"manifest destiny\", as Wilson had done.<ref>[[s:President Wilson's War Address|\"Safe for democracy\"]]; [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29561 1920 message]; Wilson's version of manifest destiny: {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=471}}.</ref>\n\n\"Manifest destiny\" is sometimes used by critics of U.S.&nbsp;foreign policy to characterize interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere. In this usage, \"manifest destiny\" is interpreted as the underlying cause of what is denounced by some as \"[[American imperialism]]\".

Her parents were conservative and conventional, her father the managing director of [[Dunlop Australia]], her mother a housewife, so to enter the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA) at the age of 16 in the very first intake in 1959 was a brave step, in which she was fully supported by her parents.<ref name=\"smh\" />\n\n=== Professional life ===\nAt the outset of her career, she had a variety of roles in radio and television, working mainly at the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], including current affairs, music, chat shows and children's shows throughout the early 1960s.
