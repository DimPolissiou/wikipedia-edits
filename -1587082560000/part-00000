The NES restarted the [[video game industry]] after the [[video game crash of 1983]], and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) was a strong seller, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was a very strong contender. Nintendo and [[Sega]] would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[Nintendo 64]], though Nintendo managed to sell more than [[Sega Saturn]].\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]], released in 1999, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[Nintendo DS|DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling consoles]] of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D]] capabilities, with the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]], released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, [[Nintendo Switch]], was released in March 2017 and has now surpassed the entire lifetime sales of the Wii U.\n== Home consoles ==\n\n=== Color TV-Game ===\n{{Main|Color TV-Game}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Color-TV-Game-Blockbreaker-FL.jpg|thumb|One of five [[Color TV-Game]] consoles|215px]]The [[Color TV-Game]] is a series of five dedicated home consoles released only in Japan.

In Japan, it is known as the \"Family Computer\" (or \"Famicom\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]''<!-- NOT the Mario series, which was started in arcades in Donkey Kong, and not Kirby, which was started on the GameBoy --> were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/16/news102.html|script-title=ja:\u521d\u4ee3\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u300d\u306a\u3069\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u7406\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=|date=October 16, 2007|work=ITmedia News|publisher=ITmedia|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |title=Nintendo of Japan dropping Hardware support for the Famicom |accessdate=January 20, 2008 |author=RyanDG |date=October 16, 2007 |publisher=Arcade Renaissance |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317164110/http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nintendo's classic Famicom faces end of road |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |format=Reprint |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105193128/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |archivedate=November 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016.

In [[Japan]] it is known as the '''Super Famicom'''. In [[South Korea]], it is known as the '''Super Comboy''' and was distributed by [[Hyundai Electronics]].\n\nThe Super NES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the Super NES was a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]\u2014due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console (released in Europe and Asia but Korea as the Mega Drive). Despite its relatively late start, the Super NES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]], selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/> The Super NES library is known for upgrading some of Nintendo's most famous franchises, and making the games even more critically acclaimed, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI|VI]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'', as well starting some popular franchises such as ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]''.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64}}\n[[File:N64-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|A [[Nintendo 64]]|215px]]\nReleased June 23, 1996, The '''Nintendo 64''', commonly called the '''N64''', and codenamed Ultra 64, was Nintendo's third home [[video game console]] for the international market.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

As of December 31, 2013, Nintendo DSi consoles have sold 41.33 million units.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo 3DS ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 3DS}}\n[[File:Nintendo-3DS-AquaOpen.png|thumb|right|An original [[Nintendo 3DS]]|215px]]\nAlthough the name and look of the device are similar to that of the DS series, the '''Nintendo 3DS''' (or shortly '''3DS''') is the successor to the DS and a brand new console. The Nintendo 3DS was released February 26, 2011.\nIt contains three cameras, two on the outside (for 3D photographs) and one internal one above the top screen. The bottom screen is a touch screen comparable to the DS bottom screens, and the top screen is Wide Screen and an autostereoscopic 3D LCD. ''[[Autostereoscopy]]'' is a process that sends different images to the left and right eyes to enable the viewer to view the screen in 3D \"without the need for special glasses\". The 3DS is said to enhance Nintendo's online experience. In 2012, the 3DS XL was released, similar to the change between the DSi and DSi XL. It has 90% larger screens and design changes such as a matte finish and the stylus in a more accessible area.\nThe [[Nintendo 2DS|2DS]] was released on October 12, 2013. It is a variant designed to be affordable without the clamshell design or 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Another redesign, the [[New Nintendo 3DS]], was released in Japan in October 2014, Australia for November 2014, and everywhere else in February 2015. It includes a C-Stick, ZR and ZL shoulder buttons, and a faster CPU, allowing for more software specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (such as ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 3D]]''). Like the original 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS also has an XL form.\nAs of December 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold 42.74 million units, including 15.21 million Nintendo 3DS XLs and 2.11 million Nintendo 2DS units.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nThe latest handheld console was the [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]], which was released in July 2017 across five different countries and is the only model still in production.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo Switch ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Switch}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-wJoyCons-BlRd-Standing-FL.jpg|thumb|left|The Nintendo Switch]]\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid home and portable console.

Leo tries to kill Rachel, but she shoots him with his own gun, revealing before she does so that she purposely drowned Danny, who she hated.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Rachel is shown walking away from the camp as Leo gets up, and puts his mask on after it is pushed across the floor by an invisible force.

Noah accepts his death as inevitable, telling Claire that Samuel has trapped them there so she can watch him die (Claire cannot suffocate as her lungs will continue to regenerate). Claire, however, is unable to accept her father's death, even as he tells her his dying wish is for her to hide herself as a normal human after Samuel exposes his powers to the world. As Noah begins to run out of breath, [[Tracy Strauss]] arrives through a water channel in the dirt surrounding the trailer and is able to bring both Claire and Noah back to the surface alive, where they meet up with [[List of Heroes characters#Lauren Gilmore|Lauren Gilmore]]. Lauren has called a helicopter to take the three of them to Central Park, where Samuel and his carnival are setting up for \"the greatest show on earth,\" while Tracy has disappeared for unknown reasons.\n\nMeanwhile, at [[Matt Parkman]]'s house, [[Sylar]] and [[Peter Petrelli|Peter]], now freed from the nightmare in Sylar's mind, stop [[List of Heroes characters#Eli|Eli]] from killing Matt by knocking the original Eli out. Peter reads Eli's mind and learns of Samuel's devastating plans. Matt refuses to let Sylar go with Peter, even after Sylar asks him to look inside his mind and decide for himself whether or not Sylar's intentions are noble. Although Matt still does not fully trust Sylar's mind, he grudgingly gives him a chance to prove himself on Peter's plea to trust them. As the two leave, Matt approaches the unconscious Eli and instructs him to return to the carnival.\n\nIn Central Park, as the carnival sets up, [[List of Heroes characters#Emma Coolidge|Emma Coolidge]] confronts Samuel, who confirms Peter's dream is true. As Emma refuses to comply, [[List of Heroes characters#Eric Doyle|Doyle]] emerges from Samuel's trailer and puppets her into playing, which quickly attracts a large crowd as well as media attention. Peter and Sylar arrive and split up; Peter looks for Samuel as Sylar goes to save Emma. Upon finding her, he too is controlled by Doyle until Emma, noticing a momentary gap in attention, blasts Doyle with her synesthetic sound manipulation ability. Sylar telekinetically pins Doyle to the ground as he begs for mercy, telling Sylar that he is not a good guy. Sylar responds defiantly that, \"I'm a hero.\" He is later shown to have tied up Doyle with a string of lights rather than simply kill him, another sign to prove his change into a new person.\n\nAt the hospital, [[Hiro Nakamura]] awakens from his hallucination and tells [[Ando Masahashi|Ando]] that he is fully healed. As they prepare to leave, a nurse gives Hiro a note from a woman in another hospital room. The note reads, \"Is it really you?\" and is accompanied by a small origami swan. Hiro rushes to the room to find [[List of Heroes characters#Charlie Andrews|Charlie Andrews]] on the bed, now an 85-year-old woman. Hiro is shocked as she explains that at the Burnt Toast Diner, [[List of Heroes characters#Arnold|Arnold]] took her back to Milwaukee on January 26, 1944, where she lived her life, getting a job in a war factory. Hiro, after talking with Ando, explains that he can \"fix this\" by time-traveling to 1944 and bringing her back so they can live a life together. Charlie admits the idea is tempting, but explains that she has lived a life, marrying and having four kids and seven grandchildren, one of whom Hiro meets, named Sally. Hiro realizes he cannot take this life away from Charlie for his own personal happiness just as Ando receives an urgent call for help from Noah. Hiro transports himself and Ando to the carnival after saying a final goodbye to Charlie.\n\nMeanwhile, Noah and Claire have also shown up and split ways; Claire to convince the carnival specials to leave, and Noah to find Samuel. However, Noah is quickly captured at knifepoint by [[List of Heroes characters#Edgar|Edgar]], who pulls him aside and reveals that he also wants to stop Samuel. Claire finds Samuel's people and attempts to convince them of Samuel's evil intentions, telling them of Samuel's ability to grow stronger with more superhumans around him. No one listens to her until she reveals that Samuel killed his brother [[List of Heroes characters#Joseph Sullivan|Joseph]]. The crowd finally believes her when Noah arrives with Edgar, who backs up Claire's claim, explaining that Lydia told him everything before she was killed. Eli also arrives, having been brainwashed by Matt Parkman, and tells everyone how Samuel had him kill Lydia. As everyone leaves Samuel, he attempts to get them back, but eventually screams, \"Run as fast as you can! You'll never get far enough!\" Afterward, he goes out to address the large crowd, and begins to use his powers to shake the earth. However, Peter flies into him, taking his ability, and they enter into a battle in Samuel's tent in which they're both equally matched. Hiro and Ando arrive and Hiro, after being supercharged by Ando, transports all the carnival superhumans away from Central Park, rendering Samuel powerless and allowing Peter to defeat him in hand-to-hand combat. Peter throws Samuel on stage and he collapses on the ground, hopeless and alone. Noah remarks to Peter, \"I gotta say, I never liked carnivals\" which Peter agrees with.\n\n===Volume Six: ''Brave New World''===\nAs Samuel is taken away by the reformed Company, Lauren speaks with the press, feeding them a cover story to hide the truth of what went on there that night. As the press turn to question Claire and Noah, Claire gets them to follow her as she climbs to the top of the [[Ferris wheel]]. Sylar notes to Peter that while he wanted to kill Doyle, he choose not to and saving Emma felt good. As they notice Claire climbing, Peter states that she will change everything and Sylar declares, \"It's a brave new world.\" Claire leaps off of the Ferris wheel with the press watching. With the cameras in her face, she relocates her arm and the cut on her face heals. She says, \"My name is Claire Bennet, and this is attempt number...I guess I've kinda lost count.\"\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Brave New World\" received mixed to positive reviews.

Noah accepts his death as inevitable, telling Claire that Samuel has trapped them there so she can watch him die (Claire cannot suffocate as her lungs will continue to regenerate). Claire, however, is unable to accept her father's death, even as he tells her his dying wish is for her to hide herself as a normal human after Samuel exposes his powers to the world. As Noah begins to run out of breath, [[Tracy Strauss]] arrives through a water channel in the dirt surrounding the trailer and is able to bring both Claire and Noah back to the surface alive, where they meet up with [[List of Heroes characters#Lauren Gilmore|Lauren Gilmore]]. Lauren has called a helicopter to take the three of them to Central Park, where Samuel and his carnival are setting up for \"the greatest show on earth,\" while Tracy has disappeared for unknown reasons.\n\nMeanwhile, at [[Matt Parkman]]'s house, [[Sylar]] and [[Peter Petrelli|Peter]], now freed from the nightmare in Sylar's mind, stop [[List of Heroes characters#Eli|Eli]] from killing Matt by knocking the original Eli out. Peter reads Eli's mind and learns of Samuel's devastating plans. Matt refuses to let Sylar go with Peter, even after Sylar asks him to look inside his mind and decide for himself whether or not Sylar's intentions are noble. Although Matt still does not fully trust Sylar's mind, he grudgingly gives him a chance to prove himself on Peter's plea to trust them. As the two leave, Matt approaches the unconscious Eli and instructs him to return to the carnival.\n\nIn Central Park, as the carnival sets up, [[List of Heroes characters#Emma Coolidge|Emma Coolidge]] confronts Samuel, who confirms Peter's dream is true. As Emma refuses to comply, [[List of Heroes characters#Eric Doyle|Doyle]] emerges from Samuel's trailer and puppets her into playing, which quickly attracts a large crowd as well as media attention. Peter and Sylar arrive and split up; Peter looks for Samuel as Sylar goes to save Emma. Upon finding her, he too is controlled by Doyle until Emma, noticing a momentary gap in attention, blasts Doyle with her synesthetic sound manipulation ability. Sylar telekinetically pins Doyle to the ground as he begs for mercy, telling Sylar that he is not a good guy. Sylar responds defiantly that, \"I'm a hero.\" He is later shown to have tied up Doyle with a string of lights rather than simply kill him, another sign to prove his change into a new person.\n\nAt the hospital, [[Hiro Nakamura]] awakens from his hallucination and tells [[Ando Masahashi|Ando]] that he is fully healed.
