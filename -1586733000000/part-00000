After achieving a 6\u20132 record at the halfway mark, the Lions lost seven of their last eight games. They finished with a 7\u20139 record for their seventh consecutive losing season. The Lions improved upon their 3\u201313 record in [[2006 Detroit Lions season|2006]] but failed to make the playoffs once again, extending their postseason drought to eight years.

After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit got off to a fast start in the second quarter.  QB [[Jon Kitna]] completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]] and kicker [[Jason Hanson]] connected on a 46-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Lions increased its lead with Kitna completing a 16-yard TD pass to rookie WR [[Calvin Johnson (American football)|Calvin Johnson]].  The Raiders, however, started to catch up with QB [[Josh McCown]] completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Ronald Curry]] along with RB [[LaMont Jordan]] getting a 12-yard TD run.  In a wild fourth quarter, Hanson gave Detroit a 46-yard field goal, yet the Raiders took the lead with McCown's 7-yard TD pass to FB [[Justin Griffith]].  The Lions hung on to take the lead with Kitna's 32-yard TD pass to WR/PR [[Shaun McDonald]], Hanson kicking a 23-yard field goal, and wrapping it up with RB [[Tatum Bell]] getting a 14-yard TD run.\n\nWith the win, Detroit began its season at 1\u20130.\n\n=== Week 2: vs. Minnesota Vikings===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Vikings\n|R1=0\n|R2=7\n|R3=10\n|R4=0\n|R5=0\n|RT=36\n|Home='''Lions'''\n|H1=0\n|H2=10\n|H3=7\n|H4=0\n|H5=3\n|HT=21\n}}\n''at [[Ford Field]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]''\n\nFollowing their road win over the Raiders, the Lions played their Week 2 home opener against their NFC North rival [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] for the lead in the division.  After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit pounced first with QB [[Jon Kitna]] completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]].  The Vikings tied the game with QB [[Tarvaris Jackson]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Lions took the lead prior to halftime with kicker [[Jason Hanson]]'s 30-yard field goal.\n\nIn the third quarter, when Kitna was temporarily out with a concussion, QB [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] came in and completed a 7-yard TD pass to [[Calvin Johnson (American football)|Calvin Johnson]] to increase Detroit's lead.  Minnesota, however, tied the game up with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] getting a 32-yard field goal and DE [[Ray Edwards (American football)|Ray Edwards]] returning a fumble 9 yards for a touchdown.  After both teams failed to score in the fourth quarter, the Vikings got the ball to begin overtime.  The Lions forced a fumble nine plays into their drive and eventually got the win with Hanson's 37-yard field goal.\n\nWith the win, Detroit improved its record to 2\u20130.\n\n=== Week 3: at Philadelphia Eagles===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Lions\n|R1=7\n|R2=14\n|R3=0\n|R4=0\n|RT=21\n|Home='''Eagles'''\n|H1=21\n|H2=21\n|H3=7\n|H4=7\n|HT=56\n}}\n''at [[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]''\n\nFollowing their impressive divisional home win over the Vikings, the Lions flew to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] for an intraconference fight with the throwback-clad [[2007 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].\n\nIn the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as Eagles RB [[Brian Westbrook]] ran 25 yards for a TD.  The Lions tied the game on a [[Kevin Jones (American football)|Kevin Jones]] 2-yard TD run, but Philadelphia regained the lead with a Westbrook 5 yard TD run, along with QB [[Donovan McNabb]]'s 68-yard TD pass to WR [[Kevin Curtis]].

After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit got off to a fast start in the second quarter.  QB [[Jon Kitna]] completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]] and kicker [[Jason Hanson]] connected on a 46-yard field goal.

After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit pounced first with QB [[Jon Kitna]] completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]].  The Vikings tied the game with QB [[Tarvaris Jackson]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Lions took the lead prior to halftime with kicker [[Jason Hanson]]'s 30-yard field goal.\n\nIn the third quarter, when Kitna was temporarily out with a concussion, QB [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] came in and completed a 7-yard TD pass to [[Calvin Johnson (American football)|Calvin Johnson]] to increase Detroit's lead.  Minnesota, however, tied the game up with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] getting a 32-yard field goal and DE [[Ray Edwards (American football)|Ray Edwards]] returning a fumble 9 yards for a touchdown.  After both teams failed to score in the fourth quarter, the Vikings got the ball to begin overtime.

The Lions tied the game on a [[Kevin Jones (American football)|Kevin Jones]] 2-yard TD run, but Philadelphia regained the lead with a Westbrook 5 yard TD run, along with QB [[Donovan McNabb]]'s 68-yard TD pass to WR [[Kevin Curtis]].  In the second quarter, the points bonanza continued as McNabb and Curtis hooked up with each other again on a 12-yard TD pass and a 43-yard TD pass to increase the Eagles' lead.  Detroit responded with QB [[Jon Kitna]] completing TD passes of 11 yards to WR [[Shaun McDonald]] and 91 yards to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]].  Philadelphia capped the half with McNabb completing a 43-yard TD pass to Westbrook.\n\nIn the second half, the Eagles took control as RB [[Correll Buckhalter]] ran 1 yard for a TD run in the third quarter and RB [[Tony Hunt]] ran for a 1-yard TD in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith the loss, the Lions fell to 2\u20131.\n\n=== Week 4: vs. Chicago Bears===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Bears\n|R1=0\n|R2=7\n|R3=6\n|R4=14\n|RT=27\n|Home='''Lions'''\n|H1=3\n|H2=0\n|H3=0\n|H4=34\n|HT=37\n}}\n''at [[Ford Field]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]''\n\nTrying to rebound from their road loss to the Eagles, the Lions went home for an NFC North duel with the defending NFC champion [[2007 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]. In the first quarter, Detroit drew first blood with kicker [[Jason Hanson]] nailing a 49-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  However, in the second quarter, the Bears took the lead with QB [[Brian Griese]] ([[Rex Grossman]] was benched prior to the game) completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR [[Muhsin Muhammad]] for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, Chicago increased its lead with kicker [[Robbie Gould]] getting a 49-yard and a 41-yard field goal.\n\nAfterwards, a high-flying fourth quarter began with QB [[Jon Kitna]] completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Shaun McDonald]], along with DB [[Keith Smith (cornerback)|Keith Smith]] returning an interception 64 yards for a touchdown, giving the Lions the lead.

Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR [[Troy Edwards]], along with RB Kevin Jones getting a 5-yard TD pass.

Heading into the game, Detroit had never won a game against the Redskins in Washington, D.C. (0\u201320)\n\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, the Lions trailed as in the second quarter when Redskins QB [[Jason Campbell]] completed a 7-yard TD pass to TE [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]], followed by FB [[Mike Sellers]] getting a 1-yard TD run.

As a result of their winless 2008 and 2\u201314 2009 seasons, this became the Lions\u2019 last win on the road until Week 15 of the 2010 season.

This defeat marked the beginning of a stretch through week 13 of 2010 in which they went 5\u201347, which at the time was the worst 52-game stretch in NFL history.

From there, a tramway took the rails, sleepers and bricks up to the railway track at Muri.\n\nMuri opened on 28 July 1952, 45 chains (905 m) north of [[Pukerua Bay railway station|Pukerua Bay]], and was closer to the centre of the population of Pukerua Bay at the time.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct railway stations in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Wellington]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Porirua]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1952]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 2011]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muri_railway_station"}

John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Bovillan alias Bovealan''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Bovillan alias Bovealan''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.
