The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\n==Origins and history==\nEarly mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:<ref>{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin? | access-date=2016-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204224225/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | archive-date=2016-02-04 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.<br>\n'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | ''Love's Labour's Lost'', William Shakespeare}}\n\nAn 1866 article describes a \"hog latin\" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin.

'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,\" although the jargon is dog Latin.\n\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: \"They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126140403/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |archive-date=2016-11-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] and that song included in the all-time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\nA 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today.

Examples are:\n*\"eat\" = \"eatway\" or \"eatay\"\n*\"omelet\" = \"omeletway\" or \"omeletay\"\n*\"are\" = \"areway\" or \"areay\"\n*\"egg\" = \"eggway\" or \"eggay\"\n*\"explain\" = \"explainway\"\n*\"always\" = \"alwaysway\" or \"alwaysay\"\n*\"ends\" = \"endsway\" or \"endsay\"\n*\"honest\" = \"honestway\"\n*\"I\"= \"Iway\"\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:\n*\"every\" = \"eryevay\"\n*\"another\" = \"otheranay\"\n*\"under\" = \"erunday\"\n*\"island\" = \"andislay\"\n*\"elegant\" = \"egantelay\"\n\nSentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.<!--emma  = emmway\nPlease do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra).

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too.

[[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.<!--emma  = emmway\nPlease do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra).

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

(The Stooges use of ''ixnay'' and ''amscray'' in particular probably led to their widespread use in [[American English]].)\n* In ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' (1933), Ginger Rogers sings a verse of \"We're in the Money\" in pig Latin.\n* In the film ''[[Short Circuit 2]],'' it is used in a couple of scenes, first between bad guys in front of Johnny 5 to prevent him from getting the tactical instruction.\n* In the children's book [[Holes (novel)|''Holes'']] by Louis Sachar, one character goes by the nickname X-ray (exray) because it is the pig Latin version of his given name, Rex.\n* In the film ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' (1993), The Abbot performs a ceremony of wedding \"in the new Latin\", while actually speaking a language resembling Pig Latin, i.e. adding \"ay\" to every word.\n* In ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' [[List of Teen Titans Go! episodes|Season 3 Episode 32]], four of the Titans use Pig Latin in an attempt to stop Robin's eavesdropping.\n* In ''[[Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse]]'' episode 2: \"The Tomb of Sammun-Mak\", the summoning spell of Yog Soggoth, the eldritch god, is \"Umkay Onninnay, the Otterway's Inefay!\" which means \"Come on in, the water's fine!\"\n* In ''[[The Lion King]]'', Zazu uses the phrase \"Ixnay on the upidstay.\" (Nix on the stupid)\n* In ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Sully tells Mike to \"Ooklay in the agbay\" (Look in the bag) to try to communicate to Mike the seriousness of their situation without alerting Mike's date.\n* In the second episode of'' [[Stranger Things 3]] '' \"Chapter Two: The Mall Rats\", the character of Robin claims to know four languages in order to help [[Dustin Henderson (Stranger Things)|Dustin Henderson]] and [[Steve Harrington (Stranger Things)|Steve Harrington]] translate a Russian message. When questioned by Dustin if one of these languages is Russian, Robin responds with \"Ou-yay are-yay umb-day\", only to mockingly inform the boys that this was Pig Latin.\n* Texas singer, songwriter, novelist, humorist, and politician, [[Kinky Friedman]] recorded a version of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s 1973 song \"Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother\" sung entirely in pig Latin.\n* In the film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', the character Raoul Duke tries to conceal an illicit cargo from a suspicious child by suggesting that he and his friend \"ogay and etgay the uffstay out of the unktray.\"\n* In the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]],'' the character Dolores mutters \"Ixnay, ixnay\" as she presses the alarm button at the bar where Roger and Eddie Valiant are hiding.\n*In the film, ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'', while Stanley Ipkiss sneaks out of the precinct with Lieutenant Kellaway at gunpoint as the lieutenant's 'prisoner,' Kellaway says to Detective Doyle \"Ixnay. Ehay's otgay an ungay.\" (Nix. He's got a gun), and the oblivious Doyle replies \"Oh, I get it. Pig latin, right? Eesay ouyay aterlay.\" (See you later.)\n* In the song [[Wasted Little DJs]] by the Scottish band [[The View (band)|The View]], they utilise Pig Latin in the chorus - \"Aystedway Ittlay Eejaysday\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Barlow, Jessica. 2001. \"Individual differences in the production of initial consonant sequences in Pig Latin.\" ''[[Lingua (journal)|Lingua]]'' 111:667-696.\n* Cowan, Nelson. 1989. \"Acquisition of Pig Latin: A Case Study.\" ''Journal of Child Language'' 16.2:365-386.\n* Day, R. 1973. \"On learning 'secret languages.'\" ''Haskins Laboratories Status Report on Speech Research'' 34:141-150.\n* Haycock, Arthur. \"Pig Latin.\" ''American Speech'' 8:3.81.\n* McCarthy, John. 1991. \"Reduplicative Infixation in Secret Languages\" [''L'Infixation reduplicative dans les langages secrets''].

His paintings, sound recordings, and installations focus heavily on how certain principles in society converge and interact. His goal is to reveal how the individual interacts with the collective body and how the architecture we find ourselves in defines our subconscious and our interactions with each other. The foundation of his work is painting but in recent years he has expanded his practice to encompass a variety of mediums and think tank initiatives. His interest lies in the distorted connections of political, economic, cultural and social principles<ref>{{Citation|title=Sobey Art Award 2019 - Nicolas Grenier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLyzwzMrIA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and how moneyless economies, radical inclusivity, giving up individualism, and other ideas could evoke a paradigm shift in values and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nicolasgrenier.com/|title=Nicolas Grenier|website=nicolasgrenier.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in [[Montreal|Montreal Canada]] in 1982. He holds a BFA from [[Concordia University]] (2004) and a MFA from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (2010).

She developed an early interest in flying, but African Americans, Native Americans, and women had no [[flight training]] opportunities in the United States, so she saved up money and obtained sponsorships to go to [[France]] for flight school.

At the age of 12, Bessie was accepted into the Missionary Baptist Church School on scholarship.

But, to succeed in this highly competitive arena, she would need advanced lessons and a more extensive repertoire. Returning to Chicago, Coleman could not find anyone willing to teach her, so in February 1922, she sailed again for Europe. She spent the next two months in France completing an advanced course in aviation, then left for the [[Netherlands]] to meet with [[Anthony Fokker]], one of the world's most distinguished aircraft designers. She also traveled to Germany, where she visited the [[Fokker]] Corporation and received additional training from one of the company's chief pilots. She then returned to the United States to launch her career in exhibition flying.<ref name=rich/>\n\n\"Queen Bess,\" as she was known, was a highly popular draw for the next five years. Invited to important events and often interviewed by newspapers, she was admired by both blacks and whites. She primarily flew [[Curtiss JN-4]] \"Jenny\" [[biplanes]] and other aircraft which had been army surplus aircraft left over from the war. She made her first appearance in an American [[airshow]] on September 3, 1922, at an event honoring veterans of the all-black [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|369th Infantry Regiment]] of [[World War I]].

Coleman never lost sight of her childhood vow to one day \"amount to something.\" As a professional aviatrix, Coleman would often be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. However, she also quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. In Los Angeles, she broke a leg and three ribs when her plane stalled and crashed on February 22, 1923.\n[[File:Bessie Coleman and her plane (1922).jpg|thumb|Bessie Coleman, c.1922.]]\n\nCommitted to promoting aviation and combating racism, Coleman spoke to audiences across the country about the pursuit of aviation and goals for African Americans.  She absolutely refused to participate in aviation events that prohibited the attendance of African Americans.{{sfn|Creasman|1997|p=162}}\n\nIn the 1920s, in Orlando, Florida, on a speaking tour, she met the Rev. Hezakiah Hill and his wife Viola, community activists who invited her to stay with them at the parsonage of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church on Washington Street in the neighbourhood of [[Parramore]].  A local street was renamed  \"Bessie Coleman\" Street in her honour in 2013.

She gladly accepted, hoping the publicity would help to advance her career and provide her with some of the money she needed to establish her own flying school. But upon learning that the first scene in the movie required her to appear in tattered clothes, with a walking stick and a pack on her back, she refused to proceed. \"Clearly ...

She had recently purchased a Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) in [[Dallas]]. Her mechanic and publicity agent, 24-year-old William D. Wills, flew the plane from Dallas in preparation for an airshow but had to make three [[emergency landing|forced landings]] along the way because the plane had been so poorly maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/bessie-coleman |title=Bessie Coleman Facts |work=yourdictionary.com}}</ref> Upon learning this, Coleman's friends and family did not consider the aircraft safe and implored her not to fly it. On take-off, Wills was flying the plane with Coleman in the other seat. She had not put on her seat belt because she was planning a parachute jump for the next day and wanted to look over the cockpit sill to examine the Brendans.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the flight, the plane unexpectedly went into a [[Dive (aviation)|dive]] and then a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] at 3,000 feet above the ground. Coleman was thrown from the plane at {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and died instantly when she hit the ground. William Wills was unable to regain control of the plane and it plummeted to the ground. Wills died upon impact and the plane exploded and burst into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.<ref name=\"rich\" />\n\nFuneral services were held in Florida before her body was sent back to Chicago.

But, to succeed in this highly competitive arena, she would need advanced lessons and a more extensive repertoire. Returning to Chicago, Coleman could not find anyone willing to teach her, so in February 1922, she sailed again for Europe. She spent the next two months in France completing an advanced course in aviation, then left for the [[Netherlands]] to meet with [[Anthony Fokker]], one of the world's most distinguished aircraft designers.

Invited to important events and often interviewed by newspapers, she was admired by both blacks and whites. She primarily flew [[Curtiss JN-4]] \"Jenny\" [[biplanes]] and other aircraft which had been army surplus aircraft left over from the war. She made her first appearance in an American [[airshow]] on September 3, 1922, at an event honoring veterans of the all-black [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|369th Infantry Regiment]] of [[World War I]].

Coleman never lost sight of her childhood vow to one day \"amount to something.\" As a professional aviatrix, Coleman would often be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. However, she also quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. In Los Angeles, she broke a leg and three ribs when her plane stalled and crashed on February 22, 1923.\n[[File:Bessie Coleman and her plane (1922).jpg|thumb|Bessie Coleman, c.1922.]]\n\nCommitted to promoting aviation and combating racism, Coleman spoke to audiences across the country about the pursuit of aviation and goals for African Americans.

But upon learning that the first scene in the movie required her to appear in tattered clothes, with a walking stick and a pack on her back, she refused to proceed. \"Clearly ...

Wills, flew the plane from Dallas in preparation for an airshow but had to make three [[emergency landing|forced landings]] along the way because the plane had been so poorly maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/bessie-coleman |title=Bessie Coleman Facts |work=yourdictionary.com}}</ref> Upon learning this, Coleman's friends and family did not consider the aircraft safe and implored her not to fly it. On take-off, Wills was flying the plane with Coleman in the other seat. She had not put on her seat belt because she was planning a parachute jump for the next day and wanted to look over the cockpit sill to examine the Brendans.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the flight, the plane unexpectedly went into a [[Dive (aviation)|dive]] and then a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] at 3,000 feet above the ground. Coleman was thrown from the plane at {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and died instantly when she hit the ground. William Wills was unable to regain control of the plane and it plummeted to the ground. Wills died upon impact and the plane exploded and burst into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.<ref name=\"rich\" />\n\nFuneral services were held in Florida before her body was sent back to Chicago.  While there was little mention in most media, news of her death was widely carried in the African American press and 10,000 mourners attended her ceremonies in Chicago, which were led by activist [[Ida B.

[[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\n\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' include: [[Minnesota]] in 1911, [[Capital punishment in Vermont|Vermont]] in 1964, [[Iowa]] and [[Capital punishment in West Virginia|West Virginia]] in 1965 and [[North Dakota]] in 1973. [[Hawaii]] abolished the death penalty in 1948 and [[Alaska]] in 1957, both before their statehood. [[Capital punishment in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] repealed it in 1929 and the [[Capital punishment in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by [[Suffrage|popular vote]] in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later;  Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984.<ref name=\"Ballotpedia\">{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Death_penalty_on_the_ballot|title= Death penalty on the ballot |publisher= ballotpedia.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\n\n===Constitutional law developments===\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\", according to abolitionist [[Hugo Adam Bedau|Hugo Bedau]].<ref>The Courts, the Constitution, and Capital Punishment 118 (1977)</ref>\n\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment's [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] clause must draw its meaning from the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', the court made the first step of what would later be called \"death is different\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases \u2013 a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.\n\n===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===\n{{Further|Furman v. Georgia}}In ''Furman v. Georgia'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \"unitary trial\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-''Furman'' execution was that of [[Luis Monge (mass murderer)|Luis Monge]] on June 2, 1967.\n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be ''per se'' unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of [[Byron White]] and [[Potter Stewart]], expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and [[William O. Douglas]] worried explicitly about [[Race and capital punishment in the United States|racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty]]. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe ''Furman'' decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \"legal bombshell\".<ref name=\"Latzer\"/> The next day, columnist [[Barry Schweid]] wrote that it was \"unlikely\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pAoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3786,38609|title=The Free Lance-Star \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\n===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===\n{{Further|Gregg v. Georgia}}\n[[File:Panorama of United States Supreme Court Building at Dusk.jpg|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court seat in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in ''Furman''. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his ''Furman'' opinion. Other states adopted \"bifurcated\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\n\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''<ref>''Gregg v. Georgia'', {{ussc|428|153|1976}}</ref> and upheld 7\u20132 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any [[mitigating factor]]s exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]''<ref>''Woodson v. North Carolina'', {{ussc|428|280|1976}}</ref> and ''[[Roberts v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>''Roberts v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|428|325|1976}}, {{ussc|431|633|1977}}</ref> the court struck down 5\u20134 statutes providing a [[mandatory death penalty|mandatory death sentence]].\n\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when [[Gary Gilmore (criminal)|Gary Gilmore]] went before a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in [[Utah]]. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\n\nFollowing the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman.

A study by [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] published in ''[[Temple Law Review]]'', surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \"idiosyncrasies\", suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \"special circumstances\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/transparency-death-penalty/ |title = Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.<ref name=\"ReferenceGershowitz\">{{cite web |title= Statewide Capital Punishment: The Case for Eliminating Counties' Role in the Death Penalty |url= http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1255/ |accessdate= March 20, 2016 |author=Adam M.

(If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(b) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim.

State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself.

Federal ''habeas corpus'' is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal ''habeas corpus'' is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal ''habeas corpus'' is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal [[constitutional right]]s. Prisoners may also use federal ''habeas corpus'' suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.<ref>[[House v. Bell]], 126 S. Ct. 2064 (2006)</ref> According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal ''habeas corpus''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when ''habeas corpus'' petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DB1039F932A35757C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Habeas Corpus Studies | date=April 1, 1996 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in ''habeas corpus'' cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walpin|first1=Ned|title=The New Speed-up in Habeas Corpus Appeals|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to ''habeas corpus'' review.\n\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.<ref>see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</ref>\n\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious ''habeas'' procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.<ref>28 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2261 \u2013 2266</ref> Under this program, federal ''habeas corpus'' for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the [[U.S. attorney general]], with a possible appeal of the state to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. {{as of|2016|March}}, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.<ref>{{cite web |title= Court Gives Green Light to Death Penalty Fast-Tracking |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-green-light-death-penalty-fast-tracking-37886309 |publisher= abcnews.go.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Section 1983===\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'', the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] \u2013 codified at {{usc|42|1983}} \u2013 allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nWhile direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-7955/ |title = Glossip v. Gross 576 U.S. ___ (2015) |publisher = justia.com |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that ''habeas corpus'', not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html |title=Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]'' case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the ''Hill'' case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than ''habeas corpus'' to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as [[Clarence Hill (murderer)|Clarence Hill]]'s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\n\n===Execution warrant===\nWhile the [[execution warrant]] is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\n\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Georgia Code \u2013 \u00a7 17-10-34 \u2013 Sentence to specify time period for and place of execution |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-17/chapter-10/article-2/section-17-10-34/ |publisher= law.justia.com |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution of sentences==\n[[File:Death sentences United States (new).png|thumb|right|300px| Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008]]\nIn recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.\n\nAlabama has the highest ''per capita'' rate of death sentences.

[[California]], which is the most populous state, has also the largest death row with over 700 inmates.

[[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\n\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' include: [[Minnesota]] in 1911, [[Capital punishment in Vermont|Vermont]] in 1964, [[Iowa]] and [[Capital punishment in West Virginia|West Virginia]] in 1965 and [[North Dakota]] in 1973. [[Hawaii]] abolished the death penalty in 1948 and [[Alaska]] in 1957, both before their statehood. [[Capital punishment in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] repealed it in 1929 and the [[Capital punishment in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by [[Suffrage|popular vote]] in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later;  Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984.<ref name=\"Ballotpedia\">{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Death_penalty_on_the_ballot|title= Death penalty on the ballot |publisher= ballotpedia.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\n\n===Constitutional law developments===\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\", according to abolitionist [[Hugo Adam Bedau|Hugo Bedau]].<ref>The Courts, the Constitution, and Capital Punishment 118 (1977)</ref>\n\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment's [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] clause must draw its meaning from the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', the court made the first step of what would later be called \"death is different\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases \u2013 a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.\n\n===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===\n{{Further|Furman v. Georgia}}In ''Furman v. Georgia'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \"unitary trial\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-''Furman'' execution was that of [[Luis Monge (mass murderer)|Luis Monge]] on June 2, 1967.\n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be ''per se'' unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of [[Byron White]] and [[Potter Stewart]], expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and [[William O. Douglas]] worried explicitly about [[Race and capital punishment in the United States|racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty]]. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe ''Furman'' decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \"legal bombshell\".<ref name=\"Latzer\"/> The next day, columnist [[Barry Schweid]] wrote that it was \"unlikely\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pAoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3786,38609|title=The Free Lance-Star \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\n===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===\n{{Further|Gregg v. Georgia}}\n[[File:Panorama of United States Supreme Court Building at Dusk.jpg|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court seat in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in ''Furman''. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his ''Furman'' opinion. Other states adopted \"bifurcated\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\n\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''<ref>''Gregg v. Georgia'', {{ussc|428|153|1976}}</ref> and upheld 7\u20132 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any [[mitigating factor]]s exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]''<ref>''Woodson v. North Carolina'', {{ussc|428|280|1976}}</ref> and ''[[Roberts v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>''Roberts v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|428|325|1976}}, {{ussc|431|633|1977}}</ref> the court struck down 5\u20134 statutes providing a [[mandatory death penalty|mandatory death sentence]].\n\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when [[Gary Gilmore (criminal)|Gary Gilmore]] went before a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in [[Utah]]. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\n\nFollowing the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for this offense.\n\nIn the 1980 case ''[[Godfrey v. Georgia]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise [[aggravating factor]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Godfrey v. Georgia |url= https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/420/ |publisher= supreme.justia.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', decided on June 20, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html|title=DARYL RENARD ATKINS, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA|accessdate=August 6, 2006|date=June 20, 2002}}</ref> held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]''<ref>''Roper v. Simmons'', {{ussc|543|551|2005}}</ref> struck down executions for offenders [[Capital punishment for juveniles in the United States|under the age of 18 at the time of the crime]].\n\nIn the 2008 case ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'', the court also held 5\u20134 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including [[child rape]]. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/25/scotus.child.rape/index.html|title=Child rapists can't be executed, Supreme Court rules|first=Bill|last=Mears|publisher=CNN|date=June 25, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] and was criticized by both major party candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |title=Obama Disagrees With High Court on Child Rape Case |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 25, 2008 |author=Sara Kugler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524044856/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Repeal movements and legal challenges===\nIn 2004, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Kansas]] capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective states' highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'' (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of the New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal.

Georgia|Furman]]'', new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] published in ''[[Temple Law Review]]'', surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \"idiosyncrasies\", suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \"special circumstances\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/transparency-death-penalty/ |title = Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.<ref name=\"ReferenceGershowitz\">{{cite web |title= Statewide Capital Punishment: The Case for Eliminating Counties' Role in the Death Penalty |url= http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1255/ |accessdate= March 20, 2016 |author=Adam M.

(If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(b) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim.

State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself.

Federal ''habeas corpus'' is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal ''habeas corpus'' is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal ''habeas corpus'' is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal [[constitutional right]]s. Prisoners may also use federal ''habeas corpus'' suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.<ref>[[House v. Bell]], 126 S. Ct. 2064 (2006)</ref> According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal ''habeas corpus''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when ''habeas corpus'' petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DB1039F932A35757C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Habeas Corpus Studies | date=April 1, 1996 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in ''habeas corpus'' cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walpin|first1=Ned|title=The New Speed-up in Habeas Corpus Appeals|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to ''habeas corpus'' review.\n\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.<ref>see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</ref>\n\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious ''habeas'' procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.<ref>28 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2261 \u2013 2266</ref> Under this program, federal ''habeas corpus'' for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the [[U.S. attorney general]], with a possible appeal of the state to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. {{as of|2016|March}}, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.<ref>{{cite web |title= Court Gives Green Light to Death Penalty Fast-Tracking |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-green-light-death-penalty-fast-tracking-37886309 |publisher= abcnews.go.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Section 1983===\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'', the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] \u2013 codified at {{usc|42|1983}} \u2013 allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nWhile direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-7955/ |title = Glossip v. Gross 576 U.S. ___ (2015) |publisher = justia.com |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that ''habeas corpus'', not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html |title=Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]'' case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the ''Hill'' case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than ''habeas corpus'' to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as [[Clarence Hill (murderer)|Clarence Hill]]'s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\n\n===Execution warrant===\nWhile the [[execution warrant]] is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\n\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Georgia Code \u2013 \u00a7 17-10-34 \u2013 Sentence to specify time period for and place of execution |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-17/chapter-10/article-2/section-17-10-34/ |publisher= law.justia.com |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution of sentences==\n[[File:Death sentences United States (new).png|thumb|right|300px| Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008]]\nIn recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.\n\nAlabama has the highest ''per capita'' rate of death sentences.

It takes its name from the [[genus]] ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'',  the violets and [[pansy|pansies]].\n\nOlder classifications such as the [[Cronquist system]] placed the Violaceae in an [[order (biology)|order]] named after it, the [[Violales]]. However, more recent classifications such as that of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] locate it in the [[Malpighiales]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThough the best-known genus, ''Viola'', is [[herbaceous]], most species are [[shrubs]], [[lianas]] or small [[trees]].{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}  The simple [[leaves]] are alternate or opposite, often with leafy stipules or the stipules are reduced in size. Some species have palmate or deeply dissected leaves. Many species are acaulescent. Inflorescences have solitary flowers or are paniculate; some species have cleistogamous flowers produced after or before the production of typically petaled flowers. Flowers are bisexual or unisexual (e.g. ''Melicytus''), typically zygomorphic or actinomorphic with a calyx of five sepals that are persistent after flowering. Corollae have five mostly unequal petals, and the anterior petal is larger and often spurred. Plants have five stamens with the abaxial stamen often spurred at the base. The gynoecium is a compound pistil of three united carpels with one [[locule]].  Styles are simple, with the ovary superior, and many ovules. The fruits are capsules split by way of three seams.  Seeds have endosperm.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nViolaceae, as a suprageneric rank, was described by [[Batsch]] (1802), under the name of Violariae, and bears his name as the [[botanical authority]].{{sfn|Batsch|1802}} Batsch included eight [[genera]] in this [[Family (biology)|family]].{{sfn|IPNI|2020}} Although Violariae continued to be used by some authors, such as [[Bentham and Hooker]] in 1862 (as Violarieae),{{sfn|Bentham|Hooker|1862}} most authors adopted the alternative name Violaceae, proposed by [[de Lamarck]] and [[de Candolle]] in 1805,{{sfn|de Lamarck|de Candolle|1815}} and later by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz|Gingins]] in 1823.{{sfn|Gingins|1823}} With the establishment of higher suprafamiliar orders, which he called \"Alliances\", [[John Lindley|Lindley]] (1853) placed his Violaceae within the Violales.{{sfn|Lindley|1853}}\n\nViolaceae is one of a large number of [[Families (biology)|families]] within the modern [[eudicot]] [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Malpighiales]]. They are a medium sized family with about 22\u201328 [[genera]], and about 1,000\u20131,100 [[species]]. Most of the genera are [[monotypic]] or [[oligotypic]], but the three genera ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'' (about 600 species), ''[[Rinorea]]'' (about 250 species), and ''[[Hybanthus]]'' include 98% of the species.{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}{{sfn|WFO|2019}}{{sfn|APG IV|2016}} \n\n=== Phylogeny ===\n\nViolaceae, as one of 42 families, is placed in a [[clade]] of 10 families within the order.{{sfn|Xi et al|2012}}{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}\n\n{{Clade| style=line-height:75%;\n|1={{clade\n  |1=[[Oxalidales]]&nbsp;([[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]])\n  |label2=[[Malpighiales]]{{sfn|Xi et al|2012}}\n  |2={{clade\n    |1={{clade\n      |label1=euphorbioids\n      |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Euphorbiaceae]]\n          |2=[[Peraceae]]\n           }}\n        |2={{clade\n          |label1=phyllanthoids\n          |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Picrodendraceae]]\n            |2=[[Phyllanthaceae]]\n             }}\n          |label2=linoids\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Linaceae]]\n            |2=[[Ixonanthaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n        |label1=parietal&nbsp;clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |label1=salicoids\n            |1={{clade\n              |1={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                  |1={{clade\n                    |1=[[Salicaceae]]\n                    |2=[[Scyphostegiaceae]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[Samydaceae]]\n                   }}\n                |2=[[Lacistemataceae]]\n                 }}\n              |2={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                  |1=[[Passifloraceae]]\n                  |2=[[Turneraceae]]\n                   }}\n                |2=[[Malesherbiaceae]]\n                 }}\n               }}\n            |2={{clade\n              |1='''Violaceae'''\n              |2=[[Goupiaceae]]\n               }}\n             }}\n          |2=[[Achariaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Humiriaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n        |label1=clusioids\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |1={{clade\n              |1=[[Hypericaceae]]\n              |2=[[Podostemaceae]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Calophyllaceae]]\n             }}\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Clusiaceae]]\n            |2=[[Bonnetiaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n        |label2=ochnoids\n        |2={{clade\n          |1=[[Ochnaceae]]\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Quiinaceae]]\n            |2=[[Medusagynaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Rhizophoraceae]]\n          |2=[[Erythroxylaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Ctenolophonaceae]]\n         }}\n      |3={{clade\n        |1=[[Pandaceae]]\n        |2=[[Irvingiaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n    |3={{clade\n      |label1=chrysobalanoids\n      |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Chrysobalanaceae]]\n            |2=[[Euphroniaceae]]\n             }}\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Dichapetalaceae]]\n            |2=[[Trigoniaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n        |2=[[Balanopaceae]]\n         }}\n      |label2=malpighioids\n      |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Malpighiaceae]]\n          |2=[[Elatinaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Centroplacaceae]]\n         }}\n      |3=[[Caryocaraceae]]\n      |label4=putranjivoids\n      |4={{clade\n        |1=[[Putranjivaceae]]\n        |2=[[Lophopyxidaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n     }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nMany attempts have been made at an intrafamilial classification, but these have largelybeen artificial, based on floral characteristics, but [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies have revealed that many of these divisions were not [[monophyletic]], partly due to [[homoplasy]].

It takes its name from the [[genus]] ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'',  the violets and [[pansy|pansies]].\n\nOlder classifications such as the [[Cronquist system]] placed the Violaceae in an [[order (biology)|order]] named after it, the [[Violales]]. However, more recent classifications such as that of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] locate it in the [[Malpighiales]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThough the best-known genus, ''Viola'', is [[herbaceous]], most species are [[shrubs]], [[lianas]] or small [[trees]].{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}  The simple [[leaves]] are alternate or opposite, often with leafy stipules or the stipules are reduced in size. Some species have palmate or deeply dissected leaves. Many species are acaulescent. Inflorescences have solitary flowers or are paniculate; some species have cleistogamous flowers produced after or before the production of typically petaled flowers. Flowers are bisexual or unisexual (e.g. ''Melicytus''), typically zygomorphic or actinomorphic with a calyx of five sepals that are persistent after flowering. Corollae have five mostly unequal petals, and the anterior petal is larger and often spurred. Plants have five stamens with the abaxial stamen often spurred at the base. The gynoecium is a compound pistil of three united carpels with one [[locule]].  Styles are simple, with the ovary superior, and many ovules. The fruits are capsules split by way of three seams.  Seeds have endosperm.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nViolaceae, as a suprageneric rank, was described by [[Batsch]] (1802), under the name of Violariae, and bears his name as the [[botanical authority]].{{sfn|Batsch|1802}} Batsch included eight [[genera]] in this [[Family (biology)|family]].{{sfn|IPNI|2020}} Although Violariae continued to be used by some authors, such as [[Bentham and Hooker]] in 1862 (as Violarieae),{{sfn|Bentham|Hooker|1862}} most authors adopted the alternative name Violaceae, proposed by by [[de Lamarck]] and [[de Candolle]] in 1805,{{sfn|de Lamarck|de Candolle|1815}} and later by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz|Gingins]] in 1823.{{sfn|Gingins|1823}} With the establishment of higher suprafamiliar orders, which he called \"Alliances\", [[John Lindley|Lindley]] (1853) placed his Violaceae within the Violales.{{sfn|Lindley|1853}}\n\nViolaceae is one of a large number of [[Families (biology)|families]] within the modern [[eudicot]] [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Malpighiales]]. They are a medium sized family with about 22\u201328 [[genera]], and about 1,000\u20131,100 [[species]]. Most of the genera are [[monotypic]] or [[oligotypic]], but the three genera ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'' (about 600 species), ''[[Rinorea]]'' (about 250 species), and ''[[Hybanthus]]'' include 98% of the species.{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}{{sfn|WFO|2019}}{{sfn|APG IV|2016}} \n\n=== Phylogeny ===\n\nViolaceae, as one of 42 families, is placed in a [[clade]] of 10 families within the order.{{sfn|Xi et al|2012}}{{sfn|Wahlert et al|2014}}\n\n{{Clade| style=line-height:75%;\n|1={{clade\n  |1=[[Oxalidales]]&nbsp;([[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]])\n  |label2=[[Malpighiales]]{{sfn|Xi et al|2012}}\n  |2={{clade\n    |1={{clade\n      |label1=euphorbioids\n      |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Euphorbiaceae]]\n          |2=[[Peraceae]]\n           }}\n        |2={{clade\n          |label1=phyllanthoids\n          |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Picrodendraceae]]\n            |2=[[Phyllanthaceae]]\n             }}\n          |label2=linoids\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Linaceae]]\n            |2=[[Ixonanthaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n        |label1=parietal&nbsp;clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |label1=salicoids\n            |1={{clade\n              |1={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                  |1={{clade\n                    |1=[[Salicaceae]]\n                    |2=[[Scyphostegiaceae]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[Samydaceae]]\n                   }}\n                |2=[[Lacistemataceae]]\n                 }}\n              |2={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                  |1=[[Passifloraceae]]\n                  |2=[[Turneraceae]]\n                   }}\n                |2=[[Malesherbiaceae]]\n                 }}\n               }}\n            |2={{clade\n              |1='''Violaceae'''\n              |2=[[Goupiaceae]]\n               }}\n             }}\n          |2=[[Achariaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Humiriaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n        |label1=clusioids\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |1={{clade\n              |1=[[Hypericaceae]]\n              |2=[[Podostemaceae]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Calophyllaceae]]\n             }}\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Clusiaceae]]\n            |2=[[Bonnetiaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n        |label2=ochnoids\n        |2={{clade\n          |1=[[Ochnaceae]]\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Quiinaceae]]\n            |2=[[Medusagynaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Rhizophoraceae]]\n          |2=[[Erythroxylaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Ctenolophonaceae]]\n         }}\n      |3={{clade\n        |1=[[Pandaceae]]\n        |2=[[Irvingiaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n    |3={{clade\n      |label1=chrysobalanoids\n      |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Chrysobalanaceae]]\n            |2=[[Euphroniaceae]]\n             }}\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Dichapetalaceae]]\n            |2=[[Trigoniaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n        |2=[[Balanopaceae]]\n         }}\n      |label2=malpighioids\n      |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Malpighiaceae]]\n          |2=[[Elatinaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Centroplacaceae]]\n         }}\n      |3=[[Caryocaraceae]]\n      |label4=putranjivoids\n      |4={{clade\n        |1=[[Putranjivaceae]]\n        |2=[[Lophopyxidaceae]]\n         }}\n       }}\n     }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nMany attempts have been made at an intrafamilial classification, but these have largelybeen artificial, based on floral characteristics, but [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies have revealed that many of these divisions were not [[monophyletic]], partly due to [[homoplasy]].
