{"title_page": "Shrinking cities", "text_new": "{{short description|Dense cities that have experienced notable population loss}}\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=May 2014}}\n\n'''Shrinking cities''' or '''urban depopulation''' are [[population density|dense]] cities that have experienced a notable [[depopulation|population loss]]. [[Emigration]] (migration from a place) is a common reason for city shrinkage. Since the [[infrastructure]] of such cities was built to support a larger population, its maintenance can become a serious concern. A related phenomenon is [[counterurbanization]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definition==\n{{further|Urban flight|Urban decay}}\n\n===Origins===.<ref name=Frey>{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=William|title=Migration and Depopulation of the Metropolis: Regional Restructuring or Rural Renaissance|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1987|volume=52|issue=2|pages=240\u2013287|doi=10.2307/2095452|jstor=2095452}}</ref> It was popularized in reference to [[Eastern Europe]] post-[[socialism]], when old industrial regions came under Western [[privatization]] and [[capitalism]].<ref name=Pallagst>{{cite journal|last=Pallagst|first=K.|title=Shrinking cities in the United States of\n\n===Causes===\nThere are various theoretical explanations for the shrinking city phenomenon. Hollander et al.<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> and Glazer<ref name=Glazer/> cite railroads in port cities, the depreciation of national infrastructure (i.e., highways), and suburbanization as possible causes of de-urbanization. Pallagst<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/> also suggests that shrinkage is a response to deindustrialization, as jobs move from the city core to cheaper land on the periphery. This case has been observed in [[Detroit]], where employment opportunities in the automobile industry were moved to the suburbs because of room for expansion and cheaper acreage.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Bontje<ref name=\"Bontje\"/> proposes three factors contributing to urban shrinkage, followed by one suggested by Hollander:\n\n#'''Urban development model''': Based on the Fordist model of [[industrialization]], it suggests that [[urbanization]] is a cyclical process and that urban and regional decline will eventually allow for increased growth<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''One company town/monostructure model''': Cities that focus too much on one branch of economic growth make themselves vulnerable to rapid declines, such as the case with the automobile industry in Flint.<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''Shock therapy model''': Especially in Eastern Europe post-socialism, state-owned companies did not survive privatization, leading to plant closures and massive unemployment.<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''Smart decline''': City planners have utilized this term and inadvertently encouraged decline by \"planning for less&mdash;fewer people, fewer buildings, fewer land uses.\".<ref name=Hollander/> It is a development method focused on improving the quality of life for current residents without taking those residents' needs into account, thus pushing more people out of the city core.<ref name=Hollander />\n\n===Effects===\n\n====Economic====\nThe shrinking of urban populations indicates a changing of economic and planning conditions of a city. Cities begin to 'shrink' from economic decline, usually resulting from war, debt, or lack of production and work force.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\">{{cite journal|last=Schteke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|page=485}}</ref> [[Population decline]] affects a large number of communities, both communities that are far removed from and deep within large urban centers.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/> These communities usually consist of native people and long-term residents, so the initial population is not large. The outflow of people is then detrimental to the production potential and quality of life in these regions, and a decline in employment and productivity ensues.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/>\n\n====Social and infrastructural====\nShrinking cities experience dramatic social changes due to fertility decline, changes in life expectancy, population aging, and household structure. Another reason for this shift is job-driven migration.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/> This causes different household demands, posing a challenge to the urban housing market and the development of new land or urban planning. A decline in population does not inspire confidence in a city, and often deteriorates municipal morale. Coupled with a weak economy, the city and its infrastructure begin to deteriorate from lack of upkeep from citizens.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Political====\nHistorically, shrinking cities have been a taboo topic in politics. Representatives ignored the problem and refused to deal with it, leading many to believe it was not a real problem. Today, urban shrinkage is an acknowledged issue, with many urban planning firms working together to strategize how to combat the implications that affect all dimensions of daily life.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/>\n\n===International perspectives===\n[[File:Partiz\u00e1nska \u013dup\u010da 3TN1.jpg|thumb|[[Partiz\u00e1nska \u013dup\u010da]] in [[Slovakia]].

Several houses still have an [[Urban area|urban]] character.]]\nFormer Socialist regions in Europe and Central Asia have historically suffered the most from population decline and [[deindustrialization]]. East German cities, as well as former Yugoslavian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories, were significantly affected by their weak economic situation after the fall of [[socialism]]. The reunification of European countries yielded both benefits and drawbacks. German cities like [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], for example, experienced a drastic population decline as many people emigrated to western cities like [[Berlin]]. [[Hamburg]] in particular experienced a population boom with record production yields in 1991, after the unification of Germany. Conversely, Leipzig and Dresden suffered from a failing economy and a neglected infrastructure. These cities were built to support a much larger population. However, both Dresden and Leipzig are now growing again, largely at the expense of smaller cities and rural areas. [[Shrinking cities in the United States]] face different issues, with much of the population migrating out of cities to other states for better economic opportunities and safer conditions. Advanced capitalist countries generally have a larger population, so this shift is not as dangerous as it is to post-socialist countries. The United States also has more firms willing to rehabilitate shrinking cities and invest in revitalization efforts. For example, after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] in San Francisco in 1989, the dynamics between the city and its residents provoked change and plans achieved visible improvements in the city. By contrast, cities in Germany have not gotten the same attention. Urban planning projects take a long time to be approved and established. As of now, Leipzig is taking steps toward making the city more nature-oriented and 'green' so that the population can be first stabilized, and then the country can focus on drawing the population back into the city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harms|first=Hans|title=Changes on the Waterfront-Transforming Harbor Areas|url=http://metrostudies.berkeley.edu/pubs/proceedings/Shrinking/7Harms_PA_final%5B2%5D.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Theories  ==\n\nThe observable demographic out-migration and [[disinvestment]] of capital from many industrial cities across the globe following [[World War II]] prompted an academic investigation into the causes of shrinking cities, or urban decline. Serious issues of [[justice]], [[racism]], economic and [[health disparity]], as well as inequitable power relations,  are consequences of the shrinking cities phenomenon. The question is, what causes urban decline and why? While theories do vary, three main categories of influence are widely attributed to urban decline: deindustrialization, [[globalization]], and [[suburbanization]].\n\n=== Deindustrialization ===\n\n[[File:Sectors of US Economy as Percent of GDP 1947-2009.png|thumb|350px|Sectors of the US Economy as percent of GDP 1947\u20132009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Makes It?|url=http://www.63alfred.com/whomakesit/|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nOne theory of shrinking cities is [[deindustrialization]] or, the process of disinvestment from industrial urban centers.<ref name=Clark>Clark, David.

This control was, however, effectively lost to the United States under such programs as the [[Lend-Lease]] and [[Marshall Plan]].<ref name=Lang /> As the global financial market moved from [[London]] to [[New York City]], so too did the influence of capital and investment.\n\nWith the initial decades following World War II dedicated to rebuilding or, readjusting the economic, political and cultural role of Britain within the new [[New world order (politics)|world order]], it wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that major concerns over urban decline emerged.<ref name=Lang />  With industry moving out of Western Europe and into the United States, rapid depopulation of cities and movement into rural areas occurred in Great Britain.<ref name=Lang /> Deindustrialization was advanced further under the [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] privatization policies of the 1980s.<ref name=Lang /> Privatization of industry took away all remaining state protection of manufacturing. With industry now under [[private ownership]], \"free-market\" incentives (along with a strong [[pound sterling|pound]] resulting from [[North Sea Oil]]) pushed further movement of manufacturing out of the United Kingdom.<ref name=Lang />\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], the United Kingdom effectively tried to revamp depopulated and unemployed cities through the enlargement of service sector industry.<ref name=Lang /> This shift from manufacturing to services did not, however, reverse the trend of urban decline observed beginning in 1966, with the exception of London.<ref name=Lang />\n\n==== The case of Leipzig ====\n\n[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0002629 002 Tr\u00fcmmerbeseitigung.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Leipzig after bombing in World War II]]\n\n[[Leipzig]] serves as an example of urban decline on the Eastern half of post-World War II Europe.

With new global [[market competition]], Detroit began to lose its unrivaled position as \"Motor City\".<ref name=Rappaport />  With this falling demand, investment shifted to other locations outside of Detroit. Deindustrialization followed as production rates began to drop.\n\n=== Globalization ===\n\nAs evident from the theory of deindustrialization, political economists and demographers both place huge importance on the global flows of capital and investment in relation to population stability.<ref name=Vernon>{{cite journal | last1 = Vernon | first1 = Raymond | year = 1979 | title = The Product Cycle Hypothesis In A New International Environment | url = | journal = Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 255\u2013267 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0084.1979.mp41004002.x }}</ref>  Many theorists point to the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] as setting the stage for a new globalized age of trade and investment.<ref name=Vernon />  With the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] in addition to the United States' [[economic aid]] programs (i.e., Marshall Plan and Lend-Lease), many academics highlight [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] as a turning point in world economic relations.

Many of these studies, however, focus specifically on the effects of [[globalization]] on urban decline through a critique of [[neoliberalism]]. This contextualization is used to highlight globalization and the [[internationalization]] of production processes as a major driver causing both shrinking cities and destructive [[Development economics|development]] policies.<ref name=Taylor>Taylor, M. \"The product-cycle model: a critique.\" Environment and Planning 18.6 (1986): 751-761.</ref>  Many of these articles draw upon case studies looking at the economic relationship between the United States and [[China]] to clarify and support the main argument presented. The neoliberal critique of globalization argues that a major driver of shrinking cities in developed countries is through the outflow of capital into developing countries.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /> This outflow, according to theorists, is caused by an inability for cities in richer nations to find a productive [[Niche market|niche]] in the increasingly international economic system.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez />  In terms of disinvestment and manufacturer movement, the rise of China's manufacturing industry from United States [[outsourcing]] of cheap labor is often cited as the most applicable current example of the product life-cycle theory.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /> Dependency theory has also been applied to this analysis, arguing that cities outside of global centers experience outflow as inter-urban competition occurs.<ref name=Silverman>Silverman, R.M. \"Rethinking shrinking cities: Peripheral dual cities have arrived.\" Journal of Urban Affairs (2018).</ref> Based on this theory, it is argued that with the exception of a few core cities, all cities eventually shrink as capital flows outward.\n\n=== Suburbanization ===\n\nThe migration of wealthier individuals and families from industrial city centers into surrounding suburban areas is an observable trend seen primarily within the United States during the mid to late 20th century.<ref name=Voith>Voith, Richard. \"City and suburban growth: substitutes or complements?\" Business Review (1992): 21-33.</ref>  Specific theories for this flight vary across disciplines.

The result, according to many academics, was the fundamental decline of urban health across United States cities beginning in the 20th century.<ref name=Rappaport />\n\n[[Image:Home Owners' Loan Corporation Philadelphia redlining map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] 1936 security map of [[Philadelphia]] showing redlining of lower income neighborhoods.<ref>The HOLC maps are part of the records of the FHLBB (RG195) at the [https://www.archives.gov/index.html National Archives II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011145816/http://www.archives.gov/index.html |date=2016-10-11 }}.</ref> Households and businesses in the red zones could not get mortgages or business loans.]]\n\nThe product of white flight was a stratification of wealth with the poorest (and mostly minority) groups in the center of cities and the richest (and mostly white) outside the city in suburban locations.<ref name=Sugrue /> As suburbanization began to increase through to the late 20th century, urban health and infrastructure precipitously dropped. In other words, United States urban areas began to decline.<ref name=Sugrue />\n\nMid-20th-century political policies greatly contributed to urban disinvestment and decline. Both the product and intent of these policies were highly racial oriented.<ref name=Sugrue />  Although discrimination and [[racial segregation]] already existed prior to the passage of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] in 1934, the structural process of discrimination was federally established with the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).<ref name=Rappaport />  The result of the establishment of the FHA was [[redlining]]. Redlining refers to the demarcation of certain districts of poor, minority urban populations where government and private investment were discouraged.<ref name=Sugrue />  The decline of minority [[inner city]] neighborhoods was worsened under the FHA and its policies.<ref name=Sugrue />  Redlined districts could not improve or maintain a thriving population under conditions of withheld mortgage capital.<ref name=Sugrue />\n\n==== Car culture and urban sprawl ====\n\nIn combination with the racial drivers of white flight, the development of a uniquely American [[car culture]] also led to further development of suburbanization and later, [[urban sprawl]].<ref name=Fulton>Fulton, William B. Who sprawls most? How growth patterns differ across the U.S.. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, 2001.</ref>  As car culture made driving \"cool\" and a key cultural aspect of \"American-ness,\" suburban locations proliferated in the imaginations of Americans as the ideal landscape to live during the 20th century.<ref name=Fulton /> Urban decline, under these conditions, only worsened.<ref name=Fulton />\n\n[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]]\n\nThe more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl across American cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Los Angeles]], were only made possible under the conditions of a car culture.<ref name=Fulton />   The impact of this car culture and resulting urban sprawl is, according to academics, threefold. First, although urban sprawl in both shrinking and growing cities have many similar characteristics, sprawl in relation to declining cities may be more rapid with an increasing desire to move out of the poor, inner-city locations.<ref name=Couch />  Second, there are many similarities in the characteristics and features of suburban areas around growing and declining cities.<ref name=Couch />  Third, urban sprawl in declining cities can be contained by improving land use within inner city areas such as implementing micro-parks and implementing [[urban renewal]] projects.<ref name=Couch /> There are many similarities between urban sprawl in relation to both declining and growing cities. This, therefore, provides similar intervention strategies for controlling sprawl from a [[city planning]] point of view.\n\n==Interventions==\nDifferent interventions are adopted by different city governments to deal with the problem of city shrinkage based on their context and development. Governments of shrinking cities such as [[Detroit]] and [[Youngstown]] have used new approaches of adapting to populations well below their peak, rather than seeking economic incentives to boost populations to previous levels before shrinkage and embracing growth models.\n\n===Green retirement city===\nResearch from Europe proposes \"retirement migration\" as one strategy to deal with city shrinkage. The idea is that abandoned properties or vacant lots can be converted into green spaces for retiring seniors migrating from other places. As older individuals migrate into cities they can bring their knowledge and savings to the city for revitalization.<ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nefs | first1 = M | last2 = Alves | first2 = S | last3 = Zasada | first3 = I | last4 = Haase | first4 = D | year = 2013 | title = Shrinking cities as retirement cities?

The green retirement city approach could also have benefits on social inclusion of seniors, such as urban gardening.<ref name=\"retirement\" /> The approach could also act as a \"catalyst in urban renewal for shrinking cities\".<ref name=\"retirement\" /> Accommodations, in the meanwhile, have to be provided including accessibility to community facilities and health care.\n\nEstablishing a green retirement city would be a good approach to avoid tragedies like the [[1995 Chicago heat wave]]. During the heat wave, hundreds of deaths occurred in the city, particularly in the inner neighborhood of the city. Victims were predominantly poor, elderly, African American populations living in the heart of the city.<ref name=\"review\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roper | first1 = R. E. | year = 2003 | title = \"Book Review of \"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago | url = | journal = Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 7 | doi=10.2202/1547-7355.1008}}</ref> Later research pointed out that these victims were socially isolated and had a lack of contact with friends and families.<ref name=\"review\" /> People who were already very ill in these isolated, inner neighborhoods were also affected and might have died sooner than otherwise.<ref name=\"review\" />  The high crime rate in the inner decaying city also accounted for the high rate of deaths as they were afraid to open their windows. Therefore, a green retirement city with sufficient community facilities and support would accommodate needs for elderly population isolated in the poor, inner city communities.\n\n===Right-sizing===\nThe idea of \"right-sizing\" is defined as \"stabilizing dysfunctional markets and distressed neighborhoods by more closely aligning a city's built environment with the needs of existing and foreseeable future populations by adjusting the amount of land available for development.\" <ref name=\"RightSize\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schilling | first1 = Joseph | last2 = Logan | first2 = Jonathan | year = 2008 | title = Greening the rust belt: A green infrastructure model for right sizing America's shrinking cities | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 451\u2013466 | doi=10.1080/01944360802354956}}</ref> Rather than revitalize the entire city, residents are relocated into concentrated or denser neighborhoods.

May 26, 2012</ref> Public amenities are emphasized for improvement in these denser neighborhoods. Abandoned buildings in these less populated areas are demolished and vacant lots are reserved for future green infrastructure.<ref name=\"RightSize\" />\n\nThe city of Detroit has adopted right-sizing approaches in its \"Detroit Work Project\" plan. Many neighborhoods are only 10\u201315% occupied.<ref name=\"guardian\">McGreal, Chris. \"Detroit mayor plans to shrink city by cutting services to some areas\" ''The Guardian'' December 17, 2010</ref> and the plan encourages people to concentrate in nine of the densest neighborhoods.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> Under the plan, the city performs several tasks including: prioritizing [[public safety]], providing reliable transportation and demolition plans for vacant structures.<ref name=\"DetroitWork\">\"Transforming Detroit Handbook\" City of Detroit. Web. 5 March 2014</ref>\n\nAlthough the \"right-sizing\" approach may seem attractive to deal with vast vacant lots and abandoned houses with isolated residents, it can be problematic for people who are incapable of moving into these denser neighborhoods.<ref name=\"io\" /> In the case of Detroit, although residents in decaying neighborhoods are not forced to move into concentrated areas, if they live outside designated neighborhoods they may not get public services they require.<ref name=\"io\" /> This is because communities in shrinking cities often are low-income communities where they are racially segregated.<ref name=\"reading\">{{cite journal | last1 = Morello-Frosch | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Zuk | first2 = Miriam | last3 = Jerrett | first3 = Michael | last4 = Shamasunder | first4 = Bhavna | last5 = Kyle | first5 = Amy D. | year = 2011 | title = Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequality in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 879\u2013887 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153| pmid = 21555471 }}</ref> Such [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and exclusion may \"contribute to psychosocial stress level\" as well and further add burden to the quality of living environments in these communities.<ref name=\"reading\" />\n\n===Smart shrinkage===\nThe idea of \"smart shrinkage\", in some regards, is similar to dominant growth-based models that offer incentives encouraging investment to spur economic and population growth, and reverse shrinkage. However, rather than believing the city can return to previous population levels, the governments embrace shrinkage and accept having a significantly smaller population.<ref name=\"SmartShrink\">Rhodes, James and Russo, John.

July 25, 2013</ref> [[Tax incentive]] programs like Youngstown Initiative have also \"assisted in bringing in and retaining investment throughout the city.\"<ref name=\"SmartNews\">Parris, Terry. \"Youngstown 2010: What shrinkage looks like, what Detroit could learn.\" Model D. Model D, May 4, 2010. Web. 6 March 2014</ref> These practices help attract and preserve investment throughout the city. Since the plan was introduced, many major investments have been made in the city. The downtown Youngstown has been also transformed from a high crime rate area into a vibrant destination.<ref name=\"ceos\" />\n\nNevertheless, there are concerns that the smart shrinkage approach may worsen existing isolation of residents who cannot relocate to more vibrant neighborhoods. [[Environmental justice]] issues may surface from this approach if city governments ignore the types of industries planning investment and neighborhoods that are segregated.\n\n===Land bank===\n[[Land banking|Land banks]] are often quasi-governmental counties or municipal authorities that manage the inventory of surplus vacant lands. They \"allow local jurisdictions to sell, demolish and rehabilitate large numbers of abandoned and tax-delinquent properties.\"<ref name=\"FlintReport\">Fredenburg, Julia. Land Banks to Revive Shrinking Cities: Genesee County, Michigan, Housing Policy & Equitable Development, PUAF U8237, May 10, 2011. Web. 4 March 2014</ref> Sometimes, the state works directly with local governments to allow abandoned properties to have easier and faster resale and to discourage speculative buying.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\nOne of the most famous examples of land banks is the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] Land Bank in the city of [[Flint, Michigan]]. As an industrial city with General Motors as the largest producer, declining car sales with the availability of cheap labor in other cities led to reduction in the labor force of the city. The main reason of the property or land abandonment problem in Flint was the state's tax foreclosure system.<ref name=\"gk\">Gillotti, Teresa and Kildee, Daniel. \"Land Banks as Revitalization Tools: The Example of Genesee County and the City of Flint, Michigan.\"</ref> Abandoned properties were either transferred to private speculators or became state-owned property through foreclosure, which encouraged low-end reuse of tax-reverted land due to the length of time between abandonment and reuse.<ref name=\"gk\" />\n\nThe Land Bank provides a series of programs to revitalize shrinking cities. In the case of Flint, Brownfield Redevelopment for previous polluted lands is controlled by the land bank to allow financing of demolition, redevelopment projects and clean up through [[tax increment financing]].<ref name=\"gk\" /> A \"Greening\" strategy is also promoted by using abandonment as an opportunity for isolated communities to engage in maintenance and improvement of vacant lots.<ref name=\"gk\" /> In the city, there is significant reduction in abandoned properties. Vacant lots are maintained by the banks or sold to adjacent land owners as well.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\nEstablishment of land banks could increase land values and tax revenues for further innovation of the shrinking cities. Nevertheless, The process of acquiring foreclosures can be troublesome as \"it may require involvement on the part of several jurisdictions to obtain clear title,\" which is necessary for redevelopment.<ref name=\"doc\">\"Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks\" Sage Computing, Inc. August 2009</ref> Economic problems that local residents have, including income disparities between local residents, cannot be solved by the land bank, with the addition of increasing rents and land values led by the revitalization of vacant land. Local leaders also lack the authority to interrupt works that Land Banks do.<ref name=\"gk\" /> Environmental justice problems that are from previous polluting industry may not be fully addressed through shrinking city intervention and without opinions from local people. Therefore, a new approach of dealing with these vacant lots will be to work with non-profit local community groups to construct more green open spaces among the declining neighborhoods to reduce vacant lots and create strong community commitments.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\n===Other approaches===\nThere are several other miscellaneous interventions that some cities have used to deal with city shrinkage. One of the interventions would be the series of policies adopted in the city of [[Leipzig]] in East Germany. They include construction of town houses in urban areas and guardian houses with temporary rental-free leases.<ref name=\"PostSocial\">Wiechmann, Thorsten and Volkmann, Anne and Schmitz, Sandra. \"Making Place in Increasingly Empty Spaces-Dealing with Shrinkage in Post-Socialist Cities-The Example of East Germany\" Shrinking Cities-International Perspectives and Policy Implications, Routledge, New York, 2014</ref> Temporary use of private property as public spaces is also encouraged.<ref name=\"PostSocial\" /> Another intervention would be the revitalization of vacant lots or abandoned properties for artistic development and artists interactions such as [[the Village of Arts and Humanities]] in [[North Philadelphia]], where vacant lots and empty buildings are renovated with mosaics, gardens and murals.\n\n==Case study: Detroit, Michigan==\n\n===History of Detroit's changing demographics===\n{{main|Demographic history of Detroit}}\n[[File:AbandonedHouseDelray.jpg|thumb|Abandoned houses in [[Detroit]] - a representation of urban shrinkage.]]\n\nEconomic changes, the [[Automotive industry in the United States]], societal shifts, and political restructuring each affected demographic change and shrinkage in Detroit.<ref name=\"Binelli\">Detroit City is the Place to Be, Henry Holt and Company, 2012.</ref> The city's demographic history plays a key role in the present situation of depopulation in Detroit, and how it has become an issue of [[economic inequality]] and environmental justice.<ref name=\"Briller and Sankar\">Engaging Opportunities in Urban Revitalization: Practicing Detroit Anthropology, American Anthropological Association, 2013.</ref> These political, economic, and societal shifts are outlined below.\n\n====From village to city====\nThough it began as a small village in 1701, Detroit was not an incorporated city until 1815.<ref name=Glazer>{{cite book|last=Glazer|first=Sidney|title=Detroit: A Study in Urban Development|year=1965|publisher=Bookman Associates, Inc.|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=\"Detroit History\">{{cite web|last=Duggan|first=Mike|title=Detroit History|url=https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062413/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|archivedate=2014-05-08}}</ref> By 1820 the city had around 1,400 inhabitants, which increased to 2,200 by 1830.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> By 1850 the city's population of predominantly immigrants had reached 21,000, and by 1860 had surpassed 45,600 total inhabitants.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> This is in part because Detroit was the final stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=\"Detroit History\"/> Even though much of Detroit's African American community was free, racial tensions ran deep among white landowners, and free African Americans often had to deal with slave hunters.<ref name=Martelle>{{cite book|last=Martelle|first=Scott|title=Detroit: A Biography|year=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> In the late 19th Century, roughly half of Detroit's population was foreign-born.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Demographically, the city was home to numerous Austrians, Belgians, Canadians, Germans, English, Scottish, Polish, and Irish groups.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Detroit's residents also lived in clearly defined ethnic and economic neighborhoods from the beginning, segregating English and non-English speakers from Jewish and Catholic, for example.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> In 1825, the Erie Canal and a network of highways, including the Chicago Road, also brought in additional settlers while the city developed.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Throughout this time, Detroit was slowly becoming a commercial center in the Midwest.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The market for manufactured goods slowly grew, as the construction of railroads connected industrial leaders to other prosperous counties in the state, allowing the population to grow further.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> By 1854, the railroad connected Detroit to New York City, permanently opening the city's commercial capacity.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> To support these opportunities, the city also modernized quickly, laying 242 miles of water pipe by 1883 to service the growing population, and contributing to suburbanization.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====The Motor City====\nIndustries native to Detroit, such as manufacturing cigars and kitchen ranges, were quickly overshadowed by the success of Detroit's automobile industry, which allowed the city to explode via population growth. Other cars had been built already in other cities, but Ford's concept of the moving [[assembly line]] \"put the world on wheels\".<ref name=\"Detroit History\"/> The materialization of the automobile industry put Detroit on the map as a global industrial center, allowing dozens of companies to emerge and offer jobs in the automobile industry.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> This had significant implications for population. In 1900, the US Census reported the city's population at 286,000, with over 115,000 of them working.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> By 1910, this number had grown to a total population of 466,000 with 215,000 working.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> During World War I, Detroit was a recipient of thousands of rural African Americans flowing into the city from the South, many of them taking jobs in burgeoning car factories.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> By 1920 over half of the population were [[immigrant generations]], as Detroit was the nexus for many migrating populations.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\nRoad engineers and industry workers flocked to Detroit with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)]].<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The creation of interstate highways and well-maintained roads made it easier to build homes away from the urban city center, increasing [[urban sprawl]] and [[suburbanization]] that would later characterize the region.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Just as the highways allowed for suburban sprawl, they also allowed for segregation between suburbanites (typically white) and working class city-dwellers (immigrants and African Americans) as workers could not afford to move away from the city center.<ref name=Martelle/> As population boomed, close living quarters instigated racially charged conflicts, through \"everyday expressions of white supremacy, and segregation\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> As thousands of workers moved into the city, many lived near the factories to be close to work and fellow union members, creating concentrated neighborhoods of working class citizens.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> These neighborhoods were often class- and race-based, perpetuating social stigmas surrounding race and ethnic group.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Much of this racial and class-based segregation continues today.<ref name=Martelle/> Debates over the trade union of the automobile industry also sparked conflict, turning the working class against many wealthy industry owners and cementing the class system that would come to characterize the population.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Ford's next conception of the automated assembly line changed city demographics, allowing unskilled labor to dominate the automobile industry and pushing skilled craftsmen out, usually further into the suburbs.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /><ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The city developed at a rapid pace, with [[General Motors]] building offices adjacent to poor working class ghettoes, and developing the [[Detroit River]] to serve the needs of the auto industry.<ref name=\"Glazer\" />\n\n====The Great Depression====\n{{main|Great Depression}}\n\nWith the Great Depression, consumers quickly lost faith in the economic boom in Detroit, which was augmented by the eventual market collapse in October 1929.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The huge population of Detroit began to deplete as people lost their homes, savings, and jobs.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Few cities were hit as hard by the Depression as Detroit, and by July 1930, a third of the automobile jobs were lost.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The decline in job availability increased homelessness, unemployment, foreclosures, and out-migration from the city. As working and living conditions declined, particular groups were often targeted for evictions.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> One of the many examples of homelessness and shrinkage that plagued Detroit came in 1935, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt championed razing slum housing in Black Bottom, a low income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Detroit.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> More than 100 families were evicted with the promise of new public housing called the Brewster Homes.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> However, the housing program did not break ground for months, and was not fully replaced until the 1960s.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> In 1933, success was won by the working class through the enactment of the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) union in car companies across Detroit.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Unionization and the UAW's push for social welfare programs helped to build a solid middle class in spite of the Depression.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Unions could negotiate wages and benefits packages, setting the stage for other working class communities across the nation.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====World War II and postwar era====\n{{main|United States home front during World War II}}\n{{see also|Detroit#Postwar Era}}\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor shifted Detroit out of this first major economic slump.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Along with other cities in the U.S., Detroit immediately became part of an all-out total war effort.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Out-migration increased as men and women left to serve in World War II, while industry grew again in Detroit by using automobile factories to produce war items.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Suddenly the problem was not unemployment, but housing shortages and overcrowding as men and women flooded into Detroit for work.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Detroit's second wind and prolific growth attracted more immigrants and newcomers from everywhere.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> The city's physical growth was beginning to cause problems, and in 1927 the city limits were stretched to include 129 square miles.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Housing was not built fast enough to accommodate the influx of new residents.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Detroit's director-secretary of the Detroit Housing Commission claimed, \"There just isn't such a thing as a place to rent in Detroit\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Government services were too limited to keep up with the rapid growth. Those who could moved to the more affluent neighborhoods of Indian Village, North Woodward, and Grosse Point on the outskirts of the city.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Political restructuring and the introduction of new housing commissioners allowed for more public housing to be built.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\nAfter World War II, Detroit experienced another economic boom that was accompanied by increased social pressures.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Automakers profited $1.1 billion between 1945 and 1950,<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> a significant sum as the U.S. became a world superpower in the second half of the century. The ubiquity of cars and highways in Detroit encouraged further sprawl, and created segregated suburbs outside of the city limits.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Martelle argues, \"While Detroit was the region's population base, the majority of the new housing was being built outside the city limits...which were also where the new factories were being built\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Detroit's automobile industry had inevitably driven immigration away from the congested city to cheaper land in the suburbs, taking much of the innovation with it.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> A degree of [[white flight]] was occurring, in which the white population moved to surrounding counties, leaving low income individuals (predominantly African American) in Detroit's city center.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====Decline====\n{{main|Decline of Detroit}}\n{{see also|Public housing in Detroit}}\n\nIn the 1950 mayoral elections, the city passed numerous policy decisions against urban infrastructure development, as [[Albert Cobo]] threatened to raze a [[slum]] to \"offer the land for sale to private individuals for redevelopment\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Cobo won the election, which had dramatic effects on [[public housing]] across the city.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Cobo vetoed many of the proposed project plans, shifted the city's focus to \"urban renewal projects that would eradicate slums\", and replaced the Detroit Housing Commission with private developers.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> None of these plans included new housing for low income residents. In the 1950s, Mayor Cobo also refused federal funds that would have aided in public housing projects, further discriminating against low income communities.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> This decade concretized racial segregation and depopulation in Detroit.<ref name=Sugrue>{{cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref> Housing remained segregated across the city, and more and more whites began to leave for the suburbs.<ref name=\"Sugrue\" /> The engineering of [[Interstate 94 in Michigan]] required many buildings in the city to be removed, including businesses and homes.<ref name=\"Sugrue\" /> The [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]] and other industries also implemented plans to build factories closer to consumer bases and reduce labor costs, causing a severe loss of employment opportunities within the city.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> In the 1970s, Detroit's economic base was exported overseas, with some 28% of equipment and plant investment done in foreign countries.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Industry's move in away from Detroit \"set the course for Detroit's economic collapse\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> As jobs were lost, economic inequality also increased, such that in 1959 the median income of a white family was $7,050, but for an African-American family was $4,370.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> In 1960, Detroit's population was around 1.5 million, 29% African-American and 70% white.<ref name=Williams>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|title=Detroit's Tragic Decline is Largely Due to its Own Race-Based Policies|url=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-perspective/121812-637538-detroit-collapse-was-due-to-race-based-politics.htm?p=full|publisher=Investor's Business Daily}}</ref> In 2012, that number diminished to 701,475, with 82.7% African-American and 10.6% white residents<ref name=Census>{{cite web|last=U.S. Census Bureau|title=Detroit (city), Michigan|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2622000.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715161518/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2622000.html|archivedate=2006-07-15}}</ref>\n\n===Causes of shrinkage===\n{{main|Depopulation}}\n{{see also|Decline of Detroit}}\n\n====Initial causes====\nDetroit's depopulation did not occur overnight, but slowly over a series of decades. Shrinkage is also not a new phenomenon, and is often the converse side of growth.<ref name=Rieniets/> However, shrinkage in Detroit today occurs in stark contrast to the accelerated expansion of other large cities in America.<ref name=\"Rieniets\"/> Jianping and Yasushi argue that an initial cause of depopulation can be due to out-migration, lower [[fertility]] rates, and changes in residential preferences or accessibility that lead to [[suburbanization]].<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\">{{cite journal|last=Jianping|first=Gu|author2=Asami Yasushi |title=Monitoring and modeling for city shrinkage in Japan: phenomena, managing and reviving strategies|journal=AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science|year=2012|pages=216\u2013221}}</ref> The decline of employment as auto makers moved to cheaper property also caused depopulation, as residents moved away from the city or even state to seek jobs.\n\n====Ongoing causes====\nWhile issues such as out-migration and unemployment spurred shrinkage initially, many factors of shrinkage are ongoing and remain prevalent in Detroit. In the suburbs, increased residential development in \"undesirable\" land-use patterns occurs rapidly, such as land utilization for sprawl and the lack of high-rises.<ref name=Ewing/> This threatens local ecosystems and land conservation and influencing further suburbanization.<ref name=Ewing>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by John M. Marzluff ... [et|title=Urban ecology : an international perspective on the interaction between humans and nature|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-73411-8|pages=519\u2013535}}</ref> These suburbs are also indicative of racial segregation between suburb and city. In 2010 the city of Detroit's white population was only 10.61% of total residents, whereas African Americans made up 82.69% (see [[Demographic history of Detroit]]). This racial disparity implies a further cause to Detroit's shrinkage and the lack of opportunities for its remaining residents.\n\nAnother ongoing cause of shrinkage specific to Detroit is deindustrialization,<ref name=\"Rieniets\"/> primarily from Detroit's automobile industry moving to cheaper locations or overseas to Brazil and China. Other industries that supplied car parts to automakers also retreated, resulting in the loss of employment opportunities and financial crises for the entire city.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/><ref name=\"Bernt\"/> With the [[Great Recession]] of 2008, the Big Three automakers \u2013 [[General Motors]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Ford Motor Company]] \u2013 were forced to apply for loans from the federal government in the [[Effects of the 2008\u201310 automotive industry crisis on the United States]]. The subsequent bankruptcy of the automobile industry in cities across Michigan lent themselves to dramatic unemployment and lack of financial investment in the Detroit, further contributing to depopulation.<ref name=Klepper>{{cite journal|last=Klepper|first=S.|title=The evolution of the U.S. automobile industry and Detroit as its capital|journal=9th Congress of the International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society|year=2002}}</ref> With white flight, waning industry left in Detroit, and a lack of [[social mobility]] for remaining residents, the effects of shrinkage were dire.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/> From 2000 to 2004, Detroit lost 5.1% of its overall population, a dramatic decline in such a short period of time.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/>\n\n===Effects of shrinkage===\nBoth the initial and ongoing causes of shrinkage hold dramatic effects on the city and its remaining residents. Divisions between urban and suburban residences imply continued dramatic segregation that is self-perpetuating, resulting in a cycle where African American residents cannot afford to leave because property in the suburbs is too high. Simultaneously, because real estate in predominantly black neighborhoods often has a lower market value than white neighborhoods, white residents can sell their homes and leave for the suburbs, whereas home owners in black neighborhoods have a harder time selling their homes (see [[white flight]]). This depreciates African Americans' sense of [[socioeconomic status]], as inner-city residents struggle to maintain their livelihoods without economic opportunities.<ref name=Hollander/> Another issue that perpetuates this cycle is that many Detroit policy makers and municipal government workers refuse to see shrinkage as a problem, and avoid using the term altogether. Criticisms of the term run the gamut from shrinkage as a natural process, to using population decline as a money-making scheme through \"smart decline\".<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> This is problematic because cities rely most heavily on their municipal governments, despite the cities' lack of political might in state legislatures. Changes to institutions, demographics, and the economy have made non-government coalitions less reliable, which is a large problem faced by shrinking cities today. Many politicians also do not see depopulation as an environmental justice issue, such that the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not yet gotten involved in shrinkage issues in Detroit.<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\nIn inner city Detroit, problems also arise when fewer residents inhabit buildings that cannot be maintained. Instead, these once-beautiful buildings and centers of commerce are slowly falling into disrepair, a sign of inadequate revitalization efforts.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" /> Revitalization has stalled due to municipal politicians' framing of the problem as suburban growth, rather than city shrinkage.<ref name=Hollander/> Building vacancy, demolition of condemned buildings, and underuse of infrastructure are rampant in Detroit, each the effect of decreased population.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\"/> Lower population density in cities like Detroit can also lead to [[brownfield land]] and land wastage, two phenomena that occur after an industry abandons its facilities and leaves behind potential contaminants or [[pollutants]].<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Brownfields Definition|url=http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/overview/glossary.htm|publisher=U.S. EPA|date=2013-11-14}}</ref> Jianping and Yasushi include these as two main effects of city shrinkage in large metropolises:\n\n# [[Brownfield land]] wastage is left in the city core, while expansion of suburbs consumes arable land and endangered ecosystems.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" />\n# Negative effects on residents' quality of life may occur due to lack of infrastructure, resources, community loss, and social segregation.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" />\n\nIncreased suburbanization negatively impacts city residents due to lack of infrastructure and money devoted to the city.<ref name=Ewing/> Other effects include loss of city services, loss of access to public goods due to a shrinking tax base, and loss of money flowing into the city to rebuild infrastructure.<ref name=Pallagst/> Each of these elements further affects the continued inequity between suburban and city residents, as well as the level of opportunity and quality of life available to each Detroit resident.\n\n====Social equity and environmental justice issues====\n{{main|Environmental justice}}\n{{see also|Environmental racism}}\n\nThe causes and effects above lend insight into shrinkage as an environmental justice issue resulting from uneven development and investment disparities in [[urban planning]]. Economic development has been disproportionately skewed toward the suburbs instead of the city's core, in part because of political [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] held by predominantly white suburbs.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Many minority residents in the city's urban center lack the resources and political influence to achieve increased economic development.<ref name= \"Martelle\"/> In cities like Detroit, there is no strong response to the deterioration of the city's core, primarily due to city planners' and politician's failure to prioritize the disadvantaged people and spaces.<ref name= \"Hollander\"/> Policy makers are instead trying to limit urban sprawl and [[gentrify]] abandoned neighborhoods to make them more appealing to the predominantly white people that have moved away from the city.<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> This has broader ripple effects in driving up rents and pushing original residents out of these neighborhoods. For example, the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] district near downtown has been historically used as a site for subsistence fishing, typically by resident African Americans.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\">{{cite journal|last=Kalkirtz|first=V. |author2=M. Martinez |author3=A. Teague|title=Environmental Justice and Fish Consumption Advisories on Detroit River Area of Concern|journal=Doctoral Dissertation, University of Michigan|year=2008}}</ref> Redevelopment of this district in response to shrinkage through casinos, shopping, and expensive condos has led the city to restrict fishing on the riverfront, raising questions of environmental justice inequity.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\"/> Traditional black communities that used this region for subsistence fishing are no longer able to do so, pushing them to seek other forms of subsistence in grocery stores or corner stores.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\"/>\n\nAnother component of shrinkage in cities like Detroit is politicians who refuse to recognize and prioritize shrinkage as a problem, instead focusing on growth in other regions away from the city center.<ref name=Bernt>{{cite journal|last=Bernt|first=M.|title=Partnerships for Demolition: The governance of urban renewal in East Germany's shrinking cities|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=754\u2013769|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00856.x}}</ref><ref name=Schilling>{{cite journal|last=Schilling|first=J.|title=Blueprint Buffalo&mdash;Using Green Infrastructure to Reclaim America's Shrinking Cities|journal=The Future of Shrinking Cities|year=2009|volume=1|pages=149\u2013160}}</ref> Funding is often redirected from the city center to the suburbs, encouraging further sprawl. This is due to a continued political thrust of [[Manifest Destiny]], a concept that regional planners utilize in expanding suburban housing.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> According to this theory, if a city is not expanding, it is not considered successful.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> Without a plan to address shrinkage, it is likely that the surplus of vacant infrastructure and buildings would persist, along with housing problems.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> Some theorize that if left unchecked, this trend of vacancy would continue outside of city limits, affecting the suburbs as well.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> However, this perspective turns shrinkage into a sort of disease with its host as low income communities and [[Person of color|communities of color]], rather than addressing the social and racial segregation that catalyzes it.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> An attempted response to shrinkage and misallocated funding was made by the city through Detroit's Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP). The NSP was designed to address abandoned and condemned housing structures and received federal grant funding, but has not had much effect, failing to distribute funds evenly to historically poor neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\">{{cite web|last=Cockrel|first=Kenneth V.|title=Neighborhood Stabilization Program Plan|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715145614/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-15}}</ref> The NSP's distribution requirements include income status, but no data on race or gender, which are both important factors of shrinkage.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/> The plan has had little effect on remediating vacancies and depopulation in the city's core.\n\nOther problems include the presence of [[brownfields]] near residential areas within the city. Historically, industries placed their facilities near working-class neighborhoods to ensure a broad labor base. However, as Detroit's automobile industry outsourced and moved outside the city limits,<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> these decrepit and polluting facilities remained adjacent to low-income communities of color. The City of Detroit attempted to ameliorate these brownfields by creating the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, \"an authority providing incentives for the city to revitalize underdeveloped or under-utilized properties due to abandonment or environmental contamination\"<ref name=DBRA>{{cite web|last=Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority|title=What is the DBRA?|url=http://michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-rrd-BRA-DetroitBrownfieldRedevelopmentAuthority_297365_7.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit}}</ref>(see also [[Planning and development in Detroit]]). The city outlined three tenets in facilitating the project: brownfield tables and templates, in-house meetings, and coordination with the community.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/> Some of the clean-up programs include turning abandoned lots and buildings into spaces for performances and art, as well as new business, retail, and apartment buildings.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/> Many of the future building projects are expected to bring thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars to the city, helping revitalize depressed areas and assist original residents.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/>  Programs created by the DBRA are intended to create up to 10,000 new housing units in neighborhoods near brownfields, as well as preserve \"greenfields\" from development.<ref name=Poindexter>{{cite journal|last=Poindexter|first=G.|title=Separate and Unequal: A comment on the urban development aspect of brownfields programs|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1\u201322}}</ref> However, much criticism has been raised about the effectiveness of this organization in serving the interests of surrounding neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Poindexter\"/> The DBRA could also be using this brownfield program as a means to gentrify areas of the city to attract new residents instead of providing support for long-term residents.<ref name=\"Poindexter\"/>\n\n===Mitigating shrinkage===\n{{see also|Shrinking cities in the United States}}\n\nEarly efforts to mitigate shrinkage included the Detroit Vacant Land Survey of 1990. This included at attempt at de-densification, in which city residents and development were ushered into and concentrated into some neighborhoods while vacating others.<ref name=\"Hollander et al.\"/><ref name=Sorensen>{{cite web|last=Sorensen|first=Deborah|title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Notes on Detroit|url=http://www.nbm.org/about-us/national-building-museum-online/looking-back-looking-forward.html}}</ref> In this model, residents would be moved into more densely populated areas that were already owned by the city.<ref name=Sorensen/> The Survey and resulting city planning were met by retaliation by residents, and failed.<ref name=Sorensen/> Hollander et al. suggest another model of de-densification includes dispersed vacancy, in which property owners are encouraged by the city to take title to surrounding vacant lots.<ref name=Hollander/>\n\nToday, city planners offer little guidance on how to shrink a city, even when granted funding to help mitigate shrinkage.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> City planning policies are usually directed toward growth and new development, using tools such as comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision regulations, and urban growth boundaries.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> Since the beginning of the 2008 [[Great Recession]], there have been some policies and financial investment in Detroit's infrastructure. The Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP) was proposed by the Planning and Development Department of the City of Detroit,<ref name=NSP>{{cite web|last=Planning and Development Department|title=NSP I|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/DepartmentsandAgencies/PlanningDevelopmentDepartment/NeighborhoodStabilizationPlan(NSP)/NSPI.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit}}</ref> and builds off of Congress' [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]].<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/> The NSP aimed to address the impacts of foreclosure in communities that were detrimentally affected by the economic crisis, and hopes to support market recovery and stabilize neighborhoods.<ref name=Hollander/> However, this policy has been largely ineffective due to city government delays, poor infrastructural planning, and misallocation of funds.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/>\n\nOther efforts to mitigate shrinkage include using occupied-housing-unit density as a metric \"to analyze changes in physical land use associated with population decline in urban neighborhoods\".<ref name=Hollander>{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|title=Moving Toward a Shrinking Cities Metric: Analyzing Land Use Changes Associated with Depopulation in Flint, Michigan|journal=Cityscape|year=2010|volume=12|issue=1|pages=133\u2013152}}</ref> This is a response to government proposed \"smart decline\", a method aimed at gentrification and consolidating abandoned neighborhoods rather than addressing root causes of shrinkage.<ref name=Hollander/> Smart decline has been met with strong opposition in Detroit, especially when city planners were told by outside observers how to shrink \"gracefully\".<ref name=Hollander/> Many smart decline plans are inherently top-down, assume a blank slate at project sites, and require an uninvolved and quiet public opinion.<ref name=Hollander/> This concept's exclusion of community opinion is largely why it has been met by so much opposition. However, Hollander and N\u00e9meth have proposed a version of smart decline that is founded instead on ethics, equity, and social justice, including town hall meetings, public hearings, and the merits of potential solutions.<ref name=Hollander/>\n\nAnother attempt to remedy the shrinkage problem has been to capitalize on the population decline in Detroit's urban core for the benefit of remaining residents. Setting aside abandoned lots and green space for \"recreation, agriculture, green infrastructure, and other non-traditional land uses will benefit existing residents and attract future development, and enable shrinking cities to reinvent themselves as more productive, sustainable, and ecologically sound places\".<ref name=\"Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz, and Popper\">{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|author2=K.

As a result of the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, the emancipated African American population in the city doubled to 50,000 by 1870.<ref name=\"Campanella 2007\" /> The subsequent [[Jim Crow]] laws segregated blacks to more low-lying and marginalized areas of the city, including black Creoles who previously resided in the [[French Quarter]].<ref name=\"Bullard 2009\" /><ref name=\"Campanella 2007\" /><ref name=\"Fussell 2007\" />  However, by 1900 migration to New Orleans slowed, lowering it from the 5th to 12th largest among all American cities, placing it below the growth rate of Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee. This change took place largely because of New Orleans' reliance on agricultural exports that did not require urban laborers. This decline was somewhat lessened by the railway that passed through the city and connected to ocean freighters.\n\nBefore the 20th century, New Orleans' neighborhoods were of mixed race, but a combination of [[Jim Crow]] laws, racially segregated public housing, unequal educational opportunities, white flight, and unequal employment opportunities led to a racially segregated city. During this time, the city shifted from being tripartite to a biracial, meaning individuals were considered to be black or white. PhD Elizabeth Fussell explains how unequal opportunities based on race contributed to economic and geographic disparities in New Orleans over the years:<blockquote> explicitly unequal treatment of those racial groups has been reproduced through an interlocking system of unequal educational opportunities, residential segregation, and blacks were consistently far less likely than whites to complete secondary school, even to present. The effect of racial educational inequity during the \"human capital century\" has been to diminish the labor-market opportunities and life changes of the individuals that lag behind.<ref name=\"Fussell 2007\"/></blockquote> Beginning in 1960, New Orleans began to see population loss, and just before [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit, New Orleans had almost twice as many people living below the poverty level than the national average and a 30% lower average income. The storm worsened population loss and changed the demographics of the city, resulting in an increased proportion of whites population and decreased proportion of black individuals in the years following.<ref name=\"Fussell 2007\"/>\n\n===Causes of shrinkage===\n\n====Before Hurricane Katrina====\nNew Orleans' population began declining in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Hollander 2008\">{{Cite journal\n| last = Justin B.

It was one of the major European centers of learning and culture in music and publishing. After [[World War II]], it became the major urban and trade center within East Germany. Because Leipzig played a large role in the decline of [[Communism]] in [[East Germany]], the city itself also suffered economic drawbacks and declines resulting in a change in landscape, infrastructure and geography. Today, Leipzig is considered a 'shrinking city' because of its rapid population decline and infrastructure devastation. While Leipzig is one of the most livable cities in East Germany and is a prominent cultural center, it is still suffering the repercussions of the last World War, economically, politically and socially.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Causes of shrinkage===\n{{See also|East Germany}}\nAfter World War II, the local economy in Leipzig was deflated and the regional economy desperately needed to be revitalized. The fall of socialist East Germany led to a mass emigration to other areas of the country. The housing vacancy had risen to 20%, and renovations in the older neighborhoods were needed. The post socialist conditions are partly to blame for the state in which many east German cities find themselves in.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar, Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Economic Aspects in Shrinking Cities.

Lingering socialist ideals competed with very democratic western philosophy, causing issues for old and new generations. Integrating east Germany into West Germany has been problematic because of regional variations due to differences in economic performance in the recent years. The whole area suffers from problems like joblessness, population loss, and a lack of renovation. In the case of Leipzig specifically, a dramatic loss of manufacturing jobs and mass out-migration has accelerated the shrinking process. Loss of stock in commercial real estate and housing stock produced a problematic picture to the whole of Germany and Europe in general. The transition from 40 years of socialist rule to a democratic-capitalist economy was not as smooth as expected. The loss of economic and socio-cultural importance did not fare well for Leipzig, or Germany as a whole. Becoming a part of the German Democratic Republic lead to the loss of several national functions of the former unitary state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=15\u201316|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of shrinkage===\nIn 1949, when Leipzig was a part of the German Democratic Republic, the city underwent many infrastructure changes. National and regional industries, like banks and the publishing media, left Leipzig for the capitalist western Germany. The German Democratic Republic prioritized pre-war traditions rather than investing in innovations; the city of Leipzig was to become the industrial center with large-scale mining, which caused pollution in the air and the national and cultural landscape of the city was drastically changed. Villages were torn down to make room for the new machinery and coalfields. This caused inhabitants to leave the area, and at the end of GDR era in 1989, the population shrunk down from a peak of 700,000 to 530,000.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=16|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>  Some neighborhoods were neglected because of their past-socialist nature. These infrastructures then began to disintegrate and there were no initiatives established for maintenance. Nobody wanted to be reminded of communist times. 75% of the local industry was closed down within the years after the reunification of Germany. Small companies took over parts of the formerly state-owned industries, but it was not noticeable due to the large outflux of industry years earlier. Contrary to conventional thinking, the reduced use of water from 700,000m3 to only 165,000m3/day has resulted in higher operation and maintenance costs and will lead to higher long-term investment costs for restructuring the water system, as consumption and revenue continue to decline. <ref>{{cite web |title=Managing shrinking cities in an expanding world |url=https://theconversation.com/managing-shrinking-cities-in-an-expanding-world-91448 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conservation Trust |accessdate=18 March 2019}}</ref> There was huge environmental damage and social costs. The city had turned into a coal producing state, but the energy value of coal was poor, so continuation of coal mining was not economical. The city was destroyed by landscape devastation and air pollution, and the industry was not thriving and would not be continuing in the area. The physical infrastructure of roads, buildings and [[public transportation]] was designed for much larger population than is present, they are too large to represent the current population. The population is now stagnant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities.

The Fordist model of [[industrialization]] was employed, which was characterized by mass standardized production and mass employment in large complexes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=13|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref> This mass production technology created increases in output due to specialization of jobs based on individual workers' skills and top-down management. While the output was unprecedented, this put added pressure on wages causing stagnation. There was an unbalanced relationship between consumption and production in that there was not enough payoff for the working class to incentivize working hard.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amsden|first=Alice|title=Third World Industrialization: 'Global Fordism' Or a New Model?|journal=New Left Review|date=July\u2013August 1990|volume=182}}</ref> \n \n[[Image:Suburbia by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|A suburban [[land use planning|land use]] pattern]]Suburbanization is the growth of areas on the fringes of cities. It is one of the many causes of the increase in [[urban sprawl]].\n[[Human capital]], creativity and competitiveness are key to successfully industrializing the city. Neglected areas of the city were ignored because of their connection to former socialist memories. Instead of renovating, large city centers were built away from the center of the city. These large buildings fell victim to the effects of neglect like decay. Large construction and renovation projects were meant to strengthen the optimistic view on the future of Germany. [[Suburb]]an housing projects were constructed around the city so the houses could be offered to those who left the city earlier. The goal was to offer housing opportunities so that the population would come back and the regional population would not decline too drastically.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 20\">{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=20|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\nThere was a policy of 'restitution before financial compensation' which had an adverse effect on inner city renovation projects. This was an accelerated out-migration to the suburbs and countryside which resulted in many empty houses in the city despite their perfect state of condition after renovation. Stimulating [[suburbanization]] increased the already too large housing stock in the region and failed to mitigate the inner city vacancy problems. The city would do best if the development policy was aimed at modest economic growth and employment was created to stabilize the urban population and prevent a new exodus to the west.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=18|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Census trends===\n{{See also|East Germany#Population}}\nAfter the fall of East Germany, the population of the German Democratic Republic suffered a decline. After the Second World War, there was an out-migration of 3.8 million people from East Germany to West Germany. This was so drastic that East Germany would eventually cease to exist. The rest of Germany felt the only option was to cut off ties completely with Eastern Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar|first=Matt|title=The Power of Freedom: Central and Eastern Europe after 1945|date=April 2010|publisher=Unitas|isbn=978-9949188581|page=58}}</ref>  However, the shift from communist to capitalist gave new employment opportunities in retail, transportation and communication, but this only accounted for a small amount of the economy that was lost. There were not enough people living in the city to make use of these opportunities. Unemployment was not too high at 20%, but still higher than other cities in West Germany and other EU countries. The working-class neighborhoods fell victim to the large-scale vacancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=17|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Efforts to mitigate shrinkage===\nThe new policies are shifting their focus toward stabilizing the current population and adjusting the housing stock to the population size. The city has developed a strategy to adapt housing stock and infrastructure according to a 'shrinking city' model. There will be demolition of housing that were neglected or there is too little demand for living.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 19\">{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=19|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>  These neglected areas are then replaced with parks or squares. The goal is to turn the area into a more attractive and greener, nature-oriented environment (See also [[gentrification]]). This in turn encourages a more spacious livelihood and leads to a higher quality of life, which could potentially attract urban dwellers to these remodeled neighborhoods, as well as land developers.<ref name=\"Schetke 498\">{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|page=498}}</ref>\n\nStimulating owner-occupancy is another important strategy that strengthens the ties between the city and its inhabitants. There is a lack of clients and purchasing power for retailers, which causes problems especially for working-class neighborhoods. There is a public hearing that is held to brainstorm strategies for solving this problem, like focusing exclusively on physical solutions like improvements of housing stock and public space.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 19\"/> Long-term monitoring of sustainable urban open space development at the city district level will also be helpful in the long run. Concrete socio-economic evidence of the benefits that green spaces bring to shrinking cities would be a valuable contribution to the rehabilitation of a shrinking city like Leipzig.<ref name=\"Schetke 498\"/>\n\n===Plans===\nA coherent urban development strategy is hard to find because there are many policy plans, each dealing with different parts of the problem. The government is not to blame completely for the state Leipzig is in as there are many facets of the shrinking city problem that need to be addressed. The government has not failed to find the right solutions, or been too optimistic in their judgements. Leipzig has a bad reputation in other parts of West Germany, which is where most investors come from. Leipzig can claim that they have branches of large office of West German companies like BMW and Porsche, but this does not result in enough jobs or opportunities to push the unemployment rate back to an acceptable level. The politicians and investors should not see the shrinking of the city as negative or a problem that cannot be solved; but that it offers things that other cities do not have like space for innovation, creative subcultures, cheap start-up rents, and an increase of green space for making the city more attractive. The attempt to get the [[2012 Olympics]] to take place in Leipzig brought renewed recognition for the discussion of more building projects. For now, the city needs to focus on stabilizing the current population and lowering the [[unemployment]] rate by increasing opportunities within the city.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 20\"/>\n\n== Environmental justice ==\nA rapidly contracting population is often viewed holistically, as a citywide and sometimes even regional struggle. However, shrinking cities, by their nature and how local officials respond to the phenomena, can have a disproportionate social and environmental impact on the less fortunate, resulting in the emergence of issues relating to environmental injustices. This paradigm was established almost immediately after cities started shrinking in significance during the mid-20th century and persists today in varying forms.\n\n=== Historical precedent ===\nAlthough the concept of [[environmental justice]] and the movement it sparked was formally introduced and popularized starting in the late 1980s, its historical precedent in the context of shrinking cities is rooted in mid-20th century trends that took place in the United States.\n\nIn an American context, historical [[suburbanization]] and subsequent ill-fated [[urban renewal]] efforts are largely why the very poor and people of color are concentrated in otherwise emptied cities, where they are adversely plagued by conditions which are today identified as environmental injustices or [[environmental racism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=36|author=Robert Beuregard|edition=1|editor=Malo Andr\u00e9 Hutson|year=2010}}</ref> These conditions, although created and exacerbated through mid-20th century actions, still persist today in many cases and include: living in close proximity to freeways; living without convenient access, if any, to healthy foods<ref>{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=526|author=Lisa Feldstein|edition=1|editor=Malo Andr\u00e9 Hutson|year=2010}}</ref>  and green space.

These may include an aging population, shifting industries, intentional shrinkage to improve quality of life, or a transitional phase, all of which require different responses and plans.<ref name=Maheshwari>{{cite web|last=Maheshwari|first=Tanvi|title=Redefining Shrinking Cities. The Urban Fringe, Berkeley Planning Journal|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/bpj/2013/12/redefining-shrinking-cities/}}</ref>\n\n===Causes===\nThere are various theoretical explanations for the shrinking city phenomenon. Hollander et al.<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> and Glazer<ref name=Glazer/> cite railroads in port cities, the depreciation of national infrastructure (i.e., highways), and suburbanization as possible causes of de-urbanization. Pallagst<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/> also suggests that shrinkage is a response to deindustrialization, as jobs move from the city core to cheaper land on the periphery. This case has been observed in [[Detroit]], where employment opportunities in the automobile industry were moved to the suburbs because of room for expansion and cheaper acreage.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Bontje<ref name=\"Bontje\"/> proposes three factors contributing to urban shrinkage, followed by one suggested by Hollander:\n\n#'''Urban development model''': Based on the Fordist model of [[industrialization]], it suggests that [[urbanization]] is a cyclical process and that urban and regional decline will eventually allow for increased growth<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''One company town/monostructure model''': Cities that focus too much on one branch of economic growth make themselves vulnerable to rapid declines, such as the case with the automobile industry in Flint.<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''Shock therapy model''': Especially in Eastern Europe post-socialism, state-owned companies did not survive privatization, leading to plant closures and massive unemployment.<ref name=Bontje/>\n#'''Smart decline''': City planners have utilized this term and inadvertently encouraged decline by \"planning for less&mdash;fewer people, fewer buildings, fewer land uses.\".<ref name=Hollander/> It is a development method focused on improving the quality of life for current residents without taking those residents' needs into account, thus pushing more people out of the city core.<ref name=Hollander />\n\n===Effects===\n\n====Economic====\nThe shrinking of urban populations indicates a changing of economic and planning conditions of a city. Cities begin to 'shrink' from economic decline, usually resulting from war, debt, or lack of production and work force.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\">{{cite journal|last=Schteke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|page=485}}</ref> [[Population decline]] affects a large number of communities, both communities that are far removed from and deep within large urban centers.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/> These communities usually consist of native people and long-term residents, so the initial population is not large. The outflow of people is then detrimental to the production potential and quality of life in these regions, and a decline in employment and productivity ensues.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/>\n\n====Social and infrastructural====\nShrinking cities experience dramatic social changes due to fertility decline, changes in life expectancy, population aging, and household structure. Another reason for this shift is job-driven migration.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/> This causes different household demands, posing a challenge to the urban housing market and the development of new land or urban planning. A decline in population does not inspire confidence in a city, and often deteriorates municipal morale. Coupled with a weak economy, the city and its infrastructure begin to deteriorate from lack of upkeep from citizens.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Political====\nHistorically, shrinking cities have been a taboo topic in politics. Representatives ignored the problem and refused to deal with it, leading many to believe it was not a real problem. Today, urban shrinkage is an acknowledged issue, with many urban planning firms working together to strategize how to combat the implications that affect all dimensions of daily life.<ref name=\"Schteke 485\"/>\n\n===International perspectives===\n[[File:Partiz\u00e1nska \u013dup\u010da 3TN1.jpg|thumb|[[Partiz\u00e1nska \u013dup\u010da]] in [[Slovakia]].

Several houses still have an [[Urban area|urban]] character.]]\nFormer Socialist regions in Europe and Central Asia have historically suffered the most from population decline and [[deindustrialization]]. East German cities, as well as former Yugoslavian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories, were significantly affected by their weak economic situation after the fall of [[socialism]]. The reunification of European countries yielded both benefits and drawbacks. German cities like [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], for example, experienced a drastic population decline as many people emigrated to western cities like [[Berlin]]. [[Hamburg]] in particular experienced a population boom with record production yields in 1991, after the unification of Germany. Conversely, Leipzig and Dresden suffered from a failing economy and a neglected infrastructure. These cities were built to support a much larger population. However, both Dresden and Leipzig are now growing again, largely at the expense of smaller cities and rural areas. [[Shrinking cities in the United States]] face different issues, with much of the population migrating out of cities to other states for better economic opportunities and safer conditions. Advanced capitalist countries generally have a larger population, so this shift is not as dangerous as it is to post-socialist countries. The United States also has more firms willing to rehabilitate shrinking cities and invest in revitalization efforts. For example, after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] in San Francisco in 1989, the dynamics between the city and its residents provoked change and plans achieved visible improvements in the city. By contrast, cities in Germany have not gotten the same attention. Urban planning projects take a long time to be approved and established. As of now, Leipzig is taking steps toward making the city more nature-oriented and 'green' so that the population can be first stabilized, and then the country can focus on drawing the population back into the city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harms|first=Hans|title=Changes on the Waterfront-Transforming Harbor Areas|url=http://metrostudies.berkeley.edu/pubs/proceedings/Shrinking/7Harms_PA_final%5B2%5D.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Theories  ==\n\nThe observable demographic out-migration and [[disinvestment]] of capital from many industrial cities across the globe following [[World War II]] prompted an academic investigation into the causes of shrinking cities, or urban decline. Serious issues of [[justice]], [[racism]], economic and [[health disparity]], as well as inequitable power relations,  are consequences of the shrinking cities phenomenon. The question is, what causes urban decline and why? While theories do vary, three main categories of influence are widely attributed to urban decline: deindustrialization, [[globalization]], and [[suburbanization]].\n\n=== Deindustrialization ===\n\n[[File:Sectors of US Economy as Percent of GDP 1947-2009.png|thumb|350px|Sectors of the US Economy as percent of GDP 1947\u20132009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Makes It?|url=http://www.63alfred.com/whomakesit/|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nOne theory of shrinking cities is [[deindustrialization]] or, the process of disinvestment from industrial urban centers.<ref name=Clark>Clark, David.

Many of these studies, however, focus specifically on the effects of [[globalization]] on urban decline through a critique of [[neoliberalism]]. This contextualization is used to highlight globalization and the [[internationalization]] of production processes as a major driver causing both shrinking cities and destructive [[Development economics|development]] policies.<ref name=Taylor>Taylor, M. \"The product-cycle model: a critique.\" Environment and Planning 18.6 (1986): 751-761.</ref>  Many of these articles draw upon case studies looking at the economic relationship between the United States and [[China]] to clarify and support the main argument presented. The neoliberal critique of globalization argues that a major driver of shrinking cities in developed countries is through the outflow of capital into developing countries.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /> This outflow, according to theorists, is caused by an inability for cities in richer nations to find a productive [[Niche market|niche]] in the increasingly international economic system.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez />  In terms of disinvestment and manufacturer movement, the rise of China's manufacturing industry from United States [[outsourcing]] of cheap labor is often cited as the most applicable current example of the product life-cycle theory.<ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /> Dependency theory has also been applied to this analysis, arguing that cities outside of global centers experience outflow as inter-urban competition occurs.<ref name=Silverman>Silverman, R.M. \"Rethinking shrinking cities: Peripheral dual cities have arrived.\" Journal of Urban Affairs (2018).</ref> Based on this theory, it is argued that with the exception of a few core cities, all cities eventually shrink as capital flows outward.\n\n=== Suburbanization ===\n\nThe migration of wealthier individuals and families from industrial city centers into surrounding suburban areas is an observable trend seen primarily within the United States during the mid to late 20th century.<ref name=Voith>Voith, Richard. \"City and suburban growth: substitutes or complements?\" Business Review (1992): 21-33.</ref>  Specific theories for this flight vary across disciplines. The two prevalent cultural phenomenons of white flight and [[car culture]] are, however, consensus trends across academic disciplines.<ref name=Mitchell>{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Clare J.A. | year = 2004 | title = Making sense of counterurbanization | url = | journal = Journal of Rural Studies | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201334 | doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(03)00031-7}}</ref>\n\n==== White flight ====\n\n[[White flight]] generally refers to the movement of large percentages of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] Americans out of racially mixed United States city centers and into largely homogenous suburban areas during the 20th century.<ref name=Rappaport />  The result of this migration, according to theorists studying shrinking cities, was the loss of money and infrastructure from urban centers.<ref name=Rappaport />  As the wealthier and more politically powerful populations fled from cities, so too did funding and government interest. The result, according to many academics, was the fundamental decline of urban health across United States cities beginning in the 20th century.<ref name=Rappaport />\n\n[[Image:Home Owners' Loan Corporation Philadelphia redlining map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] 1936 security map of [[Philadelphia]] showing redlining of lower income neighborhoods.<ref>The HOLC maps are part of the records of the FHLBB (RG195) at the [https://www.archives.gov/index.html National Archives II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011145816/http://www.archives.gov/index.html |date=2016-10-11 }}.</ref> Households and businesses in the red zones could not get mortgages or business loans.]]\n\nThe product of white flight was a stratification of wealth with the poorest (and mostly minority) groups in the center of cities and the richest (and mostly white) outside the city in suburban locations.<ref name=Sugrue /> As suburbanization began to increase through to the late 20th century, urban health and infrastructure precipitously dropped. In other words, United States urban areas began to decline.<ref name=Sugrue />\n\nMid-20th-century political policies greatly contributed to urban disinvestment and decline. Both the product and intent of these policies were highly racial oriented.<ref name=Sugrue />  Although discrimination and [[racial segregation]] already existed prior to the passage of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] in 1934, the structural process of discrimination was federally established with the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).<ref name=Rappaport />  The result of the establishment of the FHA was [[redlining]]. Redlining refers to the demarcation of certain districts of poor, minority urban populations where government and private investment were discouraged.<ref name=Sugrue />  The decline of minority [[inner city]] neighborhoods was worsened under the FHA and its policies.<ref name=Sugrue />  Redlined districts could not improve or maintain a thriving population under conditions of withheld mortgage capital.<ref name=Sugrue />\n\n==== Car culture and urban sprawl ====\n\nIn combination with the racial drivers of white flight, the development of a uniquely American [[car culture]] also led to further development of suburbanization and later, [[urban sprawl]].<ref name=Fulton>Fulton, William B. Who sprawls most? How growth patterns differ across the U.S.. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, 2001.</ref>  As car culture made driving \"cool\" and a key cultural aspect of \"American-ness,\" suburban locations proliferated in the imaginations of Americans as the ideal landscape to live during the 20th century.<ref name=Fulton /> Urban decline, under these conditions, only worsened.<ref name=Fulton />\n\n[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]]\n\nThe more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl across American cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Los Angeles]], were only made possible under the conditions of a car culture.<ref name=Fulton />   The impact of this car culture and resulting urban sprawl is, according to academics, threefold. First, although urban sprawl in both shrinking and growing cities have many similar characteristics, sprawl in relation to declining cities may be more rapid with an increasing desire to move out of the poor, inner-city locations.<ref name=Couch />  Second, there are many similarities in the characteristics and features of suburban areas around growing and declining cities.<ref name=Couch />  Third, urban sprawl in declining cities can be contained by improving land use within inner city areas such as implementing micro-parks and implementing [[urban renewal]] projects.<ref name=Couch /> There are many similarities between urban sprawl in relation to both declining and growing cities. This, therefore, provides similar intervention strategies for controlling sprawl from a [[city planning]] point of view.\n\n==Interventions==\nDifferent interventions are adopted by different city governments to deal with the problem of city shrinkage based on their context and development. Governments of shrinking cities such as [[Detroit]] and [[Youngstown]] have used new approaches of adapting to populations well below their peak, rather than seeking economic incentives to boost populations to previous levels before shrinkage and embracing growth models.\n\n===Green retirement city===\nResearch from Europe proposes \"retirement migration\" as one strategy to deal with city shrinkage. The idea is that abandoned properties or vacant lots can be converted into green spaces for retiring seniors migrating from other places. As older individuals migrate into cities they can bring their knowledge and savings to the city for revitalization.<ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nefs | first1 = M | last2 = Alves | first2 = S | last3 = Zasada | first3 = I | last4 = Haase | first4 = D | year = 2013 | title = Shrinking cities as retirement cities? Opportunities for shrinking cities as green living environments for older individuals | url = | journal = Environment and Planning A | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 1455\u20131473 | doi=10.1068/a45302}}</ref> Retiring seniors are often ignored by the communities if they are not actively participating in community activities. The green retirement city approach could also have benefits on social inclusion of seniors, such as urban gardening.<ref name=\"retirement\" /> The approach could also act as a \"catalyst in urban renewal for shrinking cities\".<ref name=\"retirement\" /> Accommodations, in the meanwhile, have to be provided including accessibility to community facilities and health care.\n\nEstablishing a green retirement city would be a good approach to avoid tragedies like the [[1995 Chicago heat wave]]. During the heat wave, hundreds of deaths occurred in the city, particularly in the inner neighborhood of the city. Victims were predominantly poor, elderly, African American populations living in the heart of the city.<ref name=\"review\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roper | first1 = R. E. | year = 2003 | title = \"Book Review of \"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago | url = | journal = Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 7 | doi=10.2202/1547-7355.1008}}</ref> Later research pointed out that these victims were socially isolated and had a lack of contact with friends and families.<ref name=\"review\" /> People who were already very ill in these isolated, inner neighborhoods were also affected and might have died sooner than otherwise.<ref name=\"review\" />  The high crime rate in the inner decaying city also accounted for the high rate of deaths as they were afraid to open their windows. Therefore, a green retirement city with sufficient community facilities and support would accommodate needs for elderly population isolated in the poor, inner city communities.\n\n===Right-sizing===\nThe idea of \"right-sizing\" is defined as \"stabilizing dysfunctional markets and distressed neighborhoods by more closely aligning a city's built environment with the needs of existing and foreseeable future populations by adjusting the amount of land available for development.\" <ref name=\"RightSize\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schilling | first1 = Joseph | last2 = Logan | first2 = Jonathan | year = 2008 | title = Greening the rust belt: A green infrastructure model for right sizing America's shrinking cities | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 451\u2013466 | doi=10.1080/01944360802354956}}</ref> Rather than revitalize the entire city, residents are relocated into concentrated or denser neighborhoods. Such reorganization encourages residents and businesses in more sparsely populated areas to move into more densely populated areas.<ref name=\"io\">Davis, Lauren. \"Detroit plans to shrink by leaving half the city in the dark\" We Come from Future. May 26, 2012</ref> Public amenities are emphasized for improvement in these denser neighborhoods. Abandoned buildings in these less populated areas are demolished and vacant lots are reserved for future green infrastructure.<ref name=\"RightSize\" />\n\nThe city of Detroit has adopted right-sizing approaches in its \"Detroit Work Project\" plan. Many neighborhoods are only 10\u201315% occupied.<ref name=\"guardian\">McGreal, Chris. \"Detroit mayor plans to shrink city by cutting services to some areas\" ''The Guardian'' December 17, 2010</ref> and the plan encourages people to concentrate in nine of the densest neighborhoods.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> Under the plan, the city performs several tasks including: prioritizing [[public safety]], providing reliable transportation and demolition plans for vacant structures.<ref name=\"DetroitWork\">\"Transforming Detroit Handbook\" City of Detroit. Web. 5 March 2014</ref>\n\nAlthough the \"right-sizing\" approach may seem attractive to deal with vast vacant lots and abandoned houses with isolated residents, it can be problematic for people who are incapable of moving into these denser neighborhoods.<ref name=\"io\" /> In the case of Detroit, although residents in decaying neighborhoods are not forced to move into concentrated areas, if they live outside designated neighborhoods they may not get public services they require.<ref name=\"io\" /> This is because communities in shrinking cities often are low-income communities where they are racially segregated.<ref name=\"reading\">{{cite journal | last1 = Morello-Frosch | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Zuk | first2 = Miriam | last3 = Jerrett | first3 = Michael | last4 = Shamasunder | first4 = Bhavna | last5 = Kyle | first5 = Amy D. | year = 2011 | title = Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequality in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 879\u2013887 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153| pmid = 21555471 }}</ref> Such [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and exclusion may \"contribute to psychosocial stress level\" as well and further add burden to the quality of living environments in these communities.<ref name=\"reading\" />\n\n===Smart shrinkage===\nThe idea of \"smart shrinkage\", in some regards, is similar to dominant growth-based models that offer incentives encouraging investment to spur economic and population growth, and reverse shrinkage. However, rather than believing the city can return to previous population levels, the governments embrace shrinkage and accept having a significantly smaller population.<ref name=\"SmartShrink\">Rhodes, James and Russo, John. Shrinking 'Smart'?: Urban Redevelopment and Shrinkage in Youngstown, Ohio, Urban Geography, 34:3, 305-326</ref> With this model, governments emphasize diversifying their economy and prioritizing funds over relocating people and neighborhoods.\n\n[[File:Youngstown Sheet&Tube Abandoned.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company]] facility in [[Youngstown]]]]\n[[Youngstown 2010]] is an example of such an approach for the city of [[Youngstown]], Ohio. The plan seeks to diversify the city's economy, \"which used to be almost entirely based on manufacturing\".<ref name=\"ceos\">Lawson, Ethan. \"Youngstown: A Shrinking City with Big Ideas\" CEOs for Cities. July 25, 2013</ref> [[Tax incentive]] programs like Youngstown Initiative have also \"assisted in bringing in and retaining investment throughout the city.\"<ref name=\"SmartNews\">Parris, Terry. \"Youngstown 2010: What shrinkage looks like, what Detroit could learn.\" Model D. Model D, May 4, 2010. Web. 6 March 2014</ref> These practices help attract and preserve investment throughout the city. Since the plan was introduced, many major investments have been made in the city. The downtown Youngstown has been also transformed from a high crime rate area into a vibrant destination.<ref name=\"ceos\" />\n\nNevertheless, there are concerns that the smart shrinkage approach may worsen existing isolation of residents who cannot relocate to more vibrant neighborhoods. [[Environmental justice]] issues may surface from this approach if city governments ignore the types of industries planning investment and neighborhoods that are segregated.\n\n===Land bank===\n[[Land banking|Land banks]] are often quasi-governmental counties or municipal authorities that manage the inventory of surplus vacant lands. They \"allow local jurisdictions to sell, demolish and rehabilitate large numbers of abandoned and tax-delinquent properties.\"<ref name=\"FlintReport\">Fredenburg, Julia. Land Banks to Revive Shrinking Cities: Genesee County, Michigan, Housing Policy & Equitable Development, PUAF U8237, May 10, 2011. Web. 4 March 2014</ref> Sometimes, the state works directly with local governments to allow abandoned properties to have easier and faster resale and to discourage speculative buying.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\nOne of the most famous examples of land banks is the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] Land Bank in the city of [[Flint, Michigan]]. As an industrial city with General Motors as the largest producer, declining car sales with the availability of cheap labor in other cities led to reduction in the labor force of the city. The main reason of the property or land abandonment problem in Flint was the state's tax foreclosure system.<ref name=\"gk\">Gillotti, Teresa and Kildee, Daniel. \"Land Banks as Revitalization Tools: The Example of Genesee County and the City of Flint, Michigan.\"</ref> Abandoned properties were either transferred to private speculators or became state-owned property through foreclosure, which encouraged low-end reuse of tax-reverted land due to the length of time between abandonment and reuse.<ref name=\"gk\" />\n\nThe Land Bank provides a series of programs to revitalize shrinking cities. In the case of Flint, Brownfield Redevelopment for previous polluted lands is controlled by the land bank to allow financing of demolition, redevelopment projects and clean up through [[tax increment financing]].<ref name=\"gk\" /> A \"Greening\" strategy is also promoted by using abandonment as an opportunity for isolated communities to engage in maintenance and improvement of vacant lots.<ref name=\"gk\" /> In the city, there is significant reduction in abandoned properties. Vacant lots are maintained by the banks or sold to adjacent land owners as well.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\nEstablishment of land banks could increase land values and tax revenues for further innovation of the shrinking cities. Nevertheless, The process of acquiring foreclosures can be troublesome as \"it may require involvement on the part of several jurisdictions to obtain clear title,\" which is necessary for redevelopment.<ref name=\"doc\">\"Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks\" Sage Computing, Inc. August 2009</ref> Economic problems that local residents have, including income disparities between local residents, cannot be solved by the land bank, with the addition of increasing rents and land values led by the revitalization of vacant land. Local leaders also lack the authority to interrupt works that Land Banks do.<ref name=\"gk\" /> Environmental justice problems that are from previous polluting industry may not be fully addressed through shrinking city intervention and without opinions from local people. Therefore, a new approach of dealing with these vacant lots will be to work with non-profit local community groups to construct more green open spaces among the declining neighborhoods to reduce vacant lots and create strong community commitments.<ref name=\"FlintReport\" />\n\n===Other approaches===\nThere are several other miscellaneous interventions that some cities have used to deal with city shrinkage. One of the interventions would be the series of policies adopted in the city of [[Leipzig]] in East Germany. They include construction of town houses in urban areas and guardian houses with temporary rental-free leases.<ref name=\"PostSocial\">Wiechmann, Thorsten and Volkmann, Anne and Schmitz, Sandra. \"Making Place in Increasingly Empty Spaces-Dealing with Shrinkage in Post-Socialist Cities-The Example of East Germany\" Shrinking Cities-International Perspectives and Policy Implications, Routledge, New York, 2014</ref> Temporary use of private property as public spaces is also encouraged.<ref name=\"PostSocial\" /> Another intervention would be the revitalization of vacant lots or abandoned properties for artistic development and artists interactions such as [[the Village of Arts and Humanities]] in [[North Philadelphia]], where vacant lots and empty buildings are renovated with mosaics, gardens and murals.\n\n==Case study: Detroit, Michigan==\n\n===History of Detroit's changing demographics===\n{{main|Demographic history of Detroit}}\n[[File:AbandonedHouseDelray.jpg|thumb|Abandoned houses in [[Detroit]] - a representation of urban shrinkage.]]\n\nEconomic changes, the [[Automotive industry in the United States]], societal shifts, and political restructuring each affected demographic change and shrinkage in Detroit.<ref name=\"Binelli\">Detroit City is the Place to Be, Henry Holt and Company, 2012.</ref> The city's demographic history plays a key role in the present situation of depopulation in Detroit, and how it has become an issue of [[economic inequality]] and environmental justice.<ref name=\"Briller and Sankar\">Engaging Opportunities in Urban Revitalization: Practicing Detroit Anthropology, American Anthropological Association, 2013.</ref> These political, economic, and societal shifts are outlined below.\n\n====From village to city====\nThough it began as a small village in 1701, Detroit was not an incorporated city until 1815.<ref name=Glazer>{{cite book|last=Glazer|first=Sidney|title=Detroit: A Study in Urban Development|year=1965|publisher=Bookman Associates, Inc.|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=\"Detroit History\">{{cite web|last=Duggan|first=Mike|title=Detroit History|url=https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062413/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|archivedate=2014-05-08}}</ref> By 1820 the city had around 1,400 inhabitants, which increased to 2,200 by 1830.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> By 1850 the city's population of predominantly immigrants had reached 21,000, and by 1860 had surpassed 45,600 total inhabitants.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> This is in part because Detroit was the final stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=\"Detroit History\"/> Even though much of Detroit's African American community was free, racial tensions ran deep among white landowners, and free African Americans often had to deal with slave hunters.<ref name=Martelle>{{cite book|last=Martelle|first=Scott|title=Detroit: A Biography|year=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> In the late 19th Century, roughly half of Detroit's population was foreign-born.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Demographically, the city was home to numerous Austrians, Belgians, Canadians, Germans, English, Scottish, Polish, and Irish groups.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Detroit's residents also lived in clearly defined ethnic and economic neighborhoods from the beginning, segregating English and non-English speakers from Jewish and Catholic, for example.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> In 1825, the Erie Canal and a network of highways, including the Chicago Road, also brought in additional settlers while the city developed.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Throughout this time, Detroit was slowly becoming a commercial center in the Midwest.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The market for manufactured goods slowly grew, as the construction of railroads connected industrial leaders to other prosperous counties in the state, allowing the population to grow further.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> By 1854, the railroad connected Detroit to New York City, permanently opening the city's commercial capacity.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> To support these opportunities, the city also modernized quickly, laying 242 miles of water pipe by 1883 to service the growing population, and contributing to suburbanization.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====The Motor City====\nIndustries native to Detroit, such as manufacturing cigars and kitchen ranges, were quickly overshadowed by the success of Detroit's automobile industry, which allowed the city to explode via population growth. Other cars had been built already in other cities, but Ford's concept of the moving [[assembly line]] \"put the world on wheels\".<ref name=\"Detroit History\"/> The materialization of the automobile industry put Detroit on the map as a global industrial center, allowing dozens of companies to emerge and offer jobs in the automobile industry.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> This had significant implications for population. In 1900, the US Census reported the city's population at 286,000, with over 115,000 of them working.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> By 1910, this number had grown to a total population of 466,000 with 215,000 working.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> During World War I, Detroit was a recipient of thousands of rural African Americans flowing into the city from the South, many of them taking jobs in burgeoning car factories.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> By 1920 over half of the population were [[immigrant generations]], as Detroit was the nexus for many migrating populations.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\nRoad engineers and industry workers flocked to Detroit with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)]].<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The creation of interstate highways and well-maintained roads made it easier to build homes away from the urban city center, increasing [[urban sprawl]] and [[suburbanization]] that would later characterize the region.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Just as the highways allowed for suburban sprawl, they also allowed for segregation between suburbanites (typically white) and working class city-dwellers (immigrants and African Americans) as workers could not afford to move away from the city center.<ref name=Martelle/> As population boomed, close living quarters instigated racially charged conflicts, through \"everyday expressions of white supremacy, and segregation\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> As thousands of workers moved into the city, many lived near the factories to be close to work and fellow union members, creating concentrated neighborhoods of working class citizens.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> These neighborhoods were often class- and race-based, perpetuating social stigmas surrounding race and ethnic group.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Much of this racial and class-based segregation continues today.<ref name=Martelle/> Debates over the trade union of the automobile industry also sparked conflict, turning the working class against many wealthy industry owners and cementing the class system that would come to characterize the population.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Ford's next conception of the automated assembly line changed city demographics, allowing unskilled labor to dominate the automobile industry and pushing skilled craftsmen out, usually further into the suburbs.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /><ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The city developed at a rapid pace, with [[General Motors]] building offices adjacent to poor working class ghettoes, and developing the [[Detroit River]] to serve the needs of the auto industry.<ref name=\"Glazer\" />\n\n====The Great Depression====\n{{main|Great Depression}}\n\nWith the Great Depression, consumers quickly lost faith in the economic boom in Detroit, which was augmented by the eventual market collapse in October 1929.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The huge population of Detroit began to deplete as people lost their homes, savings, and jobs.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Few cities were hit as hard by the Depression as Detroit, and by July 1930, a third of the automobile jobs were lost.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> The decline in job availability increased homelessness, unemployment, foreclosures, and out-migration from the city. As working and living conditions declined, particular groups were often targeted for evictions.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> One of the many examples of homelessness and shrinkage that plagued Detroit came in 1935, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt championed razing slum housing in Black Bottom, a low income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Detroit.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> More than 100 families were evicted with the promise of new public housing called the Brewster Homes.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> However, the housing program did not break ground for months, and was not fully replaced until the 1960s.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> In 1933, success was won by the working class through the enactment of the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) union in car companies across Detroit.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Unionization and the UAW's push for social welfare programs helped to build a solid middle class in spite of the Depression.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Unions could negotiate wages and benefits packages, setting the stage for other working class communities across the nation.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====World War II and postwar era====\n{{main|United States home front during World War II}}\n{{see also|Detroit#Postwar Era}}\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor shifted Detroit out of this first major economic slump.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Along with other cities in the U.S., Detroit immediately became part of an all-out total war effort.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Out-migration increased as men and women left to serve in World War II, while industry grew again in Detroit by using automobile factories to produce war items.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Suddenly the problem was not unemployment, but housing shortages and overcrowding as men and women flooded into Detroit for work.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Detroit's second wind and prolific growth attracted more immigrants and newcomers from everywhere.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> The city's physical growth was beginning to cause problems, and in 1927 the city limits were stretched to include 129 square miles.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Housing was not built fast enough to accommodate the influx of new residents.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Detroit's director-secretary of the Detroit Housing Commission claimed, \"There just isn't such a thing as a place to rent in Detroit\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Government services were too limited to keep up with the rapid growth. Those who could moved to the more affluent neighborhoods of Indian Village, North Woodward, and Grosse Point on the outskirts of the city.<ref name=\"Glazer\" /> Political restructuring and the introduction of new housing commissioners allowed for more public housing to be built.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\nAfter World War II, Detroit experienced another economic boom that was accompanied by increased social pressures.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Automakers profited $1.1 billion between 1945 and 1950,<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> a significant sum as the U.S. became a world superpower in the second half of the century. The ubiquity of cars and highways in Detroit encouraged further sprawl, and created segregated suburbs outside of the city limits.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Martelle argues, \"While Detroit was the region's population base, the majority of the new housing was being built outside the city limits...which were also where the new factories were being built\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Detroit's automobile industry had inevitably driven immigration away from the congested city to cheaper land in the suburbs, taking much of the innovation with it.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> A degree of [[white flight]] was occurring, in which the white population moved to surrounding counties, leaving low income individuals (predominantly African American) in Detroit's city center.<ref name=\"Martelle\" />\n\n====Decline====\n{{main|Decline of Detroit}}\n{{see also|Public housing in Detroit}}\n\nIn the 1950 mayoral elections, the city passed numerous policy decisions against urban infrastructure development, as [[Albert Cobo]] threatened to raze a [[slum]] to \"offer the land for sale to private individuals for redevelopment\".<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> Cobo won the election, which had dramatic effects on [[public housing]] across the city.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Cobo vetoed many of the proposed project plans, shifted the city's focus to \"urban renewal projects that would eradicate slums\", and replaced the Detroit Housing Commission with private developers.<ref name=\"Martelle\" /> None of these plans included new housing for low income residents.

Shrinkage is also not a new phenomenon, and is often the converse side of growth.<ref name=Rieniets/> However, shrinkage in Detroit today occurs in stark contrast to the accelerated expansion of other large cities in America.<ref name=\"Rieniets\"/> Jianping and Yasushi argue that an initial cause of depopulation can be due to out-migration, lower [[fertility]] rates, and changes in residential preferences or accessibility that lead to [[suburbanization]].<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\">{{cite journal|last=Jianping|first=Gu|author2=Asami Yasushi |title=Monitoring and modeling for city shrinkage in Japan: phenomena, managing and reviving strategies|journal=AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science|year=2012|pages=216\u2013221}}</ref> The decline of employment as auto makers moved to cheaper property also caused depopulation, as residents moved away from the city or even state to seek jobs.\n\n====Ongoing causes====\nWhile issues such as out-migration and unemployment spurred shrinkage initially, many factors of shrinkage are ongoing and remain prevalent in Detroit. In the suburbs, increased residential development in \"undesirable\" land-use patterns occurs rapidly, such as land utilization for sprawl and the lack of high-rises.<ref name=Ewing/> This threatens local ecosystems and land conservation and influencing further suburbanization.<ref name=Ewing>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by John M.

In 2010 the city of Detroit's white population was only 10.61% of total residents, whereas African Americans made up 82.69% (see [[Demographic history of Detroit]]). This racial disparity implies a further cause to Detroit's shrinkage and the lack of opportunities for its remaining residents.\n\nAnother ongoing cause of shrinkage specific to Detroit is deindustrialization,<ref name=\"Rieniets\"/> primarily from Detroit's automobile industry moving to cheaper locations or overseas to Brazil and China. Other industries that supplied car parts to automakers also retreated, resulting in the loss of employment opportunities and financial crises for the entire city.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/><ref name=\"Bernt\"/> With the [[Great Recession]] of 2008, the Big Three automakers \u2013 [[General Motors]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Ford Motor Company]] \u2013 were forced to apply for loans from the federal government in the [[Effects of the 2008\u201310 automotive industry crisis on the United States]]. The subsequent bankruptcy of the automobile industry in cities across Michigan lent themselves to dramatic unemployment and lack of financial investment in the Detroit, further contributing to depopulation.<ref name=Klepper>{{cite journal|last=Klepper|first=S.|title=The evolution of the U.S. automobile industry and Detroit as its capital|journal=9th Congress of the International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society|year=2002}}</ref> With white flight, waning industry left in Detroit, and a lack of [[social mobility]] for remaining residents, the effects of shrinkage were dire.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/> From 2000 to 2004, Detroit lost 5.1% of its overall population, a dramatic decline in such a short period of time.<ref name=\"Pallagst\"/>\n\n===Effects of shrinkage===\nBoth the initial and ongoing causes of shrinkage hold dramatic effects on the city and its remaining residents. Divisions between urban and suburban residences imply continued dramatic segregation that is self-perpetuating, resulting in a cycle where African American residents cannot afford to leave because property in the suburbs is too high. Simultaneously, because real estate in predominantly black neighborhoods often has a lower market value than white neighborhoods, white residents can sell their homes and leave for the suburbs, whereas home owners in black neighborhoods have a harder time selling their homes (see [[white flight]]). This depreciates African Americans' sense of [[socioeconomic status]], as inner-city residents struggle to maintain their livelihoods without economic opportunities.<ref name=Hollander/> Another issue that perpetuates this cycle is that many Detroit policy makers and municipal government workers refuse to see shrinkage as a problem, and avoid using the term altogether. Criticisms of the term run the gamut from shrinkage as a natural process, to using population decline as a money-making scheme through \"smart decline\".<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> This is problematic because cities rely most heavily on their municipal governments, despite the cities' lack of political might in state legislatures. Changes to institutions, demographics, and the economy have made non-government coalitions less reliable, which is a large problem faced by shrinking cities today. Many politicians also do not see depopulation as an environmental justice issue, such that the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not yet gotten involved in shrinkage issues in Detroit.<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\nIn inner city Detroit, problems also arise when fewer residents inhabit buildings that cannot be maintained. Instead, these once-beautiful buildings and centers of commerce are slowly falling into disrepair, a sign of inadequate revitalization efforts.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" /> Revitalization has stalled due to municipal politicians' framing of the problem as suburban growth, rather than city shrinkage.<ref name=Hollander/> Building vacancy, demolition of condemned buildings, and underuse of infrastructure are rampant in Detroit, each the effect of decreased population.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\"/> Lower population density in cities like Detroit can also lead to [[brownfield land]] and land wastage, two phenomena that occur after an industry abandons its facilities and leaves behind potential contaminants or [[pollutants]].<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Brownfields Definition|url=http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/overview/glossary.htm|publisher=U.S. EPA|date=2013-11-14}}</ref> Jianping and Yasushi include these as two main effects of city shrinkage in large metropolises:\n\n# [[Brownfield land]] wastage is left in the city core, while expansion of suburbs consumes arable land and endangered ecosystems.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" />\n# Negative effects on residents' quality of life may occur due to lack of infrastructure, resources, community loss, and social segregation.<ref name=\"Jianping and Yasushi\" />\n\nIncreased suburbanization negatively impacts city residents due to lack of infrastructure and money devoted to the city.<ref name=Ewing/> Other effects include loss of city services, loss of access to public goods due to a shrinking tax base, and loss of money flowing into the city to rebuild infrastructure.<ref name=Pallagst/> Each of these elements further affects the continued inequity between suburban and city residents, as well as the level of opportunity and quality of life available to each Detroit resident.\n\n====Social equity and environmental justice issues====\n{{main|Environmental justice}}\n{{see also|Environmental racism}}\n\nThe causes and effects above lend insight into shrinkage as an environmental justice issue resulting from uneven development and investment disparities in [[urban planning]]. Economic development has been disproportionately skewed toward the suburbs instead of the city's core, in part because of political [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] held by predominantly white suburbs.<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> Many minority residents in the city's urban center lack the resources and political influence to achieve increased economic development.<ref name= \"Martelle\"/> In cities like Detroit, there is no strong response to the deterioration of the city's core, primarily due to city planners' and politician's failure to prioritize the disadvantaged people and spaces.<ref name= \"Hollander\"/> Policy makers are instead trying to limit urban sprawl and [[gentrify]] abandoned neighborhoods to make them more appealing to the predominantly white people that have moved away from the city.<ref name=\"Hollander\"/> This has broader ripple effects in driving up rents and pushing original residents out of these neighborhoods. For example, the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] district near downtown has been historically used as a site for subsistence fishing, typically by resident African Americans.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\">{{cite journal|last=Kalkirtz|first=V. |author2=M. Martinez |author3=A. Teague|title=Environmental Justice and Fish Consumption Advisories on Detroit River Area of Concern|journal=Doctoral Dissertation, University of Michigan|year=2008}}</ref> Redevelopment of this district in response to shrinkage through casinos, shopping, and expensive condos has led the city to restrict fishing on the riverfront, raising questions of environmental justice inequity.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\"/> Traditional black communities that used this region for subsistence fishing are no longer able to do so, pushing them to seek other forms of subsistence in grocery stores or corner stores.<ref name=\"Kalkirtz et al.\"/>\n\nAnother component of shrinkage in cities like Detroit is politicians who refuse to recognize and prioritize shrinkage as a problem, instead focusing on growth in other regions away from the city center.<ref name=Bernt>{{cite journal|last=Bernt|first=M.|title=Partnerships for Demolition: The governance of urban renewal in East Germany's shrinking cities|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=754\u2013769|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00856.x}}</ref><ref name=Schilling>{{cite journal|last=Schilling|first=J.|title=Blueprint Buffalo&mdash;Using Green Infrastructure to Reclaim America's Shrinking Cities|journal=The Future of Shrinking Cities|year=2009|volume=1|pages=149\u2013160}}</ref> Funding is often redirected from the city center to the suburbs, encouraging further sprawl. This is due to a continued political thrust of [[Manifest Destiny]], a concept that regional planners utilize in expanding suburban housing.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> According to this theory, if a city is not expanding, it is not considered successful.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> Without a plan to address shrinkage, it is likely that the surplus of vacant infrastructure and buildings would persist, along with housing problems.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> Some theorize that if left unchecked, this trend of vacancy would continue outside of city limits, affecting the suburbs as well.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> However, this perspective turns shrinkage into a sort of disease with its host as low income communities and [[Person of color|communities of color]], rather than addressing the social and racial segregation that catalyzes it.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> An attempted response to shrinkage and misallocated funding was made by the city through Detroit's Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP). The NSP was designed to address abandoned and condemned housing structures and received federal grant funding, but has not had much effect, failing to distribute funds evenly to historically poor neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\">{{cite web|last=Cockrel|first=Kenneth V.|title=Neighborhood Stabilization Program Plan|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715145614/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-15}}</ref> The NSP's distribution requirements include income status, but no data on race or gender, which are both important factors of shrinkage.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/> The plan has had little effect on remediating vacancies and depopulation in the city's core.\n\nOther problems include the presence of [[brownfields]] near residential areas within the city. Historically, industries placed their facilities near working-class neighborhoods to ensure a broad labor base. However, as Detroit's automobile industry outsourced and moved outside the city limits,<ref name=\"Martelle\"/> these decrepit and polluting facilities remained adjacent to low-income communities of color. The City of Detroit attempted to ameliorate these brownfields by creating the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, \"an authority providing incentives for the city to revitalize underdeveloped or under-utilized properties due to abandonment or environmental contamination\"<ref name=DBRA>{{cite web|last=Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority|title=What is the DBRA?|url=http://michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-rrd-BRA-DetroitBrownfieldRedevelopmentAuthority_297365_7.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit}}</ref>(see also [[Planning and development in Detroit]]). The city outlined three tenets in facilitating the project: brownfield tables and templates, in-house meetings, and coordination with the community.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/> Some of the clean-up programs include turning abandoned lots and buildings into spaces for performances and art, as well as new business, retail, and apartment buildings.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/> Many of the future building projects are expected to bring thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars to the city, helping revitalize depressed areas and assist original residents.<ref name=\"DBRA\"/>  Programs created by the DBRA are intended to create up to 10,000 new housing units in neighborhoods near brownfields, as well as preserve \"greenfields\" from development.<ref name=Poindexter>{{cite journal|last=Poindexter|first=G.|title=Separate and Unequal: A comment on the urban development aspect of brownfields programs|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1\u201322}}</ref> However, much criticism has been raised about the effectiveness of this organization in serving the interests of surrounding neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Poindexter\"/> The DBRA could also be using this brownfield program as a means to gentrify areas of the city to attract new residents instead of providing support for long-term residents.<ref name=\"Poindexter\"/>\n\n===Mitigating shrinkage===\n{{see also|Shrinking cities in the United States}}\n\nEarly efforts to mitigate shrinkage included the Detroit Vacant Land Survey of 1990. This included at attempt at de-densification, in which city residents and development were ushered into and concentrated into some neighborhoods while vacating others.<ref name=\"Hollander et al.\"/><ref name=Sorensen>{{cite web|last=Sorensen|first=Deborah|title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Notes on Detroit|url=http://www.nbm.org/about-us/national-building-museum-online/looking-back-looking-forward.html}}</ref> In this model, residents would be moved into more densely populated areas that were already owned by the city.<ref name=Sorensen/> The Survey and resulting city planning were met by retaliation by residents, and failed.<ref name=Sorensen/> Hollander et al. suggest another model of de-densification includes dispersed vacancy, in which property owners are encouraged by the city to take title to surrounding vacant lots.<ref name=Hollander/>\n\nToday, city planners offer little guidance on how to shrink a city, even when granted funding to help mitigate shrinkage.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> City planning policies are usually directed toward growth and new development, using tools such as comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision regulations, and urban growth boundaries.<ref name=\"Schilling\"/> Since the beginning of the 2008 [[Great Recession]], there have been some policies and financial investment in Detroit's infrastructure. The Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP) was proposed by the Planning and Development Department of the City of Detroit,<ref name=NSP>{{cite web|last=Planning and Development Department|title=NSP I|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/DepartmentsandAgencies/PlanningDevelopmentDepartment/NeighborhoodStabilizationPlan(NSP)/NSPI.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit}}</ref> and builds off of Congress' [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]].<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/> The NSP aimed to address the impacts of foreclosure in communities that were detrimentally affected by the economic crisis, and hopes to support market recovery and stabilize neighborhoods.<ref name=Hollander/> However, this policy has been largely ineffective due to city government delays, poor infrastructural planning, and misallocation of funds.<ref name=\"Cockrel et al.\"/>\n\nOther efforts to mitigate shrinkage include using occupied-housing-unit density as a metric \"to analyze changes in physical land use associated with population decline in urban neighborhoods\".<ref name=Hollander>{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|title=Moving Toward a Shrinking Cities Metric: Analyzing Land Use Changes Associated with Depopulation in Flint, Michigan|journal=Cityscape|year=2010|volume=12|issue=1|pages=133\u2013152}}</ref> This is a response to government proposed \"smart decline\", a method aimed at gentrification and consolidating abandoned neighborhoods rather than addressing root causes of shrinkage.<ref name=Hollander/> Smart decline has been met with strong opposition in Detroit, especially when city planners were told by outside observers how to shrink \"gracefully\".<ref name=Hollander/> Many smart decline plans are inherently top-down, assume a blank slate at project sites, and require an uninvolved and quiet public opinion.<ref name=Hollander/> This concept's exclusion of community opinion is largely why it has been met by so much opposition. However, Hollander and N\u00e9meth have proposed a version of smart decline that is founded instead on ethics, equity, and social justice, including town hall meetings, public hearings, and the merits of potential solutions.<ref name=Hollander/>\n\nAnother attempt to remedy the shrinkage problem has been to capitalize on the population decline in Detroit's urban core for the benefit of remaining residents. Setting aside abandoned lots and green space for \"recreation, agriculture, green infrastructure, and other non-traditional land uses will benefit existing residents and attract future development, and enable shrinking cities to reinvent themselves as more productive, sustainable, and ecologically sound places\".<ref name=\"Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz, and Popper\">{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|author2=K.

Much more research has been done on shrinking cities in the U.S., as well as in Detroit in particular.

This change took place largely because of New Orleans' reliance on agricultural exports that did not require urban laborers. This decline was somewhat lessened by the railway that passed through the city and connected to ocean freighters.\n\nBefore the 20th century, New Orleans' neighborhoods were of mixed race, but a combination of [[Jim Crow]] laws, racially segregated public housing, unequal educational opportunities, white flight, and unequal employment opportunities led to a racially segregated city. During this time, the city shifted from being tripartite to a biracial, meaning individuals were considered to be black or white. PhD Elizabeth Fussell explains how unequal opportunities based on race contributed to economic and geographic disparities in New Orleans over the years:<blockquote> explicitly unequal treatment of those racial groups has been reproduced through an interlocking system of unequal educational opportunities, residential segregation, and blacks were consistently far less likely than whites to complete secondary school, even to present. The effect of racial educational inequity during the \"human capital century\" has been to diminish the labor-market opportunities and life changes of the individuals that lag behind.<ref name=\"Fussell 2007\"/></blockquote> Beginning in 1960, New Orleans began to see population loss, and just before [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit, New Orleans had almost twice as many people living below the poverty level than the national average and a 30% lower average income. The storm worsened population loss and changed the demographics of the city, resulting in an increased proportion of whites population and decreased proportion of black individuals in the years following.<ref name=\"Fussell 2007\"/>\n\n===Causes of shrinkage===\n\n====Before Hurricane Katrina====\nNew Orleans' population began declining in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Hollander 2008\">{{Cite journal\n| last = Justin B.

It was one of the major European centers of learning and culture in music and publishing. After [[World War II]], it became the major urban and trade center within East Germany. Because Leipzig played a large role in the decline of [[Communism]] in [[East Germany]], the city itself also suffered economic drawbacks and declines resulting in a change in landscape, infrastructure and geography. Today, Leipzig is considered a 'shrinking city' because of its rapid population decline and infrastructure devastation. While Leipzig is one of the most livable cities in East Germany and is a prominent cultural center, it is still suffering the repercussions of the last World War, economically, politically and socially.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Causes of shrinkage===\n{{See also|East Germany}}\nAfter World War II, the local economy in Leipzig was deflated and the regional economy desperately needed to be revitalized. The fall of socialist East Germany led to a mass emigration to other areas of the country. The housing vacancy had risen to 20%, and renovations in the older neighborhoods were needed.

Lingering socialist ideals competed with very democratic western philosophy, causing issues for old and new generations. Integrating east Germany into West Germany has been problematic because of regional variations due to differences in economic performance in the recent years. The whole area suffers from problems like joblessness, population loss, and a lack of renovation. In the case of Leipzig specifically, a dramatic loss of manufacturing jobs and mass out-migration has accelerated the shrinking process. Loss of stock in commercial real estate and housing stock produced a problematic picture to the whole of Germany and Europe in general. The transition from 40 years of socialist rule to a democratic-capitalist economy was not as smooth as expected. The loss of economic and socio-cultural importance did not fare well for Leipzig, or Germany as a whole. Becoming a part of the German Democratic Republic lead to the loss of several national functions of the former unitary state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=15\u201316|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of shrinkage===\nIn 1949, when Leipzig was a part of the German Democratic Republic, the city underwent many infrastructure changes. National and regional industries, like banks and the publishing media, left Leipzig for the capitalist western Germany. The German Democratic Republic prioritized pre-war traditions rather than investing in innovations; the city of Leipzig was to become the industrial center with large-scale mining, which caused pollution in the air and the national and cultural landscape of the city was drastically changed. Villages were torn down to make room for the new machinery and coalfields. This caused inhabitants to leave the area, and at the end of GDR era in 1989, the population shrunk down from a peak of 700,000 to 530,000.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=16|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>  Some neighborhoods were neglected because of their past-socialist nature. These infrastructures then began to disintegrate and there were no initiatives established for maintenance. Nobody wanted to be reminded of communist times. 75% of the local industry was closed down within the years after the reunification of Germany. Small companies took over parts of the formerly state-owned industries, but it was not noticeable due to the large outflux of industry years earlier. Contrary to conventional thinking, the reduced use of water from 700,000m3 to only 165,000m3/day has resulted in higher operation and maintenance costs and will lead to higher long-term investment costs for restructuring the water system, as consumption and revenue continue to decline. <ref>{{cite web |title=Managing shrinking cities in an expanding world |url=https://theconversation.com/managing-shrinking-cities-in-an-expanding-world-91448 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conservation Trust |accessdate=18 March 2019}}</ref> There was huge environmental damage and social costs. The city had turned into a coal producing state, but the energy value of coal was poor, so continuation of coal mining was not economical. The city was destroyed by landscape devastation and air pollution, and the industry was not thriving and would not be continuing in the area. The physical infrastructure of roads, buildings and [[public transportation]] was designed for much larger population than is present, they are too large to represent the current population.

Neglected areas of the city were ignored because of their connection to former socialist memories. Instead of renovating, large city centers were built away from the center of the city. These large buildings fell victim to the effects of neglect like decay. Large construction and renovation projects were meant to strengthen the optimistic view on the future of Germany. [[Suburb]]an housing projects were constructed around the city so the houses could be offered to those who left the city earlier. The goal was to offer housing opportunities so that the population would come back and the regional population would not decline too drastically.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 20\">{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=20|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\nThere was a policy of 'restitution before financial compensation' which had an adverse effect on inner city renovation projects. This was an accelerated out-migration to the suburbs and countryside which resulted in many empty houses in the city despite their perfect state of condition after renovation. Stimulating [[suburbanization]] increased the already too large housing stock in the region and failed to mitigate the inner city vacancy problems. The city would do best if the development policy was aimed at modest economic growth and employment was created to stabilize the urban population and prevent a new exodus to the west.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=18|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Census trends===\n{{See also|East Germany#Population}}\nAfter the fall of East Germany, the population of the German Democratic Republic suffered a decline.

There were not enough people living in the city to make use of these opportunities. Unemployment was not too high at 20%, but still higher than other cities in West Germany and other EU countries. The working-class neighborhoods fell victim to the large-scale vacancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=17|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}</ref>\n\n===Efforts to mitigate shrinkage===\nThe new policies are shifting their focus toward stabilizing the current population and adjusting the housing stock to the population size.

The goal is to turn the area into a more attractive and greener, nature-oriented environment (See also [[gentrification]]). This in turn encourages a more spacious livelihood and leads to a higher quality of life, which could potentially attract urban dwellers to these remodeled neighborhoods, as well as land developers.<ref name=\"Schetke 498\">{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities.

There is a lack of clients and purchasing power for retailers, which causes problems especially for working-class neighborhoods. There is a public hearing that is held to brainstorm strategies for solving this problem, like focusing exclusively on physical solutions like improvements of housing stock and public space.<ref name=\"Bontje 2004 19\"/> Long-term monitoring of sustainable urban open space development at the city district level will also be helpful in the long run. Concrete socio-economic evidence of the benefits that green spaces bring to shrinking cities would be a valuable contribution to the rehabilitation of a shrinking city like Leipzig.<ref name=\"Schetke 498\"/>\n\n===Plans===\nA coherent urban development strategy is hard to find because there are many policy plans, each dealing with different parts of the problem. The government is not to blame completely for the state Leipzig is in as there are many facets of the shrinking city problem that need to be addressed. The government has not failed to find the right solutions, or been too optimistic in their judgements. Leipzig has a bad reputation in other parts of West Germany, which is where most investors come from. Leipzig can claim that they have branches of large office of West German companies like BMW and Porsche, but this does not result in enough jobs or opportunities to push the unemployment rate back to an acceptable level. The politicians and investors should not see the shrinking of the city as negative or a problem that cannot be solved; but that it offers things that other cities do not have like space for innovation, creative subcultures, cheap start-up rents, and an increase of green space for making the city more attractive. The attempt to get the [[2012 Olympics]] to take place in Leipzig brought renewed recognition for the discussion of more building projects.

However, shrinking cities, by their nature and how local officials respond to the phenomena, can have a disproportionate social and environmental impact on the less fortunate, resulting in the emergence of issues relating to environmental injustices. This paradigm was established almost immediately after cities started shrinking in significance during the mid-20th century and persists today in varying forms.\n\n=== Historical precedent ===\nAlthough the concept of [[environmental justice]] and the movement it sparked was formally introduced and popularized starting in the late 1980s, its historical precedent in the context of shrinking cities is rooted in mid-20th century trends that took place in the United States.\n\nIn an American context, historical [[suburbanization]] and subsequent ill-fated [[urban renewal]] efforts are largely why the very poor and people of color are concentrated in otherwise emptied cities, where they are adversely plagued by conditions which are today identified as environmental injustices or [[environmental racism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=36|author=Robert Beuregard|edition=1|editor=Malo Andr\u00e9 Hutson|year=2010}}</ref> These conditions, although created and exacerbated through mid-20th century actions, still persist today in many cases and include: living in close proximity to freeways; living without convenient access, if any, to healthy foods<ref>{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=526|author=Lisa Feldstein|edition=1|editor=Malo Andr\u00e9 Hutson|year=2010}}</ref>  and green space.

He then settled in the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon]] Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the [[Darling Scarp|Darling Range]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] name for the area was ''Moondyne''. Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses. Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/>\n\nIn August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion and branded it with his own mark. This was effectively horse stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the [[Toodyay, Western Australia|Toodyay]] lockup. Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate's brand-new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day but, while on the run, he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence. Consequently, he received only a three-year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\">{{cite book|author=Elliot, Ian|year=1978|title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-130-4}} Republished in 1998 by Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. {{ISBN|0-85905-244-3}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Johns was serving his sentence, there was a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved.

He was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence and, in early November, he and another prisoner absconded from a work party. They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies. It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname ''Moondyne Joe''. They were finally caught {{Convert|37|km|abbr=off}} east of [[York, Western Australia|York]] by a party of policemen that included [[Tommy Windich]], an [[Aboriginal tracker]]. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Johns was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to [[Fremantle Prison]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Escape ===\nIn April 1866, Johns sent a petition to the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|Chief Justice]], and received four years off his sentence. This was apparently unsatisfactory to him for, in July, he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door. Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again. After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions. Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police. Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Johns formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia. This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and the gang would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success. On 5 September, Johns equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett. The gang then started travelling east along the explorer [[Charles Cooke Hunt|Charles Hunt]]'s established route. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about {{Convert|160|km}} east of York. A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September 1866 at Boodalin Soak, about {{convert|6|km|spell=in}} north-west of the present-day site of the town of [[Westonia, Western Australia|Westonia]], approximately {{convert|300|km}} north-east of [[Perth]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n[[File:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|right|Moondyne Joe's \"escape-proof\" cell]]\n\n=== Hard labour ===\nAs punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Johns received five years' hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to [[Fremantle Prison]], and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special \"escape-proof\" cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with [[Eucalyptus marginata|jarrah]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the [[limestone]] wall of the prison.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn 7 March 1867, Johns escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years. He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him. Also, many convicts were encouraged by Johns' audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn the 25 February 1869, Johns tried to steal some wine from the cellars at [[Houghton Wines|Houghton Winery]]. By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments. When the owner entered the cellar, Johns assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police. He was returned to prison, sentenced to an additional 12 months, half to be in separate confinement, for absconding. On 22 March 1869 he was sentenced to an additional four years in irons for [[Burglary|breaking and entering]]. Johns made at least one more attempt to escape, attempting in February 1871 to create a key for his cell in the carpenter's workshop, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, in April 1871, Comptroller General Wakeford heard from Johns of Hampton's promise. After verifying with Superintendent Lefroy that those words were spoken, Wakeford informed the current governor, [[Frederick Weld]], who agreed that further punishment would be unfair. Johns was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Later life ===\nThe remainder of Johns' life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]]. In 1881, while exploring the countryside around [[Karridale, Western Australia|Karridale]], he discovered [[Moondyne Cave]].\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nIn 1893, Johns' wife Louisa died at the age of 40, and the death affected him greatly. Years after, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill. He died of senile [[dementia]] in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the [[Fremantle Arts Centre]] building) on 13 August 1900, and was buried in [[Fremantle Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\" /> His tombstone bears the word \"rhyddid\", meaning \"freedom\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n\n===Literature and film===\n[[File:John Boyle O'Reilly cph.3a38519.jpg|thumb|left|It has been said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that the tales of Moondyne Joe inspired John Boyle O'Reilly to make his daring escape in 1869]]\n\nWhile Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an [[Ireland|Irish]] political prisoner named [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] was working in a convict road party near [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]].

After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called [[Moondyne|''Moondyne: An Australian Tale'']], whose central character was called Moondyne Joe.

His father died some time in 1833, and Johns and his three brothers took work as [[copper]] [[miner]]s.

The pair were transferred to [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor Prison]] on 21 October 1851, but shortly afterwards Johns was transferred to the [[Woolwich]] [[Hulk (ship type)|prison hulk]] ''Justitia'', probably for [[discipline|disciplinary]] reasons. When the ''Justitia'' was destroyed by fire, he was transferred to the ''Defence''.

He then settled in the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon]] Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the [[Darling Scarp|Darling Range]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] name for the area was ''Moondyne''. Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses. Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/>\n\nIn August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion and branded it with his own mark. This was effectively horse stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the [[Toodyay, Western Australia|Toodyay]] lockup. Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate's brand-new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day but, while on the run, he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence. Consequently, he received only a three-year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\">{{cite book|author=Elliot, Ian|year=1978|title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-130-4}} Republished in 1998 by Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. {{ISBN|0-85905-244-3}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Johns was serving his sentence, there was a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved. His good behaviour earned him a remission on his sentence, and he was released on a ticket of leave in February 1864. He then found work on Henry Martin's<!-- speculate this is the same Martin after whom the suburb in the same area is named--> farm in [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]]. In January 1865 a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] named \"Bright\" belonging to William Wallace was killed, and Johns was accused of the deed.

He was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence and, in early November, he and another prisoner absconded from a work party. They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies. It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname ''Moondyne Joe''. They were finally caught {{Convert|37|km|abbr=off}} east of [[York, Western Australia|York]] by a party of policemen that included [[Tommy Windich]], an [[Aboriginal tracker]]. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Johns was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to [[Fremantle Prison]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Escape ===\nIn April 1866, Johns sent a petition to the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|Chief Justice]], and received four years off his sentence. This was apparently unsatisfactory to him for, in July, he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door. Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again. After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions. Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police. Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Johns formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia. This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and the gang would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success. On 5 September, Johns equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett. The gang then started travelling east along the explorer [[Charles Cooke Hunt|Charles Hunt]]'s established route. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about {{Convert|160|km}} east of York. A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September 1866 at Boodalin Soak, about {{convert|6|km|spell=in}} north-west of the present-day site of the town of [[Westonia, Western Australia|Westonia]], approximately {{convert|300|km}} north-east of [[Perth]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n[[File:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|right|Moondyne Joe's \"escape-proof\" cell]]\n\n=== Hard labour ===\nAs punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Johns received five years' hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to [[Fremantle Prison]], and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special \"escape-proof\" cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with [[Eucalyptus marginata|jarrah]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the [[limestone]] wall of the prison.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn 7 March 1867, Johns escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years. He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him. Also, many convicts were encouraged by Johns' audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn the 25 February 1869, Johns tried to steal some wine from the cellars at [[Houghton Wines|Houghton Winery]]. By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments. When the owner entered the cellar, Johns assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police. He was returned to prison, sentenced to an additional 12 months, half to be in separate confinement, for absconding. On 22 March 1869 he was sentenced to an additional four years in irons for [[Burglary|breaking and entering]]. Johns made at least one more attempt to escape, attempting in February 1871 to create a key for his cell in the carpenter's workshop, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, in April 1871, Comptroller General Wakeford heard from Johns of Hampton's promise. After verifying with Superintendent Lefroy that those words were spoken, Wakeford informed the current governor, [[Frederick Weld]], who agreed that further punishment would be unfair. Johns was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Later life ===\nThe remainder of Johns' life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]].

Years after, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill.

After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called [[Moondyne|''Moondyne: An Australian Tale'']], whose central character was called Moondyne Joe. The book is presented as fiction, and neither the character nor the plot bears much resemblance to the life of Joseph Johns.\n\nIn 1913, O'Reilly's novel was made into a movie entitled ''[[Moondyne#Film|Moondyne]]''.<ref name=\"Routt 2002\">{{cite journal|author=Routt, William D. |year=2002 |title=More Australian than Aristotelian: The Australian Bushranger Film, 1904\u20131914 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/18/oz_western.html |journal=Senses of Cinema |issue=18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224214514/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/18/oz_western.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 }}</ref> Directed by [[W.

As of 2016, the Tejas Mark 1 was in production for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the naval version was undergoing flight tests for Indian Navy (IN).
