Found in southwestern and south-central China\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Horned Lark RWD.jpg|thumb|left|A male at the [[North Carolina Zoo]] in [[Asheboro, North Carolina]], US]]\nUnlike most other [[lark]]s, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern. Except for the central feathers, the tail is mostly black, contrasting with the paler body; this contrast is especially noticeable when the bird is in flight. The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its American name. North America has a number of races distinguished by the face pattern and back colour of males, especially in summer. The southern European mountain race ''E. a. penicillata'' is greyer above, and the yellow of the face pattern is replaced with white.\n\n[[File:Eremophila alpestris -British Columbia, Canada-8.jpg|thumb|right|In [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\nVocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinkling, and weak. The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill.\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\n[[File:Horned_lark.jpg|thumb|left|A lark displaying its horns at the [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge]]]]\n\nThe horned lark breeds across much of North America from the high Arctic south to the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], northernmost Europe and Asia and in the mountains of southeast Europe. There is also an isolated population on a plateau in Colombia. It is mainly resident in the south of its range, but northern populations of this [[passerine]] [[bird]] are [[bird migration|migratory]], moving further south in winter.\n\nThis is a bird of open ground. In Eurasia it breeds above the tree line in mountains and the far north. In most of Europe, it is most often seen on seashore flats in winter, leading to the European name. In the UK it is found as a winter stopover along the coasts and in eastern England. In North America, where there are no other larks to compete with, it is also found on farmland, on prairies, in deserts, on golf courses and airports.\n\n== Breeding and Nesting ==\n[[File:Horned Lark, Eremophila alpestris, nestlings begging, baby birds, gape colors, in nest Alberta Canada (3).jpg|thumb|A nest with three chicks in the oil fields of [[Alberta]], Canada]]\n\tMales defend territories from other males during breeding season and females will occasionally chase away intruding females. Courting is composed of the male singing to the female while flying above her in circles. He then will fold his wings in and dive towards the female, opening his wings and landing just before hitting the ground.<ref>\"Horned Lark - Eremophila alpestris | Wildlife Journal Junior\". nhpbs.org.</ref>\nThe nest site is selected in the early spring by only the female and is either a natural depression in the bare ground or she digs a cavity using her bill and feet.<ref name=\"allaboutbirds.org\">\"Horned Lark Life History, All About Birds, Cornell Lab of Ornithology\". www.allaboutbirds.org.</ref> She will spend 2\u20134 days preparing the site before building her nest. She weaves fines grasses, cornstalks, small roots, and other plant material and lines it with down, fur, feathers, and occasionally lint. The nest totals to be about 3-4 inches in diameter with the interior diameter about 2.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches deep. It has been notes she often adds a \u201cdoorstep\u201d of pebbles, corncobs, or dung on one side of the nest. The speculation is, it is used to cover the excavated dirt and hid her nest more.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Horned Lark\". American Bird Conservancy.</ref>\n\tShe will lay a clutch of 2-5 gray [[bird egg|eggs]] with brown spots, each about 1 inch long and half an inch wide. Incubation will take 10\u201312 days until hatching and then the nestling period will take 8\u201310 days. During the nestling period, the chick is fed and defended by both parents. The A female in the south can lay 2-3 broods a year while in the north, 1 brood a year is more common.<ref>\"Horned Lark\". Audubon. 13 November 2014.</ref>\n The structure of Horned Lark nests can vary depending on the microclimate, prevailing weather and predation risk, revealing flexibility in nesting behaviour to adjust to changing environmental conditions to maintain nest survival and nestling size development.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= de Zwaan, D.R. |author2= Martin, K. |  year=2018| title= Substrate and structure of ground nests have fitness consequences for an alpine songbird| journal=Ibis| volume=160| pages= 790\u2013804| doi=10.1111/ibi.12582 | issue=4}}</ref>\n\n== Status and conservation ==\nHorned Lark populations are declining according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. In 2016, the Partners in Flight Landbird Conservation Plan detailed the Horned Lark as a \u201cCommon Bird in Steep Decline,\u201d but the Horned Lark as of 2016 is not on the State of North America\u2019s Birds\u2019 Watch List.<ref name=\"allaboutbirds.org\"/> This species\u2019 decline could be contributed to the loss of habitat due to agricultural pesticides, the disturbed sites the birds prefer reverting back to forested lands through reforestation efforts, urbanization and human encroachment as well as collisions with wind turbines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the open areas of western North America, horned larks are among the bird species most often killed by wind turbines.<ref>Erickson, W.P., G.

Found in south-western and south-central China\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Horned Lark RWD.jpg|thumb|left|A male at the [[North Carolina Zoo]] in [[Asheboro, North Carolina]], US]]\nUnlike most other [[lark]]s, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern. Except for the central feathers, the tail is mostly black, contrasting with the paler body; this contrast is especially noticeable when the bird is in flight. The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its American name. North America has a number of races distinguished by the face pattern and back colour of males, especially in summer. The southern European mountain race ''E. a. penicillata'' is greyer above, and the yellow of the face pattern is replaced with white.\n\n[[File:Eremophila alpestris -British Columbia, Canada-8.jpg|thumb|right|In [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\nVocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinkling, and weak. The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill.\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\n[[File:Horned_lark.jpg|thumb|left|A lark displaying its horns at the [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge]]]]\n\nThe horned lark breeds across much of North America from the high Arctic south to the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], northernmost Europe and Asia and in the mountains of south-east Europe. There is also an isolated population on a plateau in Colombia. It is mainly resident in the south of its range, but northern populations of this [[passerine]] [[bird]] are [[bird migration|migratory]], moving further south in winter.\n\nThis is a bird of open ground. In Eurasia it breeds above the tree line in mountains and the far north. In most of Europe, it is most often seen on seashore flats in winter, leading to the European name. In the UK it can be found as a winter stopover along the coasts and in eastern England. In North America, where there are no other larks to compete with, it is also found on farmland, on prairies, in deserts, on golf courses and airports.\n\n== Breeding and Nesting ==\n[[File:Horned Lark, Eremophila alpestris, nestlings begging, baby birds, gape colors, in nest Alberta Canada (3).jpg|thumb|A nest with three chicks in the oil fields of [[Alberta]], Canada]]\n\tMales defend territories from other males during breeding season and females will occasionally chase away intruding females. Courting is composed of the male singing to the female while flying above her in circles. He then will fold his wings in and dive towards the female, opening his wings and landing just before hitting the ground<ref>\"Horned Lark - Eremophila alpestris | Wildlife Journal Junior\". nhpbs.org.</ref>.\nThe nest site is selected in the early spring by only the female and is either a natural depression in the bare ground or she digs a cavity using her bill and feet<ref>\"Horned Lark Life History, All About Birds, Cornell Lab of Ornithology\". www.allaboutbirds.org.</ref>. She will spend 2-4 days preparing the site before building her nest. She weaves fines grasses, cornstalks, small roots, and other plant material and lines it with down, fur, feathers, and occasionally lint. The nest totals to be about 3-4 inches in diameter with the interior diameter about 2.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches deep. It has been notes she often adds a \u201cdoorstep\u201d of pebbles, corncobs, or dung on one side of the nest. The speculation is, it is used to cover the excavated dirt and hid her nest more<ref>\"Horned Lark\". American Bird Conservancy.</ref>.\n\tShe will lay a clutch of 2-5 gray [[bird egg|eggs]] with brown spots, each about 1 inch long and half an inch wide. Incubation will take 10-12 days until hatching and then the nestling period will take 8-10 days. During the nestling period, the chick is fed and defended by both parents. The A female in the south can lay 2-3 broods a year while in the north, 1 brood a year is more common<ref>\"Horned Lark\". Audubon. 13 November 2014.</ref>.\n The structure of Horned Lark nests can vary depending on the microclimate, prevailing weather and predation risk, revealing flexibility in nesting behaviour to adjust to changing environmental conditions to maintain nest survival and nestling size development.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= de Zwaan, D.R. |author2= Martin, K. |  year=2018| title= Substrate and structure of ground nests have fitness consequences for an alpine songbird| journal=Ibis| volume=160| pages= 790\u2013804| doi=10.1111/ibi.12582 | issue=4}}</ref>\n\n== Status and conservation ==\nHorned Lark populations are declining according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey.
