This curved path was shown by [[Galileo]] to be a [[parabola]], but may also be a line in the special case when it is thrown directly upwards. The study of such motions is called [[ballistics]], and such a trajectory is a [[Ballistic Trajectories|ballistic trajectory]]. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward [[acceleration]]. Because of the object's [[inertia]], no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity [[Vector component|component]] of the object. Taking other forces into account, such as [[friction]] from [[aerodynamic drag]] or internal propulsion such as in a [[rocket]], requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics.\n\nBallistics (gr. \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ('ba'llein'), \"to throw\") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\n\n[[Image:Mplwp ballistic trajectories velocities.svg|right|thumb|320px|Trajectories of a projectile with air drag and varying initial velocities]]\n\nThe elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, and therefore require [[numerical methods]] to address.\n\n== The initial velocity ==\nLet the projectile be launched with an [[Velocity|initial velocity]] <math> \\mathbf{v} (0) \\equiv \\mathbf{v}_0 </math>, which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{0x}\\mathbf{i} + v_{0y}\\mathbf{j} </math>.\nThe components <math> v_{0x} </math> and <math> v_{0y} </math> can be found if the initial launch angle, <math> \\theta </math>, is known:\n:<math> v_{0x} = v_0\\cos\\theta </math>,\n:<math> v_{0y} = v_0\\sin\\theta </math>\n\n== Kinematic quantities of projectile motion ==\nIn projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of ''compound motion'' established by [[Galileo]] in 1638,<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Leiden, 1638, p.249</ref> and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion <ref>Nolte, David D., Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018) pp. 39-63.</ref>.\n[[File:Compound Motion.gif|thumb|The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other.]]\nA ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an [[Ellipse|elliptic]] trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a [[black hole]] of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic [[orbit]] around that black hole, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular, parabolic or [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun). In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed.\n\n=== Acceleration ===\nSince there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to <math> \\mathbf{v}_0 \\cos\\theta </math>. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to <var>g</var>.<ref>The <var>g</var> is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]]. (<math> 9.81 m/s^2 </math> near the surface of the Earth).</ref> The components of the acceleration are:\n\n:<math> a_x = 0 </math>,\n:<math> a_y = g </math>.\n\n=== Velocity ===\nThe horizontal component of the [[velocity]] of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly,<ref>decreasing when the object goes upward, and increasing when it goes downward</ref> because the acceleration due to gravity is constant. The accelerations in the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> directions can be integrated to solve for the components of velocity at any time <var>t</var>, as follows:\n:<math> v_x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) </math>,\n:<math> v_y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - gt </math>.\nThe magnitude of the velocity (under the [[Pythagorean theorem]], also known as the triangle law):\n:<math> v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 \\ } </math>.\n\n=== Displacement ===\n[[File:Ferde hajitas3.svg|thumb|250px|Displacement and coordinates of parabolic throwing]]\nAt any time <math> t </math>, the projectile's horizontal and vertical [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] are:\n:<math> x = v_0 t \\cos(\\theta) </math>,\n:<math> y = v_0 t \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 </math>.\nThe magnitude of the displacement is:\n:<math> \\Delta r=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 \\ } </math>.\n\nConsider the equations,\n:<math> x = v_0 t \\cos(\\theta) , y = v_0 t\\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 </math>.\nIf <var>t</var> is eliminated between these two equations the following equation is obtained:\n:<math> y = \\tan(\\theta) \\cdot x-\\frac{g}{2v^2_{0}\\cos^2 \\theta} \\cdot x^2 </math>.\nSince <var>g</var>, <var>\u03b8</var>, and <var>v<sub>0</sub></var> are constants, the above equation is of the form \n:<math> y=ax+bx^2 </math>,\nin which <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic. The axis of the parabola is vertical.\n\nIf the projectile's position (x,y) and launch angle (&theta; or &alpha;) are known, the initial velocity can be found solving for <var> v<sub>0</sub></var> in the aforementioned parabolic equation:\n\n:<math> v_0 = \\sqrt{{x^2 g} \\over {x \\sin 2\\theta - 2y \\cos^2\\theta}} </math>.\n\n== Time of flight or total time of the whole journey ==\nThe total time <var>t</var> for which the projectile remains in the air is called the time of flight.\n:<math> y = v_0 t \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 </math>\n\nAfter the flight, the projectile returns to the horizontal axis (x-axis), so <math> y=0 </math>.\n:<math> 0 = v_0 t \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 </math>\n\n:<math> v_0 t \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 </math>\n\n:<math> v_0 \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}gt </math>\n\n:<math> t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} </math>\n\nNote that we have neglected air resistance on the projectile.\n\nIf the starting point is at height <var>y<sub>0</sub></var> with respect to the point of impact, the time of flight is:\n: <math> t = \\frac{d}{v \\cos\\theta} = \\frac{v \\sin \\theta + \\sqrt{(v \\sin \\theta)^2 + 2gy_0}}{g} </math>\n\nAs above, this expression can be reduced to\n\n: <math> t = \\frac{v\\sin{\\theta} + \\sqrt{(v\\sin{\\theta})^{2}}}{g} = \\frac{v\\sin{\\theta} + v\\sin{\\theta}}{g} = \\frac{2v\\sin{\\theta}}{g} = \\frac{2v\\sin{(45)}}{g} = \\frac{2v\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{g} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v}{g}</math>\n\nif <var>\u03b8</var> is 45\u00b0 and <var>y<sub>0</sub></var> is 0.\n\n== Maximum height of projectile ==\n[[File:Ferde hajitas4.svg|thumb|250px|Maximum height of projectile]]\nThe greatest height that the object will reach is known as the peak of the object's motion.\nThe increase in height will last until <math> v_y=0 </math>, that is,\n:<math> 0=v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - gt_h </math>.\nTime to reach the maximum height(h):\n:<math> t_h = \\frac{v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} </math>.\nFor the vertical displacement of the maximum height of projectile:\n:<math> h = v_0 t_h \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} gt^2_h </math>\n:<math> h = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} </math> .\n{{clear}}\n\n== Relation between horizontal range and maximum height ==\nThe relation between the range <var>R</var> on the horizontal plane and the maximum height <var>h</var> reached at <math> \\frac{t_d}{2} </math> is:\n:<math> h = \\frac{R\\tan\\theta}{4} </math>\n\n=== Proof ===\n\n<math> h = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin^2\\theta}{2g} </math>\n:<math> R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g} </math>\n:<math> \\frac{h}{R} = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin^2\\theta}{2g} </math> \u00d7 <math> \\frac{g}{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta} </math>\n:<math> \\frac{h}{R} = \\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{4\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta} </math>\n<math> h = \\frac{R\\tan\\theta}{4} </math>.\n\n== Maximum distance of projectile ==\n{{main|Range of a projectile}}\n[[File:Ferde hajitas5.svg|thumb|250px|The maximum distance of projectile]]\nThe range and the maximum height of the projectile does not depend upon its mass.

This formula allows one to find the angle of launch needed without the restriction of <math> y=0 </math>.\n\nOne can also ask what launch angle allows the lowest possible launch velocity. This occurs when the two solutions above are equal, implying that the quantity under the square root sign is zero. This requires solving a quadratic equation for <math> v^2 </math>, and we find\n:<math> v^2/g=y+\\sqrt{y^2+x^2}. </math>\nThis gives\n:<math> \\theta=\\arctan\\left(y/x+\\sqrt{y^2/x^2+1}\\right). </math>\n\nIf we denote the angle whose tangent is {{mvar|y/x}} by {{mvar|\u03b1}}, then\n:<math> \\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\sin\\alpha+1}{\\cos\\alpha} </math>\n:<math> \\tan(\\pi/2-\\theta)=\\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\sin\\alpha+1} </math>\n:<math> \\cos^2(\\pi/2-\\theta)=\\frac 12(\\sin\\alpha+1) </math>\n:<math> 2\\cos^2(\\pi/2-\\theta)-1=\\cos(\\pi/2-\\alpha) </math>\nThis implies\n:<math> \\theta = \\pi/2 - \\frac 12(\\pi/2-\\alpha). </math>\n\nIn other words, the launch should be at the angle halfway between the target and Zenith (vector opposite to Gravity)\n\n== Total Path Length of the Trajectory ==\nThe length of the parabolic arc traced by a projectile, given that the height of launch and landing is the same and that there is no air resistance, is given by the formula:\n\n<math>\\frac{v^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{2g} \\left ( 2 \\sec\\theta \\tan\\theta - \\ln \\left | \\frac{1 - \\sin\\theta}{1 + \\sin\\theta}  \\right |\\right )</math>\n\nwhere <math>v</math> is the initial velocity, <math>\\theta</math> is the launch angle and <math>g</math> is the acceleration due to gravity as a positive value.

This is only valid at [[Reynolds number]] below about 1000. In air, which has a [[kinematic viscosity]] around 0.15&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s this means that the product of speed and diameter must be less than about 150&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s which is obviously not usually the case. We do this though so that the equations describing the particle's motion are easily solved. At higher values of speed times diameter (high Reynolds number) the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the particle's velocity (see [[drag equation]]). Here, <math>v_0</math>,<math>v_x</math> and <math>v_y</math> will be used to denote the initial velocity, the velocity along the direction of <var>x</var> and the velocity along the direction of <var>y</var>, respectively. The mass of the projectile will be denoted by <var>m</var>. For the derivation only the case where <math> 0^o \\le \\theta \\le 180^o </math> is considered. Again, the projectile is fired from the origin (0,0).\n\n[[Image:Free body diagram2.png|right|thumb|320px|Free body diagram of a body on which only gravity and air resistance acts]]\n\nThe [[free body diagram]] on the right is for a projectile that experiences air resistance and the effects of gravity. Here, air resistance is assumed to be in the direction opposite of the projectile's velocity. <math>F_{air} = -kv</math> (actually <math> F_{air} = -k v^2 </math> is more realistic, but not used here, to ensure an analytic solution,) is written due to the initial assumption of direct proportionality implies that the air resistance and the velocity differ only by a constant arbitrary factor with units of N*s/m.\n\nThe relationships that represent the motion of the particle are derived by [[Newton's Second Law]], both in the x and y directions. \nIn the x direction <math> \\Sigma F = -kv_x = ma_x </math> and in the y direction <math> \\Sigma F = -kv_y - mg = ma_y </math>.\n\nThis implies that:\n\n<math> a_x = \\frac{-kv_x}{m} = \\frac{dv_x}{dt} </math> (1),\n\nand\n\n<math> a_y = \\frac{1}{m}(-kv_y - mg) = \\frac{-kv_y}{m} - g = \\frac{dv_y}{dt} </math> (2)\n\nSolving (1) is an elementary [[differential equation]], thus the steps leading to a unique solution for <var>v<sub>x</sub></var> and, subsequently, <var>x</var> will not be enumerated.

In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy to get to the same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in [[spaceflight]].<ref>[https://definedterm.com/a/document/10803 Ballistic Missile Defense, Glossary, v. 3.0], [[US Department of Defense]], June 1997.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Projectile Motion}}\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Motion of an object given an initial velocity which then follows a path determined entirely by gravity}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Expert needed|reason=Contains various high-level info without any references.|date=November 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:ParabolicWaterTrajectory.jpg|thumb|250px|Parabolic water motion trajectory]]\n[[File:Ferde hajitas2.svg|thumb|250px|Components of initial velocity of parabolic throwing]]\n'''Projectile motion''' is a form of [[motion (physics)|motion]] experienced by an object or particle (a [[projectile]]) that is projected near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of [[gravity]] only (in particular, the effects of [[air resistance]] are assumed to be negligible). This curved path was shown by [[Galileo]] to be a [[parabola]], but may also be a line in the special case when it is thrown directly upwards. The study of such motions is called [[ballistics]], and such a trajectory is a [[Ballistic Trajectories|ballistic trajectory]]. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward [[acceleration]]. Because of the object's [[inertia]], no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity [[Vector component|component]] of the object. Taking other forces into account, such as [[friction]] from [[aerodynamic drag]] or internal propulsion such as in a [[rocket]], requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics.\n\nBallistics (gr. \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ('ba'llein'), \"to throw\") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\n\n[[Image:Mplwp ballistic trajectories velocities.svg|right|thumb|320px|Trajectories of a projectile with air drag and varying initial velocities]]\n\nThe elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, and therefore require [[numerical methods]] to address.\n\n== The initial velocity ==\nLet the projectile be launched with an [[Velocity|initial velocity]] <math> \\mathbf{v} (0) \\equiv \\mathbf{v}_0 </math>, which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{0x}\\mathbf{i} + v_{0y}\\mathbf{j} </math>.\nThe components <math> v_{0x} </math> and <math> v_{0y} </math> can be found if the initial launch angle, <math> \\theta </math>, is known:\n:<math> v_{0x} = v_0\\cos\\theta </math>,\n:<math> v_{0y} = v_0\\sin\\theta </math>\n\n== Kinematic quantities of projectile motion ==\nIn projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of ''compound motion'' established by [[Galileo]] in 1638,<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Leiden, 1638, p.249</ref> and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion <ref>Nolte, David D., Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018) pp. 39-63.</ref>.\n[[File:Compound Motion.gif|thumb|The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other.]]\nA ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an [[Ellipse|elliptic]] trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a [[black hole]] of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic [[orbit]] around that black hole, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular, parabolic or [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun). In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed.\n\n=== Acceleration ===\nSince there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to <math> \\mathbf{v}_0 \\cos\\theta </math>. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to <var>g</var>.<ref>The <var>g</var> is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]]. (<math> 9.81 m/s^2 </math> near the surface of the Earth).</ref> The components of the acceleration are:\n\n:<math> a_x = 0 </math>,\n:<math> a_y = g </math>.\n\n=== Velocity ===\nThe horizontal component of the [[velocity]] of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly,<ref>decreasing when the object goes upward, and increasing when it goes downward</ref> because the acceleration due to gravity is constant.

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter ''Y'' for \"year\", the number 2 and a capitalized version of ''k'' for the SI unit prefix [[kilo-|kilo]] meaning 1000; hence, ''2K'' signifies 2000.

Since programs could simply prefix \"19\" to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the date format was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comlinks.com/mag/accr.htm |title=Accrued Savings of the Year 2000 Computer Date Problem |last=Kappelman |first=Leon |last2=Scott |first2=Phil |date=25 November 1996 |website=Computerworld}}</ref>\n\nSome programs, when facing two digit years, could not distinguish between 2000 and 1900.

I used to write those programs back in the 1960s and 1970s, and was proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements of space out of my program by not having to put a 19 before the year. Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented. If I were to go back and look at some of the programs I wrote 30 years ago, I would have one terribly difficult time working my way through step-by-step.\"|\u2014[[Alan Greenspan]], 1998<ref>Testimony by [[Alan Greenspan]], ex-Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] before the [[Senate Banking Committee]], 25 February 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-16-057997-4}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, well before the computer era, business data processing was done using [[unit record equipment]] and [[punched card]]s, most commonly the 80-column variety employed by IBM, which dominated the industry. Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] had reportedly spent over $20 million, including \"a team of 100\" programmers on Y2K.<ref name=\"Globe.Y2K\">{{Cite news |last=Andrew-Gee |first=Eric |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |editor-last=Braden |editor-first=Robert |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]] of 1998 some companies set their mainframe computer dates to 2001, so that \"the wrong date will be perceived as good fun instead of bad computing\" while having a full day of testing.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |date=15 November 1997 |title=Helpful Year 2000 hint |author=D.

Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010.

During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

In both countries, the birth year was historically indicated by two digits only. This numbering system had already given rise to a similar problem, the \"[[Year 1900 problem]]\", which arose due to problems distinguishing between people born in the 20th and 19th centuries. Y2K fears drew attention to an older issue, while prompting a solution to a new problem. In Finland, the problem was solved by replacing the hyphen (\"-\") in the number with the letter \"A\" for people born in the 21st century (for people born before 1900, the sign was already \"+\"). In Norway, the range of the individual numbers following the birth date was altered from 0\u2013499 to 500\u2013999.\n\n===Romania===\nRomania also changed its national identification number in response to the Y2K problem, due to the birth year being represented by only two digits.

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem.

Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented.

Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] had reportedly spent over $20 million, including \"a team of 100\" programmers on Y2K.<ref name=\"Globe.Y2K\">{{Cite news |last=Andrew-Gee |first=Eric |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |editor-last=Braden |editor-first=Robert |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]] of 1998 some companies set their mainframe computer dates to 2001, so that \"the wrong date will be perceived as good fun instead of bad computing\" while having a full day of testing.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |date=15 November 1997 |title=Helpful Year 2000 hint |author=D. Kolstedt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile using 3 digit years and 3 digit dates within that year was used by some, others chose to use the number of days since a fixed date, such as 1 January 1900.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |quote=extends .. the 23rd century |title=Thinking Ahead  |date=28 October 1996  |page=8}}</ref> Inaction was not an option, and risked major failure. Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] is the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changes the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year \"2010\" to \"2016\".<ref name=\"wm6\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm |title=Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016 |date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"cellphone2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061135/http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/ |title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K \u2013 an update |date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).<ref name=\"PS3-1\">{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network-5482365|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network|website=Gizmodo}}</ref>\n\nThe most important occurrences of such a glitch were in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips failed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables |title=2010 Bug in Germany |date=5 January 2010 |publisher=RTL |language=French |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Year 2038 problem====\n{{main|Year 2038 problem}}\n\nThe original [[Unix time]] datatype (<code>[[time_t]]</code>) stores a date and time as a signed long integer (on 32-bit systems a 32-bit integer) representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

In both countries, the birth year was historically indicated by two digits only. This numbering system had already given rise to a similar problem, the \"[[Year 1900 problem]]\", which arose due to problems distinguishing between people born in the 20th and 19th centuries. Y2K fears drew attention to an older issue, while prompting a solution to a new problem. In Finland, the problem was solved by replacing the hyphen (\"-\") in the number with the letter \"A\" for people born in the 21st century (for people born before 1900, the sign was already \"+\"). In Norway, the range of the individual numbers following the birth date was altered from 0\u2013499 to 500\u2013999.\n\n===Romania===\nRomania also changed its national identification number in response to the Y2K problem, due to the birth year being represented by only two digits. Before 2000, the first digit, which shows the person's gender, was 1 for males and 2 for females. Starting from 1 January 2000, the Romanian national identification number starts with 5 for males and 6 for females.\n\n===Uganda===\nThe [[Ugandan government]] responded to the Y2K threat by setting up a Y2K Task Force.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://parsifal.membrane.com/y2k/y2kugand.htm |title=Uganda National Y2k Task Force End-June 1999 Public Position Statement |date=30 June 1999 |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> In August 1999 an independent international assessment by the World Bank International Y2k Cooperation Centre found that Uganda's website was in the top category as \"highly informative\".

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

One of the last acts of the Benfleet Parish Council was to purchase 30 acres of The Downs in 1929, with a view to it becoming a public open space. \n\nOn 14th July 1934 \u00a0Sir Edgar Bonham Carter, K.C.M.G., Vice Chairman of the Open Spaces Preservation Society officially opened the Downs making it an official public space. At the official opening of the Downs a hope was expressed in the programme by Walter Bingham:\n[[File:Opening of Hadleigh Castle Country Park in 1987 - geograph.org.uk - 1535748.jpg|thumb|261x261px|Dennis Nisbet at the opening ceremony]]\n''\u2018To \u00a0have lost to posterity this beautiful place would have been a tragedy indeed its closing or otherwise would have extinguished the eyes of Benfleet. \u00a0A pious hope has often been expressed that at some time in the future, the authorities concerned may get possession of the whole of the slopes from Benfleet to Leigh and thus preserve for ever to the people a vista unrivalled anywhere in Europe...'.''\n\n\nOver time the area in public ownership increased and the park was a long time in gestating. Much of the drive for its establishment came from Councillor Dennis Nisbet, seen in this image at the opening ceremony.

One of the last acts of the Benfleet Parish Council was to purchase 30 acres of The Downs in 1929, with a view to it becoming a public open space. \n\nOn 14th July 1934 \u00a0Sir Edgar Bonham Carter, K.C.M.G., Vice Chairman of the Open Spaces Preservation Society officially opened the Downs making it an official public space. At the official opening of the Downs a hope was expressed in the programme by Walter Bingham:\n\n\u2018To \u00a0have lost to posterity this beautiful place would have been a tragedy indeed its closing or otherwise would have extinguished the eyes of Benfleet. \u00a0A pious hope has often been expressed that at some time in the future, the authorities concerned may get possession of the whole of the slopes from Benfleet to Leigh and thus preserve for ever to the people a vista unrivalled anywhere in Europe...'.\n\nOver time the area in public ownership increased and the park was a long time in gestating. Much of the drive for its establishment came from Councillor Dennis Nisbet, at the opening ceremony.
