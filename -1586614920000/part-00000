This condenses a large part of the gas condensate hydrocarbons. The feedstock mixture of gas, liquid condensate and water is then routed to a high pressure separator vessel where the water and the raw natural gas are separated and removed. If a pressure boost is required, the raw natural gas from the high pressure separator is sent to the main [[gas compressor]], which raises the pressure of the gases to whatever pressure is required for the [[pipeline transport]]ation of the gas to the raw [[natural gas processing]] plant. The main gas compressor discharge pressure will depend upon the operating pressure of and the distance to the raw natural gas processing plant and may require a multi-stage compressor.\n\nThe gas condensate from the high pressure separator flows through a throttling [[control valve]] to a low pressure separator.  The reduction in pressure across the control valve causes the condensate to undergo a partial vaporization referred to as [[flash evaporation|flash vaporization]]. The raw natural gas from the low pressure separator is sent to a \"booster\" compressor that raises the gas pressure and sends it through a cooler, and then to the main gas compressor.\n\nAt the raw natural gas processing plant, the gas will be [[Desiccation|dehydrated]] and [[acid gas]]es and other impurities will be removed from the gas. Then, the [[ethane]] ({{chem|C|2}}), [[propane]] ({{chem|C|3}}), [[butanes]] ({{chem|C|4}}), and [[pentanes]] ({{chem|C|5}})\u2014plus higher [[molecular weight]] hydrocarbons referred to as C<sub>5+</sub>\u2014will also be removed and recovered as byproducts.\n\nThe water removed from both the high and low pressure separators may need to be processed to remove hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) before the water can be disposed of underground or reused in some fashion.\n\nSome of the raw natural gas may be re-injected into the producing formation to help maintain the reservoir pressure, or for storage pending later installation of a pipeline.\n\n==Dangers==\nLike all fossil fuels, condensate contains toxicants which are harmful to the [[Global warming|environment]], animals and humans. It is generally more flammable and explosive than normal crude oil. Operating in areas where condensate has escaped is dangerous for crew due to the danger of explosions, oxygen displacement and the threat of asphyxiating and anaesthetizing, which can occur within a few human breaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-shipping-accident-oil-condensat/factbox-condensate-a-convenient-yet-explosive-fossil-fuel-idUSKBN1EX0N8|title=Factbox: Condensate - a convenient yet explosive fossil fuel\n|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2020-01-11|}}</ref>\n\n==Drip gas==\n'''Drip gas''', so named because it can be drawn off the bottom of small chambers (called ''drips'') sometimes installed in pipelines from gas wells, is another name for natural-gas condensate, a naturally occurring form of [[gasoline]] obtained as a byproduct of natural gas extraction.

In particular, condensate is frequently mixed with [[bitumen]] from [[oil sands]] to create [[dilbit]].  The increased use of condensate as diluent has significantly increased its price in certain regions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Jeff|title=Diluent shortages could make for sticky situation for Alberta bitumen|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/05/23/diluent-shortages-could-make-for-sticky-situation-for-alberta-bitumen/?__lsa=2b55-1dae|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Historical use in vehicles==\n\nSome early [[internal combustion engine]]s\u2014such as the first types made by [[Karl Benz]], and early [[Wright brothers]] aircraft engines\u2014used [[natural gasoline]], which could be either drip gas or a similar range of hydrocarbons distilled from crude oil. Natural gasoline has an [[octane rating]] of about 30 to 50, sufficient for the low-compression engines of the early 20th century.  By 1930, improved engines and higher compression ratios required higher-octane, refined gasolines to produce power without [[Engine knocking|knocking]] or detonation.\n\nBeginning in the [[Great Depression]], drip gas was used as a replacement for commercial gasoline by people in oil-producing areas. \"In the days of simple engines in automobiles and farm tractors it was not uncommon for anyone having access to a condensate well to fill his tank with 'drip,'\" according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. Sometimes it worked fine. \"At other times it might cause thundering backfires and clouds of foul-smelling smoke.\"<ref>Oklahoma Historical Society, [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA017.html Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064720/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA017.html |date=2011-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nCertain manufacturers made farm tractors specifically designed to run on heavy, low-octane fuels which were commonly called \"distillate\" or \"tractor fuel\". Other names were [[tractor vaporising oil]] (United Kingdom) and \"power kerosene\" (Australia). Often the tractors were referred to as \"all-fuel\". The most important factor in burning heavy fuels in a spark-ignition engine is proper fuel vaporization. Tractors designed to run on those fuels usually used a \"hot\" intake air manifold that allowed exhaust heat to warm the manifold and carburetor to aid vaporization. Given the poor vaporization at low temperatures, all-fuel tractors were started on gasoline, then switched to the heavy fuel. They were equipped with a small gasoline tank and a large fuel tank, both of which fed into a common valve supplying the fuel to the carburetor. \n\nThe engine would be started on gasoline and the tractor would then be worked until the engine was sufficiently warm to change over.  At that point, the fuel valve would be turned to switch the fuel supply from the gasoline tank to the fuel tank and the heavy fuel would flow to the carburetor. Shutters or curtains were typically used to restrict airflow to the radiator, keeping the engine sufficiently hot for efficient operation. Coolant temperatures in the 200 degree F range were normal. [[John Deere]] two-cylinder all-fuel tractors worked well on heavy fuel, as their long piston strokes, slow engine speeds and low compression ratios allowed for effective use of the fuel. Most were also equipped with [[thermosiphon]] cooling systems that used no water pumps. Natural convection allowed the water to flow up and out of the engine block and into the top of the radiator, where it cooled and dropped and fell to continue the cycle. \n\n[[Woody Guthrie]]'s autobiographical novel ''Seeds of Man'' begins with Woody and his uncle Jeff tapping a natural gas pipeline for drip gas. The gas also has a mention in ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]],'' the Terrence Malick movie.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050501165201/http://sfy.ru/?script=badlands].</ref>\n\nIt was sold commercially at gas stations and hardware stores in North America until the early 1950s. The [[white gas]] sold today is a similar product but is produced at refineries with the benzene removed.<ref>[http://fuel.papo-art.com/ International Fuel Names]</ref>\n \nIn 1975, the New Mexico State Police's drip gas detail &ndash; three men in pickup trucks &ndash; began patrolling oil and gas fields, catching thieves and recovering barrels of stolen gas. The detail stopped its work in 1987.<ref name=\"nmpolice\"/>\n\nThe use of drip gas in cars and trucks is now illegal in many states. It is also harmful to modern engines due to its low octane rating, much higher combustion temperature than that of gasoline, and lack of additives. It has a distinctive smell when used as a fuel, which allowed police to catch people using drip gas illegally.<ref>[http://www.hurherald.com/cgi-bin/db_scripts/articles?Action=user_view&db=hurheral_articles&id=11798 \"Drip Gas Was A Real Gas for Me As A Kid\"] by Jack Cawthon, June 9, 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.horntown.com/Remember/DripGas.htm Burning Drip Gas] in Horntown, Oklahoma, by Clayton Adair.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Energy}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110101053431/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp Processing raw natural gas]\n* [http://www.petrostrategies.org/Learning%20Center/Gas_Processing.htm Preparing raw natural gas for sales]\n* [http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch05/final/c05s03.pdf Natural Gas Processing] (part of the [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|US EPA's AP-42 publication]] and includes a schematic diagram)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Natural Gas Condensate}}\n[[Category:Natural gas]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids}}\n{{see also|Natural-gas processing#Contaminants in raw natural gas}}\n\n'''Natural-gas condensate''', also called '''natural gas liquids''', is a low-density mixture of [[hydrocarbon]] liquids that are present as gaseous components in the raw [[natural gas]] produced from many natural [[natural gas field|gas fields]].

The increased use of condensate as diluent has significantly increased its price in certain regions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Jeff|title=Diluent shortages could make for sticky situation for Alberta bitumen|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/05/23/diluent-shortages-could-make-for-sticky-situation-for-alberta-bitumen/?__lsa=2b55-1dae|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Historical use in vehicles==\n\nSome early [[internal combustion engine]]s\u2014such as the first types made by [[Karl Benz]], and early [[Wright brothers]] aircraft engines\u2014used [[natural gasoline]], which could be either drip gas or a similar range of hydrocarbons distilled from crude oil. Natural gasoline has an [[octane rating]] of about 30 to 50, sufficient for the low-compression engines of the early 20th century.  By 1930, improved engines and higher compression ratios required higher-octane, refined gasolines to produce power without [[Engine knocking|knocking]] or detonation.\n\nBeginning in the [[Great Depression]], drip gas was used as a replacement for commercial gasoline by people in oil-producing areas. \"In the days of simple engines in automobiles and farm tractors it was not uncommon for anyone having access to a condensate well to fill his tank with 'drip,'\" according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. Sometimes it worked fine. \"At other times it might cause thundering backfires and clouds of foul-smelling smoke.\"<ref>Oklahoma Historical Society, [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA017.html Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064720/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA017.html |date=2011-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nCertain manufacturers made farm tractors specifically designed to run on heavy, low-octane fuels which were commonly called \"distillate\" or \"tractor fuel\". Other names were [[tractor vaporising oil]] (United Kingdom) and \"power kerosene\" (Australia). Often the tractors were referred to as \"all-fuel\". The most important factor in burning heavy fuels in a spark-ignition engine is proper fuel vaporization. Tractors designed to run on those fuels usually used a \"hot\" intake air manifold that allowed exhaust heat to warm the manifold and carburetor to aid vaporization. Given the poor vaporization at low temperatures, all-fuel tractors were started on gasoline, then switched to the heavy fuel. They were equipped with a small gasoline tank and a large fuel tank, both of which fed into a common valve supplying the fuel to the carburetor. \n\nThe engine would be started on gasoline and the tractor would then be worked until the engine was sufficiently warm to change over.  At that point, the fuel valve would be turned to switch the fuel supply from the gasoline tank to the fuel tank and the heavy fuel would flow to the carburetor. Shutters or curtains were typically used to restrict airflow to the radiator, keeping the engine sufficiently hot for efficient operation. Coolant temperatures in the 200 degree F range were normal. [[John Deere]] two-cylinder all-fuel tractors worked well on heavy fuel, as their long piston strokes, slow engine speeds and low compression ratios allowed for effective use of the fuel. Most were also equipped with [[thermosiphon]] cooling systems that used no water pumps. Natural convection allowed the water to flow up and out of the engine block and into the top of the radiator, where it cooled and dropped and fell to continue the cycle. \n\n[[Woody Guthrie]]'s autobiographical novel ''Seeds of Man'' begins with Woody and his uncle Jeff tapping a natural gas pipeline for drip gas. The gas also has a mention in ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]],'' the Terrence Malick movie.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050501165201/http://sfy.ru/?script=badlands].</ref>\n\nIt was sold commercially at gas stations and hardware stores in North America until the early 1950s. The [[white gas]] sold today is a similar product but is produced at refineries with the benzene removed.<ref>[http://fuel.papo-art.com/ International Fuel Names]</ref>\n \nIn 1975, the New Mexico State Police's drip gas detail &ndash; three men in pickup trucks &ndash; began patrolling oil and gas fields, catching thieves and recovering barrels of stolen gas. The detail stopped its work in 1987.<ref name=\"nmpolice\"/>\n\nThe use of drip gas in cars and trucks is now illegal in many states. It is also harmful to modern engines due to its low octane rating, much higher combustion temperature than that of gasoline, and lack of additives. It has a distinctive smell when used as a fuel, which allowed police to catch people using drip gas illegally.<ref>[http://www.hurherald.com/cgi-bin/db_scripts/articles?Action=user_view&db=hurheral_articles&id=11798 \"Drip Gas Was A Real Gas for Me As A Kid\"] by Jack Cawthon, June 9, 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.horntown.com/Remember/DripGas.htm Burning Drip Gas] in Horntown, Oklahoma, by Clayton Adair.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Energy}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110101053431/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp Processing raw natural gas]\n* [http://www.petrostrategies.org/Learning%20Center/Gas_Processing.htm Preparing raw natural gas for sales]\n* [http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch05/final/c05s03.pdf Natural Gas Processing] (part of the [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|US EPA's AP-42 publication]] and includes a schematic diagram)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Natural Gas Condensate}}\n[[Category:Natural gas]]\n", "name_user": "50.26.15.180", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content of use in autos.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-gas_condensate"}
