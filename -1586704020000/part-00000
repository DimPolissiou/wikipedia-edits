A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, e.g. 99<sup>95</sup>. Later, a \"separatrix\" (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] (e.g. 99'''\u02cc'''95), while an L-shaped or [[vertical bar]] ({{!}}) served as the separatrix in England.<ref>{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=separatrix, ''n.'' |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> When this character was [[typeset]], it was convenient to use the existing [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] (99''','''95) or [[full stop]] (99'''.'''95) instead.\n\nPositional [[decimal fraction]]s appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] written in the 10th century.<ref name=Berggren>{{cite book | first=J.

Traditionally, [[English-speaking countries]] employed commas as the delimiter &ndash; 10,000 &ndash; and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or {{val|10000}}. Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],<ref name=\"nist.gov\"/> as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which have also begun advocating the use of a \"[[thin space]]\" in \"groups of three\".<ref name=\"BIPM\"/><ref name=\"old.iupac.org\"/> Within the United States, the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'' also calls for a thin space.<ref name=\"AMA10p793\"/> In some online [[character encoding|encoding]] environments (for example, [[ASCII]]-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.\n\n===Data versus mask===\nDigit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the [[separation of presentation and content]], making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any [[whitespace character]]s into the string of digits in the [[digital content|content]]. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an [[input mask]] or an output mask). Common examples include [[spreadsheet]]s and [[database]]s in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In [[web content]], such digit grouping can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style]]. It is useful because the number can be [[cut, copy, and paste|copied and pasted]] into [[calculator]]s (including a web browser's [[omnibox]]) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, [[Wikipedia]] content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: {{val|149597870700}} metres is 1 [[astronomical unit]]; {{gaps|3.14159|26535|89793|23846}} is [[pi|\u03c0]] rounded to 20 decimal places, and {{gaps|2.71828|18284|59045|23536}} is ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' rounded to 20 decimal places.\n\nIn some [[programming language]]s, it is possible to group the digits in the program's [[source code]] to make it easier to read; see [[Integer literal#Digit separators|Integer literal: Digit separators]]. [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (from version 7.0), [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from GHC version 8.6.1), [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (from version 3.6), [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Julia_(programming_language)|Julia]], and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] use the [[Underscore|underscore (_)]] character for this purpose; as such, these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form [[Fortran]] ignores [[whitespace character|whitespace]] (in all contexts), so 700&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 is permissible. [[C++14]], [[Rebol]], and [[Red_(programming_language)|Red]] allow the use of an [[apostrophe]] for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.\n\n===Exceptions to digit grouping===\nThe [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] states that \"when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit\".<ref name=BIPM/> Likewise, some [[Style guide|manuals of style]] state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1,000 to 9,999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, [[APA style]] stipulates a thousands separator for \"most figures of 1,000 or more\" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.\n\nThere are always \"common-sense\" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, [[postal code]]s and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.\n\n===In non-base-10 numbering systems===\nIn binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a [[nibble]], or equivalently to a [[hexadecimal]] digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits.<ref name=\"DR-DEBUG_H\">As an example, the [[DR-DOS]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] <code>H</code> command displays the entered number in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary notation:<pre>-h 1234\n1234 #4660 \\011064 %0001.0010.0011.0100</pre></ref> Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an [[octal]] digit.

A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, e.g. 99<sup>95</sup>. Later, a \"separatrix\" (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] (e.g. 99'''\u02cc'''95), while an L-shaped or [[vertical bar]] ({{!}}) served as the separatrix in England.<ref>{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=separatrix, ''n.'' |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> When this character was [[typeset]], it was convenient to use the existing [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] (99''','''95) or [[full stop]] (99'''.'''95) instead.\n\nPositional [[decimal fraction]]s appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] written in the 10th century.<ref name=Berggren>{{cite book | first=J.

Traditionally, [[English-speaking countries]] employed commas as the delimiter &ndash; 10,000 &ndash; and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or {{val|10000}}. Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],<ref name=\"nist.gov\"/> as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which have also begun advocating the use of a \"[[thin space]]\" in \"groups of three\".<ref name=\"BIPM\"/><ref name=\"old.iupac.org\"/> Within the United States, the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'' also calls for a thin space.<ref name=\"AMA10p793\"/> In some online [[character encoding|encoding]] environments (for example, [[ASCII]]-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.\n\n===Data versus mask===\nDigit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the [[separation of presentation and content]], making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any [[whitespace character]]s into the string of digits in the [[digital content|content]]. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an [[input mask]] or an output mask). Common examples include [[spreadsheet]]s and [[database]]s in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In [[web content]], such digit grouping can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style]]. It is useful because the number can be [[cut, copy, and paste|copied and pasted]] into [[calculator]]s (including a web browser's [[omnibox]]) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, [[Wikipedia]] content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: {{val|149597870700}} metres is 1 [[astronomical unit]]; {{gaps|3.14159|26535|89793|23846}} is [[pi|\u03c0]] rounded to 20 decimal places, and {{gaps|2.71828|18284|59045|23536}} is ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' rounded to 20 decimal places.\n\nIn some [[programming language]]s, it is possible to group the digits in the program's [[source code]] to make it easier to read; see [[Integer literal#Digit separators|Integer literal: Digit separators]]. [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (from version 7.0), [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from GHC version 8.6.1), [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (from version 3.6), [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Julia_(programming_language)|Julia]], and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] use the [[Underscore|underscore (_)]] character for this purpose; as such, these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form [[Fortran]] ignores [[whitespace character|whitespace]] (in all contexts), so 700&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 is permissible. [[C++14]], [[Rebol]], and [[Red_(programming_language)|Red]] allow the use of an [[apostrophe]] for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.\n\n===Exceptions to digit grouping===\nThe [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] states that \"when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit\".<ref name=BIPM/> Likewise, some [[Style guide|manuals of style]] state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1,000 to 9,999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, [[APA style]] stipulates a thousands separator for \"most figures of 1,000 or more\" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.\n\nThere are always \"common-sense\" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, [[postal code]]s and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.\n\n===In non-base-10 numbering systems===\nIn binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a [[nibble]], or equivalently to a [[hexadecimal]] digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits.<ref name=\"DR-DEBUG_H\">As an example, the [[DR-DOS]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] <code>H</code> command displays the entered number in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary notation:<pre>-h 1234\n1234 #4660 \\011064 %0001.0010.0011.0100</pre></ref> Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an [[octal]] digit.

In each request cycle, the incoming request is mapped to a method on a ''controller'' object, which then generates the outgoing response in its entirety, usually by pulling data out of a ''model'' to populate a ''view'' written in specialized [[web template|template markup]].

Each component is bound to a named element in the XHTML and becomes responsible for rendering that element in the final output. The ''page'' is simply the top-level containing component and is paired with exactly one XHTML template.  Using a special tag, a group of individual components may be abstracted into a single component called a ''panel'', which can then be reused whole in that page, other pages, or even other panels.\n\nEach component is backed by its own model, which represents the state of the component. The framework does not have knowledge of how components interact with their models, which are treated as [[black box|opaque]] objects automatically [[serialization|serialized]] and [[object persistence|persisted]] between requests. More complex models, however, may be made ''detachable'' and provide [[software hook|hooks]] to arrange their own storage and restoration at the beginning and end of each request cycle.  Wicket does not mandate any particular object-persistence or [[object-relational mapping|ORM]] layer, so applications often use some combination of [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] objects{{Citation needed|reason=Hibernate default flush mode is auto-flush, most screens are stateless|date=May 2019}}, [[EJB]]s or [[POJO]]s as models.\n\nIn Wicket, all server side state is automatically managed. You should never directly use an HttpSession object or similar wrapper to store state. Instead, state is associated with components. Each server-side page component holds a nested hierarchy of stateful components, where each component's model is, in the end, a POJO (Plain Old Java Object)\n\nWicket aims for simplicity. There are no configuration files to learn in Wicket.

Wicket is a simple class library with a consistent approach to component structure.\n\n==Example==\nA [[Hello World]] Wicket application, with four files:\n; HelloWorld.html\n: The XHTML template.\n <source lang=\"xml\">\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \n      \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" \n      xmlns:wicket=\"http://wicket.apache.org/dtds.data/wicket-xhtml1.3-strict.dtd\"\n      xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\">\n\n<body>\n    <span wicket:id=\"message\" id=\"message\">Message goes here</span>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n; HelloWorld.java\n: The page component that will be bound to the template.  It, in turn, binds a child component (the Label component named \"message\").\n<source lang=\"java\">\npackage org.wikipedia.wicket;\n\nimport org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage;\nimport org.apache.wicket.markup.html.basic.Label;\n\npublic class HelloWorld extends WebPage {\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     */\n    public HelloWorld() {\n        add(new Label(\"message\", \"Hello World!\"));\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n; HelloWorldApplication.java\n: The main application class, which routes requests for the homepage to the HelloWorld page component.\n<source lang=\"java\">\npackage org.wikipedia.wicket;\n\nimport org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication;\n\npublic class HelloWorldApplication extends WebApplication {\n    /**\n     * Constructor.\n     */\n    public HelloWorldApplication() {\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @see org.apache.wicket.Application#getHomePage()\n     */\n    public Class getHomePage() {\n        return HelloWorld.class;\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n; web.xml\n: The [[Java servlet|servlet]] application [[Deployment Descriptor]], which installs Wicket as the default handler for the servlet and arranges for HelloWorldApplication to be instantiated at startup.\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<web-app xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \n         xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\" \n         xmlns:web=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd\" \n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee \n                             http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd\" \n         id=\"WebApp_ID\" version=\"2.5\">\n    <display-name>Wicket Example</display-name>\n    <filter>\n        <filter-name>HelloWorldApplication</filter-name>\n        <filter-class>org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter</filter-class>\n        <init-param>\n            <param-name>applicationClassName</param-name>\n            <param-value>org.wikipedia.wicket.HelloWorldApplication</param-value>\n        </init-param>\n    </filter>\n    <filter-mapping>\n        <filter-name>HelloWorldApplication</filter-name>\n        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n    </filter-mapping>\n</web-app>\n</source>\n\n==Components==\nBasic components like form, links, repeaters, and so on are built-in.\n\n==Releases==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\nApache Wicket Versions\n!Series\n!Description\n!Latest release\n!Latest release date\n|-\n|{{Version|cp|9.x}}\n|Moving to Java 11 as the required minimum platform, migrated from JUnit 4 to 5, suport for Java 12 and 13, rework page and data storage and other improvements.<ref>[https://wicket.apache.org/news/2019/04/15/wicket-9.0.0-M1-released.html Apache Wicket 9.0.0-M1 released]. wicket.apache.org.

He discovered that in [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models, the [[electroweak symmetry]] can be broken by quantum effects, and he was among the first researchers to develop models based on this idea.<ref name=\"FRS\">{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/graham-ross-12201|title=Graham Ross|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London}} One or more of the preceding sentences may incorporate text from the royalsociety.org website where \"all text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" {{Cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |title=Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies |access-date=2017-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710134855/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies/ |archive-date=2017-07-10 |url-status=bot: unknown }}, \"Intellectual property rights\"</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nRoss was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1991|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1991]].<ref>[https://royalsociety.org/people/graham-ross-12201/ Graham Ross], The Royal Society</ref> In 2012 he was given the [[Dirac Prize#Dirac Medal of the IOP|Dirac Medal]] by the [[Institute of Physics]] ''for his theoretical work in developing both the Standard Model of fundamental particles and forces and theories beyond the Standard Model that have led to many new insights into the origins and nature of the universe''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iop.org/about/awards/gold/dirac/medallists/page_56437.html | title=2012 Dirac medal | publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] | accessdate=28 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{FRS 1991}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ross, Graham}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century physicists]]\n[[Category:21st-century physicists]]\n[[Category:British physicists]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physicists]]\n[[Category:People associated with CERN]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Wadham College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Department of Physics, University of Oxford]]\n", "name_user": "Jpbowen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Ross_(physicist)"}

In [[super robot]] anime, he voiced Ryoma Nagare in ''[[Getter Robo]]'', Akira Hibiki in ''[[Brave Raideen]]'', Sanshir\u014d Tsuwabuki in ''[[Gaiking]]'', Roy Focker in ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', and Sincline in ''[[Beast King GoLion]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nKamiya was born in [[Yokohama]]. He graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan Shiba Commercial High School and became a freelancer after being affiliated with Theatre Echo, [[Aoni Production]], [[Production Baobab]], [[Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society]] and Ups. Kamiya then founded Saeba Shoji, a talent agency.\n\n===Background===\nHis father ran a furniture manufacturing factory, but it suddenly closed and his parents divorced. After that, Kamiya's mother raised him and his brother. As a result of his mother's search for work, he attended many schools over the years, from Aoki Elementary School in Yokohama to Higashidai Elementary School in Tsurumi and Aioi elementary school in Ota-ku, Tokyo. The presence of actor [[Shoichi Ozawa]] as the eldest of Aioi Ko led Kamiya on the road to drama.\n\nAfter that, he entered the Tokyo Metropolitan Tateshiba Commercial High School via Misono Junior High School. Kamiya's friend invited him to join the drama club, saying that, \"I think Kamiya has a good voice.\" At that time, it was more difficult to become an actor than previously and difficult to advance in the field. Kamiya told his mother, \"I want to be an actor. I will do my best because it is the path I chose myself.\" Later, he recalled, \"If [I] were [my] mother, [I] might have stopped crying.\" After graduating from high school, he joined the amateur theater company Kanza in Yokohama.\n\n===Activities as a Voice Actor===\nIn 1970, Kamiya debuted as an anime voice actor playing the role of Senkichi in the TV anime ''[[Mah\u014d no Mako-chan]]'' during the Theatre Echo study period. The first regular role was Sasuke Yashima in ''[[Akakichi no Eleven]]''. He appeared as Koichi Furumi in ''[[Babel II]]'', and also learned his trademark \"scream\" with this work. Since then, he has been in charge of several prominent roles chiefly in robot animation works, such as Ryoma Nagare in ''[[Getter Robo]]''. He was called \"Screaming Kamiya\" because he kept screaming his special moves. One of the notable voice actors in the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' video game series, Kamiya himself appeared on TV commercials when ''Super Robot Wars F'' was released.\n\nIn the 1980s, he appeared in several animated manga series serialised in [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]. He appeared in ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', and ''[[City Hunter]]'', and was also known as one of the voice actors familiar with Jump anime. Since many of these ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'' anime have became long-running series, the works that appeared during this time are often introduced as Akira Kamiya's masterpiece.\n\nHe often narrates commercials and variety shows, including the hero show commercial of [[Tokyo Dome City Attractions]] (former Korakuen Yuenchi), which is primarily broadcast on the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series frame, and has been in charge of narration for over 20 years since 1986.\n\nHe became the recipient of [[Animage]]'s Grand Prix prize.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the program was broadcast on [[TV Asahi]] and was ranked 22nd in \"200 Popular Voice Actors Seriously Selected!

However, he expressed his concern that his schedule was busy, and the performance activities he had enjoyed as an amateur band in a harmonious manner would be produced as professional singer activities, and he offered to withdraw.\n\nHe has worked as a radio personality for [[All Night Nippon]]. He is the first regular personality as a voice actor. In the same program, he made a corner called \"Guinness!\". He knew what he was doing at MBS Young Town, and he still has friends.\n\nIn 1979, he played personality with [[Mitsuko Horie]] on a Sunday afternoon radio program called \"Mitsuko and Akira's Deadly Handgun,\" and released a duet single, \"Oh!

In [[super robot]] anime, he voiced Ryoma Nagare in ''[[Getter Robo]]'', Akira Hibiki in ''[[Brave Raideen]]'', Sanshir\u014d Tsuwabuki in ''[[Gaiking]]'', Roy Focker in ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', and Sincline in ''[[Beast King GoLion]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nKamiya was born in [[Yokohama]]. He graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan Shiba Commercial High School and became a freelancer after being affiliated with Theatre Echo, [[Aoni Production]], [[Production Baobab]], [[Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society]] and Ups. Kamiya then founded Saeba Shoji, a talent agency.\n\n===Background===\nHis father ran a furniture manufacturing factory, but it suddenly closed and his parents divorced. After that, Kamiya's mother raised him and his brother. As a result of his mother's search for work, he attended many schools over the years, from Aoki Elementary School in Yokohama to Higashidai Elementary School in Tsurumi and Aioi elementary school in Ota-ku, Tokyo. The presence of actor [[Shoichi Ozawa]] as the eldest of Aioi Ko led Kamiya on the road to drama.\n\nAfter that, he entered the Tokyo Metropolitan Tateshiba Commercial High School via Misono Junior High School. Kamiya's friend invited him to join the drama club, saying that, \"I think Kamiya has a good voice.\" At that time, it was more difficult to become an actor than previously and difficult to advance in the field. Kamiya told his mother, \"I want to be an actor. I will do my best because it is the path I chose myself.\" Later, he recalled, \"If [I] were [my] mother, [I] might have stopped crying.\" After graduating from high school, he joined the amateur theater company Kanza in Yokohama.\n\n===Activities as a Voice Actor===\nIn 1970, Kamiya debuted as an anime voice actor playing the role of Senkichi in the TV anime ''[[Mah\u014d no Mako-chan]]'' during the Theatre Echo study period. The first regular role was Sasuke Yashima in ''[[Akakichi no Eleven]]''. He appeared as Koichi Furumi in ''[[Babel II]]'', and also learned his trademark \"scream\" with this work. Since then, he has been in charge of several prominent roles chiefly in robot animation works, such as Ryoma Nagare in ''[[Getter Robo]]''. He was called \"Screaming Kamiya\" because he kept screaming his special moves. One of the notable voice actors in the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' video game series, Kamiya himself appeared on TV commercials when ''Super Robot Wars F'' was released.\n\nIn the 1980s, he appeared in several animated manga series serialised in [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]. He appeared in ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', and ''[[City Hunter]]'', and was also known as one of the voice actors familiar with Jump anime. Since many of these ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'' anime have became long-running series, the works that appeared during this time are often introduced as Akira Kamiya's masterpiece.\n\nHe often narrates commercials and variety shows, including the hero show commercial of [[Tokyo Dome City Attractions]] (former Korakuen Yuenchi), which is primarily broadcast on the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series frame, and has been in charge of narration for over 20 years since 1986.\n\nHe became the recipient of [[Animage]]'s Grand Prix prize.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the program was broadcast on [[TV Asahi]] and was ranked 22nd in \"200 Popular Voice Actors Seriously Selected! Voice Actor General Election! 3 Hours SP\".<ref>{{cite news |title=\u58f0\u512a200\u4eba\u304c\u672c\u6c17\u3067\u9078\u3093\u3060\u300c\u58f0\u512a\u7dcf\u9078\u63192017\u300d\u7d50\u679c\u767a\u8868 {{!}} \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30a4\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba |url=https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1483964110 |accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=\u58f0\u512a200\u4eba\u304c\u672c\u6c17\u3067\u9078\u3093\u3060\u300c\u58f0\u512a\u7dcf\u9078\u63192017\u300d\u7d50\u679c\u767a\u8868 {{!}} \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30a4\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba |date=9 January 2017 |language=ja}}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nKamiya was initially a bass player with the popular voice actor's musical group Slapstick, which was active in the 1970s and 1980s. However, he expressed his concern that his schedule was busy, and the performance activities he had enjoyed as an amateur band in a harmonious manner would be produced as professional singer activities, and he offered to withdraw.\n\nHe has worked as a radio personality for [[All Night Nippon]]. He is the first regular personality as a voice actor. In the same program, he made a corner called \"Guinness!\". He knew what he was doing at MBS Young Town, and he still has friends.\n\nIn 1979, he played personality with [[Mitsuko Horie]] on a Sunday afternoon radio program called \"Mitsuko and Akira's Deadly Handgun,\" and released a duet single, \"Oh!

The seal shows the Roman goddess [[Minerva]] ([[Athena]] in [[Greek mythology]]), the goddess of wisdom and war, because she was born an adult, and California was never a territory; a [[California grizzly bear]] (the official state animal) feeding on [[grape]] vines, representing California's [[wine]] production; a sheaf of grain, representing [[agriculture]]; a miner, representing the [[California Gold Rush]] and the [[mining]] industry; and sailing ships, representing the state's economic power. The word ''[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]'' (''\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]), meaning \"I have found it\", is the California [[state motto]].\n\nThe original design of the seal was by U.S. Army major [[Robert S. Garnett]] and engraved by [[Albert Kuner]]. However, because of the friction then in existence between the military and civil authorities, Garnett was unwilling to introduce the design to the constitutional convention, so convention clerk [[Caleb Lyon]] introduced it as his own design, with Garnett's approval. Garnett later became the first general to be killed in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], where he served as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]].\n\n==State Seal basics==\n\n===What is the Great Seal?===\n{{quote|The Great Seal, or the Great Seal of the State of California as it is officially called, is the impression made on \"all commissions, pardons and other public instruments to which the signature of the [[Governor of California|Governor]] is required\" with the attestation of the [[Secretary of State of California|Secretary of State]]; the impression, with or without \"wafer,\" is made by a master die and counter die of an officially adopted design fixed in a seal press capable of exerting great pressure upon the document placed between the two parts of the die; it is also the impression made by the Secretary of State on papers certified over signature.  For the Governor's papers the Great Seal serves the same purpose as a notarial seal on civil documents.  This impression is the Great Seal.  There have been many redesigns and reproductions of this seal \u2013 they are not the Great Seal but only reproductions of it in many forms, sizes and even colors&nbsp;... There has been and is only one Great Seal, there have been many redesigns and reproductions of the seal \u2013 but there is only one Great Seal.  There have been four designs and four master dies [1849, 1883, 1891, and 1937], all basically the same with variations in some minor details and in detail relations.|10px|10px|J. N.

She is introduced as a type of the political birth of the State of California, without having gone through the probation of a Territory. At her feet crouches a grisly [grizzly] bear, feeding upon clusters from a grape vine, which, with the sheaf of wheat, are emblematic of the peculiar characteristics of the country. A miner is engaged at work, with a rocker and bowl at his side, illustrating the golden wealth of the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]], upon whose waters are seen shipping, typical of commercial greatness; and the snow-clad peaks of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] make up the back-ground.

Smith was authorized to prepare a new and correct seal.<ref>\"Great Seal of State Wrong\", ''Los Angeles Times'', March 27, 1928, 4</ref>  This seal was drawn by [[Los Angeles]] heraldic artist Marc J. Rowe who, among other corrections, narrowed the growing break in the mountains so that it appeared to be the Sacramento River, \"fringed by snow-capped Sierra, and not an arm of San Francisco Bay, as the old seal made it appear\".<ref>\"Sacramento River Wends Its Way Across State's Great Seal\", ''Sacramento Bee'', June 7, 1928, 16</ref>  San Franciscans considered this change to be \"a slight on their city in favor of Los Angeles\".<ref>\"San Franciscans Protest Seal as Los Angeles Art\", ''Los Angeles Times'', June 14, 1928, 1</ref>  His design was not adopted as the official seal,<ref name=\"J.N. Bowman 1950\">J. N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California\", ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 167</ref> although it was used by the State Printing Office.  However, just nine years later, the 1937 standardized seal once again featured a widened gap of [[Golden Gate]] proportions, although it did keep Rowe's snow-capped Sierra Nevada that had replaced the barren foothills of previous editions of the seal.  Both features remain to this day.\n\nThe 1937 standardization came about when state employees, wishing to print the seal on blotters for the [[California State Fair|State Fair]], could not find any official design of the seal.  This prompted a new law ([[California Statutes|Statutes of California]], 1937, chapter 380), which \"established for the first time a definite pictured design with which the master die was 'substantially' to conform, and at the same time established the legality of all previous seals which were essentially the same as this one.\"<ref name=\"J.N. Bowman 1950\"/>\n\nThe full color version, accepted as official, was created in 1978 by Jane Van Doren, Graphic Artist for the California State Printing Plant (now the California Office of State Publishing). The whereabouts of the original painting is unknown. \n\n==Misconceptions about elements in (or supposedly in) the Seal==\n\n===The mysterious building===\nAlso in the 1937 standardized seal there is a building on the far left rear hill that has been interpreted in a variety of ways.  The building, along with the break in the mountains, may have been added to give San Francisco Bay a stronger claim on its location being the landscape portrayed in the seal.<ref>J. N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California\", ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 159</ref>  This building first appeared in unofficial versions of the seal as early as 1875,<ref>Robert J. Chandler, ''To Catch Customers: Grafton Tyler Brown's 1875 Lithographic Sample Sheets'' (San Francisco: Richard Seibert, 2014)</ref> and in most of these, the building was clearly meant to represent [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>[[Seal of San Francisco, California|The Seal of the City and County of San Francisco]] features a view of a ship steaming through the Golden Gate, and on each shore stands a structure.

(Eighteen pre-1952 examples that include the building are shown or referred to in this article.)\n# The configuration of the building on this seal is strikingly similar to its appearance in the 1937 standardization, which itself was based on the 1895 ''Blue Book'' rendition.\n# Four detailed, post-1952 accounts of the seal make no mention of the rumor.<ref>\"State Seal a Product of Convicts\", ''San Diego Union'', January 31, 1960, A22</ref><ref>Letters Between J.

The right half, with some imagination, resembles the front gates of San Quentin State Prison, and the left half, with even more imagination, [[Folsom State Prison]]'s Greystone Chapel.  Why the artist portrayed the building in this fashion is another mystery.  If the artist did mean for the building to be San Quentin and Folsom prisons, the rumor being mistakenly attached to the seal in front of the Capitol may have stemmed from a confusion of the two seals, which are only a few blocks from each other.<ref>The rumor may have been given further credence by the 1988 discovery that a printing plate in use by prison labor on behalf of the state printing office gave Minerva's face the appearance of Snoopy, the famous cartoon beagle.  At first it was believed that it was a prank by the inmates but later was found to have been caused unintentionally by a worn printing plate.  (\"That Character on State Seal NOT Snoopy\", ''Modesto Bee'', April 1, 1988, B4).  In a similar vein, Vermont inmates working in the prison print shop made an unsanctioned change to the state police emblem door decal used on the sides of thirty police cruisers.  One of the spots on the cow (which is supposed to be there) was altered to take the shape of a pig.

The seal used is the one on the Resources Building. Whatever the building is, it is easily missed.

ACR 131 renamed part of [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]] in [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]] in honor of multiethnic California pioneer [[William Leidesdorff|William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr]].  It read, in part: \"WHEREAS, In 1847, William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. captained the first and only steamship in California prior to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush of 1848]], the ''Sitka''.  His maiden steam voyage up the Sacramento River is immortalized on the California State Seal and recognizes his vision for increased maritime transportation of California's agricultural products to world markets.\"  A vessel of thirty-seven feet length, nine feet breadth of beam, and eighteen inch draw, for her trial voyage on San Francisco Bay a very large passenger was repeatedly warned not to stir from his \"post of honor immediately over the boiler,\" and on her only voyage to Sacramento in November/December 1847 it was reported that the baby of one of her passengers needed to be passed around to keep the \"crank\" vessel trim.  Her career as a steam vessel was short-lived, however, as she sank at anchorage in February of the next year during a gale in San Francisco.  \"Thus perished the first steamer on the Bay, a mere toy, and a most dangerous one too,\" reported San Francisco's ''[[The Californian (1840s newspaper)|Californian]]'', \"Should she be resuscitated by the owner we sincerely hope that none of our citizens will trust themselves with a passage in her beyond the 'flat' that she now rests upon.\"  The pioneering and enterprising Leidesdorff did indeed have her raised and refitted as a schooner, the ''Rainbow'', and she continued to run on the Sacramento River after the discovery of gold.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846\u20131848'' (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 575\u2013581</ref><ref>\"A Chapter on Steamboats,\" ''Sacramento Union'', May 19, 1858, 1</ref><ref>\"Trouble on the Bay,\" (San Francisco) ''Californian'', February 16, 1848, 2</ref>\n\n[[Image:Seal of California (Steamship Detail), West Entrance of California State Capitol, Sacramento.jpg|thumb|left|An interpretation of the steamship as a screw steamer]]\n\nHowever, in his 2001 book, ''Maritime Tragedies on the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]'', Justin Ruhge suggested another possibility.  The [[USS Edith (1849)|USS ''Edith'']], a [[screw steamer]], was sent from San Francisco Bay to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Diego]] in August 1849 to pick up the delegates for the upcoming constitutional convention.  On the second day out, the ''Edith'' ran aground in a heavy fog at about 10 p.m. south of Point Sal, at the north end of what would become [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]].  There was no loss of life and the captain and crew were later exonerated by a [[Naval Board of Inquiry|Court of Inquiry]], but the ship and her cargo had to be abandoned.  Garnett, a passenger, was left in charge of the salvage efforts.  Sam Pollard reported that \"a few days after the wreck [Garnett] came to [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] and was my guest for two weeks&nbsp;... and showed me the work he was doing on [the State Seal] in my store at San Luis Obispo.\"  Ruhge concluded, \"When Major Garnett laid out the seal, he included a number of sailing ships and on the middle left side of the seal he also drew in a steam [[Barque|bark]].  It is likely that this is the U.S.S. ''Edith''.  The ship in the drawing is a steamer without side wheels.  At that time only the U.S.S. ''Edith'' was such a ship.  The only other steamer on the west coast at that time was the much larger steamer [[SS California (1848)|''California'']] that was driven by side wheels.\"<ref>Justin Ruhge, \"Looking Back at Local History,\" ''Santa Maria Times'', May 21, 2001</ref>  Leidesdorff's ''Sitka'' was a sidewheeler as well.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846\u20131848'' (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 577</ref>\n\n===The number of stars/Conrad Murray trial===\nWhen live television coverage of the [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray trial]] of 2011 went to break, a seal, most likely located in the courthouse where the trial took place, was shown.  It was soon discovered that this seal had thirty-two stars instead of the proper thirty-one. This error was interpreted by some as an intentional clue that the trial was a hoax, [[Michael Jackson]] was still alive, and had faked his own death.<ref>[http://www.michaeljacksonhoaxforum.com/smf2.0/index.php?topic=20657.0 Michael Jackson Death Hoax Investigators]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed March 14, 2012</ref><ref>advice365, [http://mjdeath-hoax-or-not.blogspot.com/2012/02/michael-jackson-death-hoax-is-it-all-in.html Michael Jackson: Death Hoax or Not?], accessed March 14, 2012</ref>  However, even seals found in government buildings are not immune to error: a thirty-eight star seal was on display at the San Diego County courthouse from 1889 until its demolition in 1959\u2014seventy years<ref>[http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=55,1635949&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL \"Stained Glass Windows \u2013 A Tribute to San Diego County Courts of the Past\"], Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, accessed May 17, 2012</ref>\u2014and the seal sculpted into the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the 1928 [[Stanley Mosk]] Library and Courts I building in Sacramento, where the [[Supreme Court of California]] sits while in the capital, shows twenty-one stars.  Within the California State Capitol itself, the seals carved into the secretary's desk on the [[California State Senate|Senate]] floor and the clerk's desk on the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] floor, both in use since 1870, contain only thirteen stars. Twenty-nine star seals are attached to the [[Bernice F. Sisk|B. F. Sisk]] Courthouse in Fresno, the Senator [[Al Alquist|Alfred E. Alquist]] State Building in San Jose, the Justice [[Joseph A. Rattigan]] State Building in Santa Rosa, and the Van Nuys State Office Building in Van Nuys. And so the thirty-two star seal shown during the proceedings cannot be used as evidence that the trial was a hoax.\n\nIn fact, an incorrect number of stars had been a widespread problem for some time. \"Numerous reproductions of the seal are found in well-known books and other widely circulated printed matter which show thirty-two stars instead of thirty-one\", wrote the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1937.<ref>Rockwell D. Hunt, \"State Seal of California\", ''Los Angeles Times'', September 8, 1937, A4</ref>  In 1914, seals were found to have as few as eleven, and as many as thirty-eight, stars.<ref name=\"All Are Wrong 1914\"/>  A version of the seal showing thirty-eight stars appeared on the title page of the 1887, 1889, 1893, 1895 (the 1895 edition also showed a thirty-two star on page 299<ref name=\"California Blue Book 1895\"/>), and 1899 editions of the ''California Blue Book'', a publication of the Office of the Secretary of State (the custodian of the Great Seal).  No seal appeared on the title page of the 1903 or 1907 editions.  Strangely, a thirty-one star seal was used in the 1909 edition, but the publication went back to thirty-eight stars in 1911 and 1915, then settled on thirty-one in 1924.\n\n'''Various numbers of stars on various seals'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal_of_California,_ca._1870,_Desk_of_the_Secretary_of_the_Senate,_Senate_Chamber,_California_State_Capitol,_Sacramento.jpg|Thirteen star seal, Senate Secretary's Desk, California State Capitol, Sacramento\nFile:Seal_of_California,_ca._1928,_detail_from_the_tympanum_of_the_Stanley_Mosk_Library_and_Courts_Building,_Sacramento,_California.jpg|Twenty-one star seal, Stanley Mosk Library and Courts Building, Sacramento\nFile:Seal of California, Hiram Johnson State Building Auditorium, Civic Center, San Francisco, California.jpg|Twenty-six star seal, Hiram Johnson State Building auditorium, San Francisco\nFile:Governor_Arnold_Schwarzenegger's_Official_Portrait_(Governor's_Seal_Detail),_Gottfried_Helnwein.jpg|Twenty-nine star California Governor's Seal, which should have thirty-one, as the state seal does, California State Capitol, Sacramento\nFile:US-NBN-CA-state seal detail (Series 1882BB reverse) proof.jpg|Twenty-nine star seal on the reverse of a Series 1882BB National Bank Note\nFile:Seal_of_California,_Unknown_Date,_B.F._Sisk_Courthouse,_Fresno,_California.jpg|Twenty-nine star seal on the B.F.

The editorial continued that Lyon \"received his money out of the civil fund, and is now conveying it to the sylvan retreats of [[Lyonsdale, New York|Lyonsdale]]\" and quite vehemently stated that Lyon had \"no right or title to the honor of either designing or executing the seal any more than the Kha[n] of Tartary\" while still protecting the anonymity of Garnett.<ref>\"The State Seal,\" ''Daily Alta California'', February 19, 1850, 2</ref>  However, the fact that Garnett was chiefly responsible for the design was known by at least one observer of the convention at the time and generally known no later than December 1849.<ref>Bayard Taylor, \"Bayard Taylor's Letters, No. XXVII,\" ''New York Weekly Tribune'', December 22, 1849, 1</ref>\n\nControversy arose again in 1899 with an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that claimed that Garnett's design was not original, but in fact based upon the seal of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]]' California Lodge No. 1, with a few changes.<ref>\"State Seal Pirated, Say the Odd Fellows,\" ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 5, 1899, 7</ref>  This article was soon followed by a defense of the originality of the design written by Major Garnett's brother, Louis A.

Denver]].  Denver, who had been elected to the [[United States Congress]] (and in whose honor the city of [[Denver, Colorado]], was named), left for [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 5, but his resignation was not effective until November 5.  Bigler asked for an immediate resignation and threatened to declare the office vacant and appoint a new Secretary of State if this request was refused.  In the same letter, he also requested that the Great Seal be kept in the Governor's Office.  Denver refused the request, as it would be impossible for him to fulfill his duties without it, and cited the fact that the seal had always been kept in the possession of the Secretary of State.  On October 6, Bigler appointed his private secretary, C.H. Hempstead, to the office, and, accompanied by two witnesses, went to the office of the Secretary of State to have the appointment certified.  Denver's deputy refused to certify, as he argued that the office would not be vacated until November 5, the effective date of Denver's resignation.  It was not until that date that Hempstead's appointment was finally certified.<ref>Summarized from J.N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California,\" ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 169</ref>\n\nIn 1958, a disagreement arose between Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan and [[State Architect#History|State Architect]] Anson Boyd over the design of the seal being used on state buildings in Sacramento.

The error was first discovered in the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|Department of Corrections]] newsletter, printed by prison labor, and so it was first suspected to be a prank by the inmates.  It was later revealed that the source of the error was a worn printing plate, and so was not intentional.<ref>\"That Character on State Seal NOT Snoopy,\" ''Modesto Bee'', April 1, 1988, B4</ref>\n\nWhile most errors on the seal are unintentional, at least one was done \"on porpoise\": the staff of Assemblyman [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]] once ordered a birthday cake for their boss with a California seal on it, but it was \"the kind that has flippers, swims in the ocean and eats fish.\"<ref>Frank Moore, \"With a Grain of Salt,\" ''Redlands (CA) Daily Facts'', October 23, 1974, B8</ref>\n\n==Examples of the Seal==\n\n===Sacramento===\nThe seal can be seen in its various incarnations near the entrances of a number of state buildings in downtown Sacramento, including the State Capitol (as well as several inside of the Capitol, including an 1854 carving and a 1908 stained glass \"sky\" light), Stanley Mosk Library and Courts I (within the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at 914 [[Capitol Mall]]), Department of Rehabilitation (721 Capitol Mall, not to be confused the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]]), [[California State Personnel Board|State Personnel Board]] (801 Capitol Mall), [[Employment Development Department]] (722/800 Capitol Mall), [[California Natural Resources Agency|Resources Agency]] (1416 Ninth Street), [[California Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (1500 Eleventh Street), [[California Department of Transportation|CalTrans]] (1121 O Street), [[Fire marshal#California Fire Marshal|Office of the State Fire Marshal]] (1131 S Street), and the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles|Department of Motor Vehicles]] (2415 First Avenue).  A hand-painted seal which used to be on display at the old Oakland State Building (1111 Jackson Street) until its closure following the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] of 1989 can today be seen just within the front entrance of the state building at 1304 O Street, Sacramento.  In [[West Sacramento]], on the opposite shore of the [[Sacramento River]] from [[Old Sacramento]], near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[California Department of General Services]] in the distinctive [[The Ziggurat|Ziggurat building]], is another seal. Near the base of the [[James W.

So large that it was shipped via oyster shell [[barge]] from the artists' studio (a dairy barn) in [[Petaluma, CA|Petaluma]], a 1500-pound [[fiberglass]] seal hangs above the entrance to the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] building.<ref>Jacque Giuffre (one of the two artists who created this seal), email to the author, May 29, 2012</ref>  A bright golden [[:File:Seal of California, Hiram Johnson State Building Auditorium, Civic Center, San Francisco, California.jpg|seal]] is on display in the auditorium of the [[Hiram Johnson]] State Building.  There are two more, less spectacularly colored seals at the north and south entrances to that building. Joined by the seals of other western states, the seal of California hangs above one of the elevators in the lobby of the [[Phoebe Hearst|Hearst]] Building at [[Third Street (San Francisco)|Third]] and [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market]] streets. A seal can also be found at Metropolitan Barber Shop, at 1018 Bush Street.\n\nAround the Bay Area, other seals can be found at the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]] Parlor No. 62 in [[Napa, California|Napa]] (a six-foot wide stained glass), the historic [[Sonoma Plaza|plaza]] in [[Sonoma, CA|Sonoma]] on the [[California Republic#Bear Flag Revolt|1846 Bear Flag Revolt]] monument (1914), the [[Elihu M Harris State Office Building]] in [[Oakland]], the [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] History Museum in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]] (a mosaic dating to 1910), the [[Circle of Palms Plaza]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the site of California's first state capitol, and in front of [[Colton Hall]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the site of the 1849 Constitutional Convention.

Also in downtown Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles County Law Library, a large Seal of California is joined by others representing the various court districts of the area.  At the 1934 California State Fair, Los Angeles-based [[Helms Bakery]] won the gold medal for the best loaf of bread, topping 471 other entries.<ref>\"32 Years Serving the Southland,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', March 3, 1963, A35</ref>  Large reproductions of this medal, showing the seal on one side, can be seen on the exterior of all three former locations in [[Culver City]], [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], and [[San Bernardino]].  As part of his 1932 mural on the ceiling of the Fluor Gallery of the [[Bowers Museum]] in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], artist Martin Syvertsen included a seal. Another seal is attached to the Family Law Court in [[Riverside, CA|Riverside]].\n\nAbove the bench in Courtroom #1 of the [[Superior Courts of California|San Diego Superior Court]] hangs a stained glass [[:File:Seal of California, John Mallon, 1889, San Diego Superior Court.jpg|seal]].

To celebrate the 1935\u20131936 [[California Pacific International Exposition]], also held in Balboa Park, the [[United States Mint]] issued a [[California Pacific International Exposition#Commemorative coins and stamps|commemorative half-dollar piece]] featuring a modified seal on the obverse. In 1907, the [[Native Daughters of the Golden West]] presented a large tablet to the officers and crew of the armored cruiser [[USS California (ACR-6)|USS ''California'' (ACR-6)]].

In 1967, soon after Ronald Reagan's inauguration as governor, the ''Sacramento Bee'' ran an editorial cartoon showing an overweight Minerva and bear, representing bloated state government, doing toe-touching exercises as Reagan, dressed as an athletics coach, calls out, \"Squeeze, Cut, Trim \u2013 Squeeze, Cut, Trim.\"<ref>\"Squeeze, Cut, Trim,\" ''Sacramento Bee'', January 15, 1967, B3</ref>  In 2001, the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' printed a letter to the editor with a light-hearted suggestion of new imagery for the seal.

Seal of the State of California''' was adopted at the [[California]] [[U.S. state|state]] [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention of 1849]] and has undergone minor design changes since then, the last being the standardization of the seal in 1937. The seal shows the Roman goddess [[Minerva]] ([[Athena]] in [[Greek mythology]]), the goddess of wisdom and war, because she was born an adult, and California was never a territory; a [[California grizzly bear]] (the official state animal) feeding on [[grape]] vines, representing California's [[wine]] production; a sheaf of grain, representing [[agriculture]]; a miner, representing the [[California Gold Rush]] and the [[mining]] industry; and sailing ships, representing the state's economic power. The word ''[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]'' (''\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]), meaning \"I have found it\", is the California [[state motto]].\n\nThe original design of the seal was by U.S. Army major [[Robert S. Garnett]] and engraved by [[Albert Kuner]]. However, because of the friction then in existence between the military and civil authorities, Garnett was unwilling to introduce the design to the constitutional convention, so convention clerk [[Caleb Lyon]] introduced it as his own design, with Garnett's approval. Garnett later became the first general to be killed in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], where he served as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]].\n\n==State Seal basics==\n\n===What is the Great Seal?===\n{{quote|The Great Seal, or the Great Seal of the State of California as it is officially called, is the impression made on \"all commissions, pardons and other public instruments to which the signature of the [[Governor of California|Governor]] is required\" with the attestation of the [[Secretary of State of California|Secretary of State]]; the impression, with or without \"wafer,\" is made by a master die and counter die of an officially adopted design fixed in a seal press capable of exerting great pressure upon the document placed between the two parts of the die; it is also the impression made by the Secretary of State on papers certified over signature.  For the Governor's papers the Great Seal serves the same purpose as a notarial seal on civil documents.  This impression is the Great Seal.

Garnett, letter to Caleb Lyon, September 30, 1849 (Courtesy of Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries)</ref> and in 1899, Garnett's brother referred to the mountain as [[Mount Diablo]],<ref name=\"Louis A.

Smith was authorized to prepare a new and correct seal.<ref>\"Great Seal of State Wrong\", ''Los Angeles Times'', March 27, 1928, 4</ref>  This seal was drawn by [[Los Angeles]] heraldic artist Marc J. Rowe who, among other corrections, narrowed the growing break in the mountains so that it appeared to be the Sacramento River, \"fringed by snow-capped Sierra, and not an arm of San Francisco Bay, as the old seal made it appear\".<ref>\"Sacramento River Wends Its Way Across State's Great Seal\", ''Sacramento Bee'', June 7, 1928, 16</ref>  San Franciscans considered this change to be \"a slight on their city in favor of Los Angeles\".<ref>\"San Franciscans Protest Seal as Los Angeles Art\", ''Los Angeles Times'', June 14, 1928, 1</ref>  His design was not adopted as the official seal,<ref name=\"J.N. Bowman 1950\">J. N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California\", ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 167</ref> although it was used by the State Printing Office.  However, just nine years later, the 1937 standardized seal once again featured a widened gap of [[Golden Gate]] proportions, although it did keep Rowe's snow-capped Sierra Nevada that had replaced the barren foothills of previous editions of the seal.  Both features remain to this day.\n\nThe 1937 standardization came about when state employees, wishing to print the seal on blotters for the [[California State Fair|State Fair]], could not find any official design of the seal.  This prompted a new law ([[California Statutes|Statutes of California]], 1937, chapter 380), which \"established for the first time a definite pictured design with which the master die was 'substantially' to conform, and at the same time established the legality of all previous seals which were essentially the same as this one.\"<ref name=\"J.N.

The building, along with the break in the mountains, may have been added to give San Francisco Bay a stronger claim on its location being the landscape portrayed in the seal.<ref>J. N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California\", ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 159</ref>  This building first appeared in unofficial versions of the seal as early as 1875,<ref>Robert J.

The rumor states it was added as a \"signature\" of the prison inmates who cast it, as their alleged request to add their actual signatures was supposedly refused. The unsanctioned addition, so the story goes, was not noticed until it was too late to do anything about it, and so was left as is. Although this 3,400 pound, nearly ten foot wide seal was created in the foundry at San Quentin,<ref>''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1958), 667</ref> five facts stand in the way of this rumor's being true:\n\n# If the building is taken as San Quentin and if the break in the mountains is taken to be the Golden Gate, then the view must be of the San Francisco Bay Area, looking from east to west.  That places the building on the wrong side of the Gate to be San Quentin.\n# No building in this form, including the chapel, has ever existed at San Quentin.\n# The building first appeared in artistic renditions of the seal as early as 1875, decades before this seal was cast in 1952, and was officially added in 1937.  (Eighteen pre-1952 examples that include the building are shown or referred to in this article.)\n# The configuration of the building on this seal is strikingly similar to its appearance in the 1937 standardization, which itself was based on the 1895 ''Blue Book'' rendition.\n# Four detailed, post-1952 accounts of the seal make no mention of the rumor.<ref>\"State Seal a Product of Convicts\", ''San Diego Union'', January 31, 1960, A22</ref><ref>Letters Between J.

But be careful with what you read: this article goes on to mention \u2013 twice \u2013 that the seal contains thirty-six stars to represent California being the thirty-sixth state.  It was, in fact, the thirty-first</ref>  This seal features what appears to be two structures combined into one.  The right half, with some imagination, resembles the front gates of San Quentin State Prison, and the left half, with even more imagination, [[Folsom State Prison]]'s Greystone Chapel.  Why the artist portrayed the building in this fashion is another mystery.  If the artist did mean for the building to be San Quentin and Folsom prisons, the rumor being mistakenly attached to the seal in front of the Capitol may have stemmed from a confusion of the two seals, which are only a few blocks from each other.<ref>The rumor may have been given further credence by the 1988 discovery that a printing plate in use by prison labor on behalf of the state printing office gave Minerva's face the appearance of Snoopy, the famous cartoon beagle.  At first it was believed that it was a prank by the inmates but later was found to have been caused unintentionally by a worn printing plate.  (\"That Character on State Seal NOT Snoopy\", ''Modesto Bee'', April 1, 1988, B4).  In a similar vein, Vermont inmates working in the prison print shop made an unsanctioned change to the state police emblem door decal used on the sides of thirty police cruisers.  One of the spots on the cow (which is supposed to be there) was altered to take the shape of a pig.  (Zach Howard, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/03/us-police-decal-vermont-idUSTRE81201Q20120203 \"Vermont Inmates Hide Pig in Official Police Car Decal\"], Reuters, February 2, 2012, accessed November 8, 2012)</ref>  In fact, a postcard dated 2000 shows an image of the State Capitol at night, with an inset image of the seal. The seal used is the one on the Resources Building. Whatever the building is, it is easily missed.  Even the nearly exhaustive official color scheme for the seal (e.g., \"the spear of Minerva shall be Oakwood, [[Standard Color Reference of America|Cable No.]] 70094 and the tip white\"), passed in 1967\u2014thirty years after the structure was officially added\u2014failed to mention the building.<ref>''Statutes of California'', 1967, chapter 919</ref>\n\n'''Other interpretations of the mysterious building over the years'''<br/>\nBecause there is no official designation of the identity of the building, artists have interpreted the building in a number of ways.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1910, San Mateo County History Museum, Redwood City, California.jpg|[[San Mateo County History Museum]], Redwood City (1910)\nFile:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1925, Veteran's Welfare Bond.jpg|Veteran's Welfare Bond (1925): Here the building looks somewhat like the old [[Benicia Capitol State Historic Park|State Capitol]] in [[Benicia, California|Benicia]].\nFile:Seal_of_California_(Building_Detail),_1915,_San_Diego_Museum_of_Art,_Balboa_Park,_San_Diego.jpg|Above the entrance to the [[San Diego Museum of Art]] in [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], this 1926 seal places the building behind Minerva.\nFile:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1928 (Artistic Rendition), Room 500, Library and Courts I, Sacramento, California.jpg|Room 500, Library and Courts I, Sacramento (c. 1928)\nFile:Seal of California (Building Detail), 1928, Marc Rowe.jpg|Marc J.

The source of this story is most likely a confusion of the state seal (with its supposed chapel) with the [[Seal of Los Angeles County, California|Seal of Los Angeles County]] (and its crossless view of [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]]).

No primary source documents have confirmed either of the following intriguing claims.\n\n[[Image:Seal of California (Steamship Detail), 1998, Elihu Harris State Office Building, Oakland, California.jpg|thumb|left|An interpretation of the steamship as a sidewheeler]]\n\nIn 2004, the [[California State Legislature]] passed [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/asm/ab_0101-0150/acr_131_bill_20040503_chaptered.html Assembly Concurrent Resolution 131], authored by [[Dave Cox]].  ACR 131 renamed part of [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]] in [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]] in honor of multiethnic California pioneer [[William Leidesdorff|William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr]].  It read, in part: \"WHEREAS, In 1847, William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. captained the first and only steamship in California prior to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush of 1848]], the ''Sitka''.  His maiden steam voyage up the Sacramento River is immortalized on the California State Seal and recognizes his vision for increased maritime transportation of California's agricultural products to world markets.\"  A vessel of thirty-seven feet length, nine feet breadth of beam, and eighteen inch draw, for her trial voyage on San Francisco Bay a very large passenger was repeatedly warned not to stir from his \"post of honor immediately over the boiler,\" and on her only voyage to Sacramento in November/December 1847 it was reported that the baby of one of her passengers needed to be passed around to keep the \"crank\" vessel trim.  Her career as a steam vessel was short-lived, however, as she sank at anchorage in February of the next year during a gale in San Francisco.  \"Thus perished the first steamer on the Bay, a mere toy, and a most dangerous one too,\" reported San Francisco's ''[[The Californian (1840s newspaper)|Californian]]'', \"Should she be resuscitated by the owner we sincerely hope that none of our citizens will trust themselves with a passage in her beyond the 'flat' that she now rests upon.\"  The pioneering and enterprising Leidesdorff did indeed have her raised and refitted as a schooner, the ''Rainbow'', and she continued to run on the Sacramento River after the discovery of gold.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846\u20131848'' (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 575\u2013581</ref><ref>\"A Chapter on Steamboats,\" ''Sacramento Union'', May 19, 1858, 1</ref><ref>\"Trouble on the Bay,\" (San Francisco) ''Californian'', February 16, 1848, 2</ref>\n\n[[Image:Seal of California (Steamship Detail), West Entrance of California State Capitol, Sacramento.jpg|thumb|left|An interpretation of the steamship as a screw steamer]]\n\nHowever, in his 2001 book, ''Maritime Tragedies on the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]'', Justin Ruhge suggested another possibility.  The [[USS Edith (1849)|USS ''Edith'']], a [[screw steamer]], was sent from San Francisco Bay to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Diego]] in August 1849 to pick up the delegates for the upcoming constitutional convention.  On the second day out, the ''Edith'' ran aground in a heavy fog at about 10 p.m. south of Point Sal, at the north end of what would become [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]].  There was no loss of life and the captain and crew were later exonerated by a [[Naval Board of Inquiry|Court of Inquiry]], but the ship and her cargo had to be abandoned.  Garnett, a passenger, was left in charge of the salvage efforts.  Sam Pollard reported that \"a few days after the wreck [Garnett] came to [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] and was my guest for two weeks&nbsp;... and showed me the work he was doing on [the State Seal] in my store at San Luis Obispo.\"  Ruhge concluded, \"When Major Garnett laid out the seal, he included a number of sailing ships and on the middle left side of the seal he also drew in a steam [[Barque|bark]].  It is likely that this is the U.S.S. ''Edith''.  The ship in the drawing is a steamer without side wheels.  At that time only the U.S.S. ''Edith'' was such a ship.  The only other steamer on the west coast at that time was the much larger steamer [[SS California (1848)|''California'']] that was driven by side wheels.\"<ref>Justin Ruhge, \"Looking Back at Local History,\" ''Santa Maria Times'', May 21, 2001</ref>  Leidesdorff's ''Sitka'' was a sidewheeler as well.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXII, History of California, Volume V, 1846\u20131848'' (San Francisco: The History Company, 1886), 577</ref>\n\n===The number of stars/Conrad Murray trial===\nWhen live television coverage of the [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray trial]] of 2011 went to break, a seal, most likely located in the courthouse where the trial took place, was shown.  It was soon discovered that this seal had thirty-two stars instead of the proper thirty-one. This error was interpreted by some as an intentional clue that the trial was a hoax, [[Michael Jackson]] was still alive, and had faked his own death.<ref>[http://www.michaeljacksonhoaxforum.com/smf2.0/index.php?topic=20657.0 Michael Jackson Death Hoax Investigators]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed March 14, 2012</ref><ref>advice365, [http://mjdeath-hoax-or-not.blogspot.com/2012/02/michael-jackson-death-hoax-is-it-all-in.html Michael Jackson: Death Hoax or Not?], accessed March 14, 2012</ref>  However, even seals found in government buildings are not immune to error: a thirty-eight star seal was on display at the San Diego County courthouse from 1889 until its demolition in 1959\u2014seventy years<ref>[http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=55,1635949&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL \"Stained Glass Windows \u2013 A Tribute to San Diego County Courts of the Past\"], Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, accessed May 17, 2012</ref>\u2014and the seal sculpted into the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the 1928 [[Stanley Mosk]] Library and Courts I building in Sacramento, where the [[Supreme Court of California]] sits while in the capital, shows twenty-one stars.  Within the California State Capitol itself, the seals carved into the secretary's desk on the [[California State Senate|Senate]] floor and the clerk's desk on the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] floor, both in use since 1870, contain only thirteen stars. Twenty-nine star seals are attached to the [[Bernice F. Sisk|B. F. Sisk]] Courthouse in Fresno, the Senator [[Al Alquist|Alfred E. Alquist]] State Building in San Jose, the Justice [[Joseph A. Rattigan]] State Building in Santa Rosa, and the Van Nuys State Office Building in Van Nuys. And so the thirty-two star seal shown during the proceedings cannot be used as evidence that the trial was a hoax.\n\nIn fact, an incorrect number of stars had been a widespread problem for some time. \"Numerous reproductions of the seal are found in well-known books and other widely circulated printed matter which show thirty-two stars instead of thirty-one\", wrote the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1937.<ref>Rockwell D. Hunt, \"State Seal of California\", ''Los Angeles Times'', September 8, 1937, A4</ref>  In 1914, seals were found to have as few as eleven, and as many as thirty-eight, stars.<ref name=\"All Are Wrong 1914\"/>  A version of the seal showing thirty-eight stars appeared on the title page of the 1887, 1889, 1893, 1895 (the 1895 edition also showed a thirty-two star on page 299<ref name=\"California Blue Book 1895\"/>), and 1899 editions of the ''California Blue Book'', a publication of the Office of the Secretary of State (the custodian of the Great Seal).  No seal appeared on the title page of the 1903 or 1907 editions.  Strangely, a thirty-one star seal was used in the 1909 edition, but the publication went back to thirty-eight stars in 1911 and 1915, then settled on thirty-one in 1924.\n\n'''Various numbers of stars on various seals'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal_of_California,_ca._1870,_Desk_of_the_Secretary_of_the_Senate,_Senate_Chamber,_California_State_Capitol,_Sacramento.jpg|Thirteen star seal, Senate Secretary's Desk, California State Capitol, Sacramento\nFile:Seal_of_California,_ca._1928,_detail_from_the_tympanum_of_the_Stanley_Mosk_Library_and_Courts_Building,_Sacramento,_California.jpg|Twenty-one star seal, Stanley Mosk Library and Courts Building, Sacramento\nFile:Seal of California, Hiram Johnson State Building Auditorium, Civic Center, San Francisco, California.jpg|Twenty-six star seal, Hiram Johnson State Building auditorium, San Francisco\nFile:Governor_Arnold_Schwarzenegger's_Official_Portrait_(Governor's_Seal_Detail),_Gottfried_Helnwein.jpg|Twenty-nine star California Governor's Seal, which should have thirty-one, as the state seal does, California State Capitol, Sacramento\nFile:US-NBN-CA-state seal detail (Series 1882BB reverse) proof.jpg|Twenty-nine star seal on the reverse of a Series 1882BB National Bank Note\nFile:Seal_of_California,_Unknown_Date,_B.F._Sisk_Courthouse,_Fresno,_California.jpg|Twenty-nine star seal on the B.F.

Snyder and the men of the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]], which freed California from Mexican rule in 1846.  This addition was objected to by native [[Californio]] [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], former head of the Mexican military in California, but a friend of the United States.  He introduced an amendment to remove the bear, or, if it were to remain, that it be held fast by a [[vaquero]]'s lasso.  The amendment failed.<ref>Winfield J. Davis, \"The Great Seal \u2013 History of the State of California's Coat of Arms,\" ''Sacramento Union'', November 14, 1885, 6</ref>\n\nIn February 1850, the [[The Daily Alta California|''Daily Alta California'']] of San Francisco accused Lyon of taking the $1000 appropriated to him by the convention for the purpose of securing a die and press, but giving a marred design, a die sunk too shallow, and an insufficiently powerful press for the job in return.  The editorial continued that Lyon \"received his money out of the civil fund, and is now conveying it to the sylvan retreats of [[Lyonsdale, New York|Lyonsdale]]\" and quite vehemently stated that Lyon had \"no right or title to the honor of either designing or executing the seal any more than the Kha[n] of Tartary\" while still protecting the anonymity of Garnett.<ref>\"The State Seal,\" ''Daily Alta California'', February 19, 1850, 2</ref>  However, the fact that Garnett was chiefly responsible for the design was known by at least one observer of the convention at the time and generally known no later than December 1849.<ref>Bayard Taylor, \"Bayard Taylor's Letters, No. XXVII,\" ''New York Weekly Tribune'', December 22, 1849, 1</ref>\n\nControversy arose again in 1899 with an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that claimed that Garnett's design was not original, but in fact based upon the seal of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]]' California Lodge No. 1, with a few changes.<ref>\"State Seal Pirated, Say the Odd Fellows,\" ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 5, 1899, 7</ref>  This article was soon followed by a defense of the originality of the design written by Major Garnett's brother, Louis A. Garnett, who claimed that the timing of the creation of and differences between the two seals made it impossible for the state seal to have been based on the lodge seal.<ref name=\"Louis A. Garnett 1899\"/>  Despite this, the Grand Lodge of California continues to make this claim,<ref>[http://www.caioof.org/ The Grand Lodge of California Home Page], accessed July 9, 2011</ref> and an I.O.O.F. historian has suggested that perhaps Garnett in fact designed both seals.<ref>Don R.

Denver]].  Denver, who had been elected to the [[United States Congress]] (and in whose honor the city of [[Denver, Colorado]], was named), left for [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 5, but his resignation was not effective until November 5.  Bigler asked for an immediate resignation and threatened to declare the office vacant and appoint a new Secretary of State if this request was refused.  In the same letter, he also requested that the Great Seal be kept in the Governor's Office.  Denver refused the request, as it would be impossible for him to fulfill his duties without it, and cited the fact that the seal had always been kept in the possession of the Secretary of State.  On October 6, Bigler appointed his private secretary, C.H. Hempstead, to the office, and, accompanied by two witnesses, went to the office of the Secretary of State to have the appointment certified.  Denver's deputy refused to certify, as he argued that the office would not be vacated until November 5, the effective date of Denver's resignation.  It was not until that date that Hempstead's appointment was finally certified.<ref>Summarized from J.N. Bowman, \"The Great Seal of California,\" ''California Blue Book'' (Sacramento: State Printing Office, 1950), 169</ref>\n\nIn 1958, a disagreement arose between Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan and [[State Architect#History|State Architect]] Anson Boyd over the design of the seal being used on state buildings in Sacramento.

A seal can also be found at Metropolitan Barber Shop, at 1018 Bush Street.\n\nAround the Bay Area, other seals can be found at the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]] Parlor No. 62 in [[Napa, California|Napa]] (a six-foot wide stained glass), the historic [[Sonoma Plaza|plaza]] in [[Sonoma, CA|Sonoma]] on the [[California Republic#Bear Flag Revolt|1846 Bear Flag Revolt]] monument (1914), the [[Elihu M Harris State Office Building]] in [[Oakland]], the [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] History Museum in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]] (a mosaic dating to 1910), the [[Circle of Palms Plaza]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the site of California's first state capitol, and in front of [[Colton Hall]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the site of the 1849 Constitutional Convention.  Nearby is a 1957 monument to Robert S. Garnett which includes the seal.\n\n'''A selection of seals found around the San Francisco Bay Area'''\n<gallery>\nFile:2017 Pioneer Monument.jpg|Minerva stands atop the James Lick Pioneer Monument in San Francisco\nFile:The Great Seal of the State of California (TK2).JPG|The very large seal at the CPUC building in San Francisco\nFile:BearFlagMonument SOS3.jpg|At the base of the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt monument in Sonoma\nFile:Kluft-photo-Circle-of-Palms-State-Seal-April-2008-Img_0765.jpg|Seal at the Circle of Palms Plaza in San Jose\n</gallery>\n\n===Southern California===\nA large bronze seal, installed in 1939, was for many years located in front of the First Street entrance to the old State Building in Los Angeles until the structure was torn down in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Portal Walk 1939\"/>  The seal in the atrium of the [[Ronald Reagan]] State Building in Los Angeles is most likely this seal.  Also in downtown Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles County Law Library, a large Seal of California is joined by others representing the various court districts of the area.  At the 1934 California State Fair, Los Angeles-based [[Helms Bakery]] won the gold medal for the best loaf of bread, topping 471 other entries.<ref>\"32 Years Serving the Southland,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', March 3, 1963, A35</ref>  Large reproductions of this medal, showing the seal on one side, can be seen on the exterior of all three former locations in [[Culver City]], [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], and [[San Bernardino]].  As part of his 1932 mural on the ceiling of the Fluor Gallery of the [[Bowers Museum]] in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], artist Martin Syvertsen included a seal. Another seal is attached to the Family Law Court in [[Riverside, CA|Riverside]].\n\nAbove the bench in Courtroom #1 of the [[Superior Courts of California|San Diego Superior Court]] hangs a stained glass [[:File:Seal of California, John Mallon, 1889, San Diego Superior Court.jpg|seal]].  This was one of forty-two state seals created in 1889 (one for each state then in the Union) by artist John Mallon for the courthouse at the time and saved from oblivion in 1978 by civic-minded San Diegans (the courthouse had been torn down in 1959, and the seals placed in storage).<ref>[http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=55,1635949&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL \"Stained Glass Windows \u2013 A Tribute to San Diego County Courts of the Past,\"] Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, accessed March 16, 2011</ref>  Not far from the Superior Court, just outside the entrance doors to the old central library location at 850 E Street, is another seal.

Although the university's version of the Seal still graces its Tower Hall and several other buildings on the San Jose State campus, its fate as the school's official Seal is unclear. In recent years the school has also used a different seal depicting its Tower Hall building. The city of [[Eureka, California]], uses the same seal, being the only U.S. location to use the state seal as its seal.<ref name=\"NSGW\">[http://nsgw66.org/calseal.html Seal of California], Native Sons of the Golden West, Redwood Parlor #66, retrieved February 14, 2013</ref> The city's name identically matches California's motto. Minerva and the bear appear on the seal of the city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].  The seal of the [[Alpine County, California|County of Alpine]] is nearly an exact copy of the state seal, but with most of the elements reversed, as if reflected in a mirror. The Governor's Flag features a modified seal at its center.<ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/GovFlag.html \"The Governor's Flag,\"] The California State Military Museum, accessed July 9, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[California Highway Patrol]] uses a modified state seal on its patch, replacing the wheat and grape vine with a cactus and adding a setting sun, and a seal as part of its shield that is nearly identical to the actual seal.  Most state law enforcement agencies, along with many local and county agencies, display the state seal on their badges.  A fictionalized version of the seal, missing the words \"California\" and \"Eureka\", appeared on officers' shoulder patches used for the television series [[Highway Patrol (U.S. TV series)|''Highway Patrol'']], which, although filmed in southern California, was set in an unnamed western state.  Another made-for-television seal, missing the bear and several ships, and with a wandering island, was used for an episode of the [[CBS]] series ''[[The Mentalist]]''/<ref>[https://twitter.com/Andy_Richter/statuses/231446746956435456 Andy Richter's Twitter page, 3 August 2012, accessed 31 December 2014]</ref> Above Judge Wright's head in the [[NBC]] comedy ''[[Bad Judge]]'' hung an altered seal, missing the ships and a good number of stars.<ref>[http://www.crimefilenews.com/2014/11/judge-rebecca-wright-should-win-appeal.html \"Judge Rebecca Wright Should Win An Appeal With NBC!,\" CrimeFileNews.com, 16 November 2014, accessed 31 December 2014]</ref> During Mr. Peanutbutter's gubernatorial run on the [[Netflix]] series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', a seal with an actual seal in place of Minerva was shown.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:San-Jose-State-College-Eure.gif|San Jose State University's historic Seal, from its days as a California State College\nFile:Seal of Eureka, California.png|Seal of the City of Eureka\nFile:Seal of Long Beach, California.png|Seal of the City of Long Beach\nFile:Seal of Alpine County, California.png|Seal of the County of Alpine\nFile:Flag of the Governor of California.svg|The California State Governor's Flag\nFile:Seal_of_the_California_Highway_Patrol.svg|CHP Shield\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1969, the appearance of the seal on state-owned cars parked in unexpected places was used by concerned Californians to identify public vehicles, financed by taxpayers, being used for non-official duties.  Observed examples included a vehicle parked at a [[Lake Tahoe]] casino and \"a man, woman, and several children piling out of a state owned car and into a movie theatre at 3 p.m.\"<ref>Don Demain, \"A Watch on 'Big Brother,'\" ''Oakland Tribune,'' April 9, 1969, 24</ref>\n\nAs the \"signature\" of California, the seal has also been used for less-than-solemn purposes, including poking fun at the state's problems.  In 1967, soon after Ronald Reagan's inauguration as governor, the ''Sacramento Bee'' ran an editorial cartoon showing an overweight Minerva and bear, representing bloated state government, doing toe-touching exercises as Reagan, dressed as an athletics coach, calls out, \"Squeeze, Cut, Trim \u2013 Squeeze, Cut, Trim.\"<ref>\"Squeeze, Cut, Trim,\" ''Sacramento Bee'', January 15, 1967, B3</ref>  In 2001, the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' printed a letter to the editor with a light-hearted suggestion of new imagery for the seal.  The writer proposed replacing the sailing ships with Japanese [[Car carrier#Car carriers|car carriers]], the wheat and grape vine with [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] subdivisions, obscuring the Sierra Nevada with [[smog]], and giving California a new motto more appropriate for the time:  \"I have lost it.\"<ref>Arthur Carey, \"Seal Stuck with Outdated Images,\" ''Oakland Tribune'', October 6, 2001, Editorial Page</ref>  Ross Mayfield, political cartoonist of the ''Santa Maria Sun'', lampooned California's economic situation with his \"The New State Seal for the Great Bankrupt State of California\" cartoon, which portrayed a worried Minerva holding signs that read \"Send Money\" and \"Need Cash,\" the miner in his (literal and figurative) hole with a \"We're In Too Deep\" sign, and the ships flying \"Bail Us Out\" and \"We're Sinking\" banners.<ref>Ross Mayfield, [http://ifthishadbeenarealemergency.blogspot.com/2011/06/incomplete-ross-mayfield-2011-political.html \"If This Had Been a Real Emergency\" Blog], accessed July 9, 2011</ref>  A version of the seal with [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] in the place of Minerva and California spelled phonetically as 'Kahlifoania' made the rounds soon after Austrian-born [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was elected governor in 2003.\n\n==Government seals of California==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the 40th Governor of California.png|Seal of the [[Governor of California]]\nFile:CaliforniaAssemblySeal.svg|Seal of the [[California State Assembly]]\nFile:Seal of the Senate of the State of California.png|Seal of the [[California State Senate]]\nFile:Seal of California Office of the Controller.svg|Seal of the [[California State Controller]]\nFile:CaliforniaTreasurerSeal.png|Seal of the [[California State Treasurer]]\nFile:Seal of the Supreme Court of California.png|Seal of the [[Supreme Court of California]]\nFile:Seal of the California Department of Boating and Waterways.png|Seal of the [[California Department of Boating and Waterways]]\nFile:Seal of the California Department of Education.jpg|Seal of the [[California Department of Education]]\nFile:Seal of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.gif|Seal of the [[California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]]\nFile:Seal of the California Department of Parks and Recreation.jpg|Seal of the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]]\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*California State Archives: [http://www.sos.ca.gov/digsig/greatseal.htm Long Description for the Great Seal of the State of California]\n*California State Capitol Museum: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012123245/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?content1=1278&Content2=1374&Content3=1294 California Symbols]\n*California State Library: [http://www.library.ca.gov/history/symbols.html State Symbols]\n*John Allen: [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/79001047/The-Great-Seal-of-the-State-of-California \"Peculiarly Appropriate\": The Great Seal of the State of California]\n*Netstate.com: [http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/seals/ca_seal.htm The Great Seal of California]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{US_state_seals}}\n{{California}}\n\n[[Category:Symbols of California]]\n[[Category:United States state seals|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with bears|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with grapes|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with wheat|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with pickaxes|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with shovels|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with ships|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with mountains|California]]\n[[Category:Coats of arms with spears|California]]\n[[category:Athena]]\n", "name_user": "Cclark610", "label": "safe", "comment": "Information on the creation of the current color version of the seal.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_California"}

He is voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]] and was introduced in Season 1's \"[[Bart the General]]\" as an [[antagonist]] but later became a close friend of [[Bart Simpson]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nNelson is a 12-year-old student and [[Bullying|bully]] at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and [[Martin Prince|Martin]], who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\", [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] informally adopts him in \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \"[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]\".\n\nHis family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as [[Lisa's Date with Density|Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him]], [[A Milhouse Divided|Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction]], or [[Bart the Mother|Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \"has bigger problems\"]]), the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at [[Hooters]] or in a topless bar. The [[Characterisation|character design]] and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series.\n\nIt is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \"went to pick up some [[Pop-Tarts]]\" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \"[[Brother from the Same Planet]]\", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \"[[Bart's Girlfriend]]\", depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \"[[Bart Star]]\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \"doesn't want to bother [his] Mom at work\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an [[Anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], covering 90% of his body with large [[tumors]]. Looking like [[Joseph Merrick]], he ran out of the store and encountered a [[circus]] that made him a part of its [[freak show]]. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).\n\nNelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \"[[Bart Star]]\", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even [[Any Given Sundance|submitting a film]] to the [[Sundance Film Festival]] about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/04/the-simpsons-any-given-sundance/ |title=The Simpsons: Any Given Sundance&nbsp;\u2014 VIDEO |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Little Big Girl]]\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \"[[Much Apu About Nothing]]\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student [[\u00dcter Z\u00f6rker|\u00dcter]] for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of [[Andy Williams]] as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \"[[Bart on the Road]]\".\n\n==Relationships with other characters==\nEven though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.\n\nIn [[Bart the General|his debut episode]], Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters|Herman]], who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with [[water balloon]]s. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him.\n\nAlthough still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten]] and occasionally even common bullying target [[Martin Prince]]. In \"[[The Debarted]]\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \"other best friend\", along with Milhouse.\n\nNelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], who believe that kissing girls is \"[[gay]]\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \"[[New Kid On The Block]]\").\n\nHe also punishes [[Sherri and Terri]] for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his \"good side\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \"[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \"[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]\")\n\nIn \"[[Loan-a Lisa]]\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.\n\nThough Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).\n\nIn \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\", [[Moe Szyslak]] appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks.\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Nancy Cartwright.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nancy Cartwright]] voices Nelson, even though the role was not assigned to her originally.]]\n''[[The Simpsons]]'' creator [[Matt Groening]] named Nelson after the [[Nelson hold|wrestling hold of the same name]].<ref>Groening, Matt (2004).

The idea of Nelson dating [[Lisa Simpson]] had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show.<ref>Scully, Mike; Weinstein, Josh (2007). Commentary for the episode \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson \"has evolved the most out of all the characters I do.

He is voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]] and was introduced in Season 1's \"[[Bart the General]]\" as an [[antagonist]] but later became a close friend of [[Bart Simpson]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nNelson is a 12-year-old student and [[Bullying|bully]] at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and [[Martin Prince|Martin]], who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\", [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] informally adopts him in \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \"[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]\".\n\nHis family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as [[Lisa's Date with Density|Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him]], [[A Milhouse Divided|Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction]], or [[Bart the Mother|Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \"has bigger problems\"]]), the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at [[Hooters]] or in a topless bar. The [[Characterisation|character design]] and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series.\n\nIt is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \"went to pick up some [[Pop-Tarts]]\" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \"[[Brother from the Same Planet]]\", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \"[[Bart's Girlfriend]]\", depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \"[[Bart Star]]\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \"doesn't want to bother [his] Mom at work\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an [[Anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], covering 90% of his body with large [[tumors]]. Looking like [[Joseph Merrick]], he ran out of the store and encountered a [[circus]] that made him a part of its [[freak show]]. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).\n\nNelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \"[[Bart Star]]\", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even [[Any Given Sundance|submitting a film]] to the [[Sundance Film Festival]] about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/04/the-simpsons-any-given-sundance/ |title=The Simpsons: Any Given Sundance&nbsp;\u2014 VIDEO |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Little Big Girl]]\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \"[[Much Apu About Nothing]]\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student [[\u00dcter Z\u00f6rker|\u00dcter]] for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of [[Andy Williams]] as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \"[[Bart on the Road]]\".\n\n==Relationships with other characters==\nEven though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.\n\nIn [[Bart the General|his debut episode]], Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters|Herman]], who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with [[water balloon]]s. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him.\n\nAlthough still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten]] and occasionally even common bullying target [[Martin Prince]]. In \"[[The Debarted]]\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \"other best friend\", along with Milhouse.\n\nNelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], who believe that kissing girls is \"[[gay]]\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \"[[New Kid On The Block]]\").\n\nHe also punishes [[Sherri and Terri]] for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his \"good side\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \"[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \"[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]\")\n\nIn \"[[Loan-a Lisa]]\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.\n\nThough Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).\n\nIn \"[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]\", [[Moe Szyslak]] appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks.\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Nancy Cartwright.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nancy Cartwright]] voices Nelson, even though the role was not assigned to her originally.]]\n''[[The Simpsons]]'' creator [[Matt Groening]] named Nelson after the [[Nelson hold|wrestling hold of the same name]].<ref>Groening, Matt (2004).

However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', \"the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me.

Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.\"<ref name=\"cartwright102\"/>\n\nBy the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''The Simpsons'', the [[List of writers of The Simpsons|writers]] had begun to explore the secondary characters of the show. \"[[Lisa's Date with Density]]\" (season eighth, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating [[Lisa Simpson]] had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show.<ref>Scully, Mike; Weinstein, Josh (2007).

Also, people found in possession of marked goods provide the police with solid evidence of criminal activity. Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a uniform property marking system (UPMS) that generated unique identification numbers (UIN) for storage and retrieval on a uniform identification system (UIS). The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience few burglaries than their neighbors. However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens. These companies frequently dispense with marking property or use pre-Internet marking strategies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.serialnumberregistry.ca/  |title=Serial Number Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immobilise.com/  |title=Immobilise |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are newer companies that issue uniquely numbered identifier tags associated with a unique website that allows only the rightful owner of the property to enter and access serial numbers. If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification.

Also, people found in possession of marked goods provide the police with solid evidence of criminal activity. Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a single unique identifier or a system of identifiers being installed to aid police operations. The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited the police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience few burglaries than their neighbors. However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens. These companies frequently dispense with marking property or use pre-Internet marking strategies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.serialnumberregistry.ca/  |title=Serial Number Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immobilise.com/  |title=Immobilise |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are newer companies that issue uniquely numbered identifier tags associated with a unique website that allows only the rightful owner of the property to enter and access serial numbers. If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification.
