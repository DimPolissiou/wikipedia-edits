The team competes in [[Global Rapid Rugby]]{{hsp}}<ref name=rr-mar-2019/> as well as Australia's [[National Rugby Championship]].<ref name=fs-dec-2017/>\n\nThe Force previously played in [[Super Rugby]] from [[2006 Super 14 season|2006]] to [[2017 Super Rugby season|2017]]. As the fourth Australian franchise to join the competition, the Force played for twelve seasons in Super Rugby, with their highest finish being seventh place. In 2017, the [[Australian Rugby Union]] reduced the number of Australian Super Rugby teams, and the Western Force lost their licence to participate in the competition at the end of that season.<ref name=aru-aug-2017/>\n\n==History==\n===The bid===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe bid for entry into an expanded Super 12 competition started in the early 2000s, when in 2002, a group was formed to oversee developments in the push for a new Australian franchise. The group's objective was to ensure that if SANZAR agreed to a fourth Australian franchise, that [[RugbyWA]] would be ready. RugbyWA were invited to bid for the fourth Australian team, and the union assembled a project team, which was given four weeks to formulate their bid. The bid was backed by the state government, which loaned more than one million dollars to RugbyWA, as well as committing $25 million towards an upgrade of the Members Equity Stadium. It was announced in December 2004 that RugbyWA had beaten Rugby Union Victoria for the right to host the fourth Australian franchise.\n\n===The first season===\n[[File:Force runout lightened.jpg|thumb|300px|The Force run out in their first game against the Brumbies]]\nOn 10 February the Western Force made their [[2006 Super 14 season|2006 season]] rugby debut against the [[Brumbies Rugby|Brumbies]] at a near sold out Subiaco Oval in Perth, losing 25\u201310.  Since this result, the Force have had a difficult debut in Super 14. A one-sided loss to the Hurricanes and an ugly loss at home to the Chiefs in Perth followed. Many fans were unimpressed, with only approximately 23,000 turning up to watch a match against the [[Bulls (rugby union)|Bulls]]. On 31 March, in front of 24,000, the Force came closest to their first win, losing 26\u201325 to the [[Stormers (rugby club)|Stormers]] at Subiaco Oval. This was after leading 10\u20130 early on in the match. This was the Force's first competition point ever, and is the longest it has ever taken a side to get a point in Super rugby history (8 rounds/7 matches).\n\nOn 21 April a crowd of 32,231<ref name=\"crusaders\">{{cite web | url=http://www.planetrugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50575.shtml/| title=Force hold Crusaders to a draw | website=planetrugby.com| accessdate=15 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910122126/http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50575.shtml|archivedate=10 September 2006}}</ref> saw the Force nearly pull off the upset of the year, drawing 23-all with the undefeated defending champion [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]]. Though the Force were leading 7\u20130 after several minutes the feeling was still that the Crusaders would win, especially after they scored a try seconds later to make it 7\u20135. Only when the Force had blown the score out to 17\u20135 did anyone begin to talk of an upset. Leading 20\u20138 at half time the Force did not hold on for the win after the Crusaders scored two tries and a penalty within the closing half. At 23-all with seconds left the Force crashed over the line but were denied by the television match official.\n\nTwo days after the draw with the Crusaders, the Force were able to sign rising star [[Matt Giteau]] from the Brumbies, effective with the 2007 season. Giteau, whose contract with the Brumbies ended after the 2006 season, inked a three-year deal reportedly worth [[Australian dollar|A$]]4.5 million, making him the highest-paid player in the history of any Australian football code.<ref name=\"giteau\">{{cite web | url=http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50593.shtml| title=Western Force win race for Giteau | website=planetrugby.com| accessdate=15 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032908/http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50593.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn Saturday 6 May the Force announced they had managed to sign another player, Reds winger [[Drew Mitchell]].

Months of detailed community involvement went into selecting the name for the team. 'Western Force' was chosen as the name, which best reflected the franchise's location (state) and its 'values of strength, energy and community'. The logo was unveiled to be a black swan, which is the state's traditional insignia. The swan is set in a blue background, representing the Western Australia coastline and sky, whilst the gold represented the beaches, mineral wealth and sunshine. Some speculated that the team was going to be called the 'Black Swans'.\n\nIn July at function at the same venue as where the logo was unveiled to the public, the Force's jersey and naming rights sponsor was revealed. The home jersey was unveiled on [[Brendan Cannon]], being blue with a black swan. [[Lachlan MacKay]] emerged with the side's alternate strip, which was gold with a black swan; black and gold being the State colours of [[Western Australia]]. The team's first jersey was auctioned off for $30,000, and the first alternate strip was then also auctioned off for $30,000 as well.\n\n===Logo===\nIn March 2018, a new renewed Western Force changed their logo and jersey. The logo was very similar to the previous logo, this came after being axed from their most recent season of [[2017 Super Rugby season|Super Rugby]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/western-force/renewed-western-force-reveal-new-logo-jumper-ng-b88763504z|title=Renewed Western Force reveal new logo, jumper|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|date=4 March 2018}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Western Force logo old.svg|<center>2006\u20132018</center>\nImage:Western Force logo new.svg|<center>2018\u2013present</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==Support==\nShortly after RugbyWA won the fourth Australian franchise, an on-line register was set up for members to record their interest. In the space of weeks, 10,000 people had registered. When membership was officially launched in July, more than 13,000 were registered, with around 400 companies expressed interest in hospitality packages. Soon the Force had the largest membership base of any of the Australian Super 14 teams. By the time pre-season had started, the Force had 16,000 members.\n\nAustralian Rugby Union CEO Gary Flowers told the media that \"people power\" was a key factor in Western Australia being awarded the franchise ahead of Victoria. Prior to the announcement, more than 25,500 Western Australians signed a petition in support of their state's bid. In addition, 5,000 people, including the state's premier Dr Geoff Gallop, attended a rally at Subiaco Oval, organised by two rugby mothers \"the Scrum Mums\" (Jennifer Hoskins and Irma Cooper) to show how much the people of Western Australia wanted the franchise. By the end of the first season, the Force finished with the highest crowd average out of all the Australian teams, despite finishing in last place, the fans still came out to see [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallaby]] stars such as [[Matt Giteau]], [[Drew Mitchell]] and [[Nathan Sharpe]] (though Mitchell and Giteau were not in the 2006 line-up).\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Nib Stadium.jpg|right|thumb|320px|HBF Park, home of the Western Force since 2010]]\nFor the first four seasons, the Force played all of their home games at [[Subiaco Oval]]. The stadium had a capacity of 43,500<ref>[http://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/dsrwr/_assets/main/lib50137/background.pdf Major Stadia Taskforce \u2013 Background]</ref> configured in an oval shape for [[Australian rules football]].\n\nThe club moved to the [[Perth Oval]] for the 2010 season and, with association football club [[Perth Glory]], pushed for an upgrade to the venue which would create a rectangular venue for the two clubs. As of 2019, the stadium is known as HBF Park after WA\u2019s biggest health insurer took over naming rights at Perth\u2019s home of soccer and rugby.<ref>https://www.hbf.com.au/media-releases/hbf-to-be-new-sponsor-of-perth-rectangular-stadium</ref> The Force were given a limited grant by the government to improve facilities at the stadium, and the capacity was increased to 20,500 in time for the 2010 Super Rugby Season.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2011 the State government developed a masterplan for an improved rectangular stadium and then completed a business case which saw $88million dollars allocated to the first stage which was to include a new permanent East stand, new lights, two video replay boards, LED signage at pitch level, replacement of the playing surface and replacement of the south scaffold stand with new scaffold. A Project Definition Plan was then completed and following this, the government allocated a further $7.14million to add corporate amenity including 48 corporate boxes and a 250-seat BBQ deck to the new Eastern stand.\n\nIn June 2012 builder [[Buckeridge Group of Companies|BGC]] were awarded the head building contract for the project and on 7 June 2012 the Minister for Sport and Recreation Terry Waldron MLA announced that hard work by the project team, led by the Department of Sport and Recreation, and a keen price by builders would enable the south stand to become a permanent, unroofed structure rather than new scaffold. It was completed in September 2013, with a capacity of 20,441.\n\n=={{anchor|A|U19|U20}}Development teams==\n[[File:Matt Hodgson jumping at a kick off.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Western Force Gold playing Japanese team [[Yamaha Jubilo]] in 2006.]]\n\nRugbyWA's two elite development squads just below full-time professional level are the Western Force A and WA Under 19 teams. These teams are closely aligned with the Western Force and train at [[UWA Sports Park|McGillvray Oval]], the training base used by the Force. RugbyWA also previously fielded a separate [[National Rugby Championship]] team, the [[Perth Spirit]], until the end of season 2017 but competed in this tournament as the Western Force from 2018. From 2019 the Development Team, Perth Gold, competes in [[National Rugby Championship|Emerging State Championship]].<ref>https://wa.rugby/news/2019/09/26/perth-gold-team-selected-and-ready-to-fire-in-adelaide-for-the-nrc-ii-competition</ref>\n\n===Western Force A===\nThe Western Force A team plays matches against interstate and international representative teams, and has also competed in tournaments such as the [[Pacific Rugby Cup]]. Teams known by various names over the years including Western Force A, Western Force Gold and Force Academy have been selected from the best emerging rugby talent in Western Australia. The current squad is a mix of Western Force contracted players, Force Academy players from elite youth programs, and selected [[RugbyWA#premier|Premier Grade]] club rugby players.<ref name=ruggaworld-2006/>\n\nIn 2006 the Western Force Gold, playing in the traditional gold and black colours of Western Australia, undertook a two-week tour to South Africa.

Alcohol was said to be a factor.\n\nAs a result of the actions, Australian Wallaby [[Number eight (rugby union)|number 8]] Fava was ordered to pay $11,000, attend a week of community service and undergo counselling for alcohol abuse, while [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] Richard Brown was sentenced to a $5000 fine as well as seven days' community service. Both fines were payable to the Rottnest Island Conservation Foundation.\n\nIn February 2008, Matt Henjak and Haig Sare were involved in a fight at a pub in Perth. Henjak hit Sare and broke his jaw and was sacked by the Force for misconduct. Haig Sare returned to play for the Force at the end of Season 2008 once his injuries healed.\n\n===Firepower funding debacle===\nSponsorship payments from the fuel technology company [[Firepower International|Firepower]] were a major factor in luring Wallaby star Matt Giteau and others to play for the Western Force in Perth.<ref>{{cite web\n | first = Justin | last = Chadwick | date = 27 May 2008\n | title = Firepower debacle hits Matt Giteau, Western Force\n | work = PerthNow/The Sunday Times \n | url = http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/rugby-union/firepower-debacle-hits-giteau/story-e6frg263-1111116467742\n | accessdate =29 September 2010}}\n</ref> The luckless Giteau was one of a number of sportsmen owed millions of dollars after the collapse of Firepower.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jacquelin |last=Magnay|first2=Gerard |last2=Ryle|url=http://www.rugbyheaven.com.au/news/super14/the-games-almost-up-for-firepower/2008/05/27/1211654034343.html |title=The game's almost up for Firepower|work=Rugby Heaven |publisher=Fairfax|date=28 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202050215/http://www.rugbyheaven.com.au/news/super14/the-games-almost-up-for-firepower/2008/05/27/1211654034343.html|archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref>\nA new consortium offered to cover the Firepower money if Giteau extended his existing contract,<ref>''[http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/rugby/giteau-rejects-16m-force-offer/story-e6frg263-1111117918742 Matt Giteau rejects $1.6m Force offer]'' PerthNow, 1 November 2008</ref> however he chose not to, and returned to Canberra to play for the [[Brumbies (rugby)|Brumbies]].<ref>''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/21/2497711.htm Giteau to return to Brumbies]'' ABC News, 21 February 2009</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Women|W}} Women's team==\n\nThe RugbyWA Women, previously known as the Western Force Women,<ref name=\"19 January 2019\">{{cite web |title=Super W: RugbyWA Women unveil new squad and old-school look |url=https://www.rugby.com.au/news/2019/01/19/rugbywa-women |website=Rugby.com.au |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403224704/https://www.rugby.com.au/news/2019/01/19/rugbywa-women |archivedate=3 April 2019}}</ref> play in the [[Super W]] competition.

The team competes in [[Global Rapid Rugby]]{{hsp}}<ref name=rr-mar-2019/> as well as Australia's [[National Rugby Championship]].<ref name=fs-dec-2017/>\n\nThe Force previously played in [[Super Rugby]] from [[2006 Super 14 season|2006]] to [[2017 Super Rugby season|2017]]. As the fourth Australian franchise to join the competition, the Force played for twelve seasons in Super Rugby, with their highest finish being seventh place. In 2017, the [[Australian Rugby Union]] reduced the number of Australian Super Rugby teams, and the Western Force lost their licence to participate in the competition at the end of that season.<ref name=aru-aug-2017/>\n\n==History==\n===The bid===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe bid for entry into an expanded Super 12 competition started in the early 2000s, when in 2002, a group was formed to oversee developments in the push for a new Australian franchise. The group's objective was to ensure that if SANZAR agreed to a fourth Australian franchise, that [[RugbyWA]] would be ready. RugbyWA were invited to bid for the fourth Australian team, and the union assembled a project team, which was given four weeks to formulate their bid. The bid was backed by the state government, which loaned more than one million dollars to RugbyWA, as well as committing $25 million towards an upgrade of the Members Equity Stadium. It was announced in December 2004 that RugbyWA had beaten Rugby Union Victoria for the right to host the fourth Australian franchise.\n\n===The first season===\n[[Image:Force runout lightened.jpg|thumb|300px|The Force run out in their first game against the Brumbies]]\nOn 10 February the Western Force made their [[2006 Super 14 season|2006 season]] rugby debut against the [[Brumbies Rugby|Brumbies]] at a near sold out Subiaco Oval in Perth, losing 25\u201310.  Since this result, the Force have had a difficult debut in Super 14. A one-sided loss to the Hurricanes and an ugly loss at home to the Chiefs in Perth followed. Many fans were unimpressed, with only approximately 23,000 turning up to watch a match against the [[Bulls (rugby union)|Bulls]]. On 31 March, in front of 24,000, the Force came closest to their first win, losing 26\u201325 to the [[Stormers (rugby club)|Stormers]] at Subiaco Oval. This was after leading 10\u20130 early on in the match. This was the Force's first competition point ever, and is the longest it has ever taken a side to get a point in Super rugby history (8 rounds/7 matches).\n\nOn 21 April a crowd of 32,231<ref name=\"crusaders\">{{cite web | url=http://www.planetrugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50575.shtml/| title=Force hold Crusaders to a draw | website=planetrugby.com| accessdate=15 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910122126/http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50575.shtml|archivedate=10 September 2006}}</ref> saw the Force nearly pull off the upset of the year, drawing 23-all with the undefeated defending champion [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]]. Though the Force were leading 7\u20130 after several minutes the feeling was still that the Crusaders would win, especially after they scored a try seconds later to make it 7\u20135. Only when the Force had blown the score out to 17\u20135 did anyone begin to talk of an upset. Leading 20\u20138 at half time the Force did not hold on for the win after the Crusaders scored two tries and a penalty within the closing half. At 23-all with seconds left the Force crashed over the line but were denied by the television match official.\n\nTwo days after the draw with the Crusaders, the Force were able to sign rising star [[Matt Giteau]] from the Brumbies, effective with the 2007 season. Giteau, whose contract with the Brumbies ended after the 2006 season, inked a three-year deal reportedly worth [[Australian dollar|A$]]4.5 million, making him the highest-paid player in the history of any Australian football code.<ref name=\"giteau\">{{cite web | url=http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50593.shtml| title=Western Force win race for Giteau | website=planetrugby.com| accessdate=15 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032908/http://www.planet-rugby.com/Tournaments/Super_12/story_50593.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn Saturday 6 May the Force announced they had managed to sign another player, Reds winger [[Drew Mitchell]].

Months of detailed community involvement went into selecting the name for the team. 'Western Force' was chosen as the name, which best reflected the franchise's location (state) and its 'values of strength, energy and community'. The logo was unveiled to be a black swan, which is the state's traditional insignia. The swan is set in a blue background, representing the Western Australia coastline and sky, whilst the gold represented the beaches, mineral wealth and sunshine. Some speculated that the team was going to be called the 'Black Swans'.\n\nIn July at function at the same venue as where the logo was unveiled to the public, the Force's jersey and naming rights sponsor was revealed. The home jersey was unveiled on [[Brendan Cannon]], being blue with a black swan. [[Lachlan MacKay]] emerged with the side's alternate strip, which was gold with a black swan; black and gold being the State colours of [[Western Australia]]. The team's first jersey was auctioned off for $30,000, and the first alternate strip was then also auctioned off for $30,000 as well.\n\n===Logo===\nIn March 2018, a new renewed Western Force changed their logo and jersey. The logo was very similar to the previous logo, this came after being axed from their most recent season of [[2017 Super Rugby season|Super Rugby]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/western-force/renewed-western-force-reveal-new-logo-jumper-ng-b88763504z|title=Renewed Western Force reveal new logo, jumper|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|date=4 March 2018}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Western Force logo old.svg|<center>2006\u20132018</center>\nImage:Western Force logo new.svg|<center>2018\u2013present</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==Support==\nShortly after RugbyWA won the fourth Australian franchise, an on-line register was set up for members to record their interest. In the space of weeks, 10,000 people had registered. When membership was officially launched in July, more than 13,000 were registered, with around 400 companies expressed interest in hospitality packages. Soon the Force had the largest membership base of any of the Australian Super 14 teams. By the time pre-season had started, the Force had 16,000 members.\n\nAustralian Rugby Union CEO Gary Flowers told the media that \"people power\" was a key factor in Western Australia being awarded the franchise ahead of Victoria. Prior to the announcement, more than 25,500 Western Australians signed a petition in support of their state's bid. In addition, 5,000 people, including the state's premier Dr Geoff Gallop, attended a rally at Subiaco Oval, organised by two rugby mothers \"the Scrum Mums\" (Jennifer Hoskins and Irma Cooper) to show how much the people of Western Australia wanted the franchise. By the end of the first season, the Force finished with the highest crowd average out of all the Australian teams, despite finishing in last place, the fans still came out to see [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallaby]] stars such as [[Matt Giteau]], [[Drew Mitchell]] and [[Nathan Sharpe]] (though Mitchell and Giteau were not in the 2006 line-up).\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Nib Stadium.jpg|right|thumb|320px|HBF Park, home of the Western Force since 2010]]\nFor the first four seasons, the Force played all of their home games at [[Subiaco Oval]]. The stadium had a capacity of 43,500<ref>[http://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/dsrwr/_assets/main/lib50137/background.pdf Major Stadia Taskforce \u2013 Background]</ref> configured in an oval shape for [[Australian rules football]].\n\nThe club moved to the [[Perth Oval]] for the 2010 season and, with association football club [[Perth Glory]], pushed for an upgrade to the venue which would create a rectangular venue for the two clubs. As of 2019, the stadium is known as HBF Park after WA\u2019s biggest health insurer took over naming rights at Perth\u2019s home of soccer and rugby.<ref>https://www.hbf.com.au/media-releases/hbf-to-be-new-sponsor-of-perth-rectangular-stadium</ref> The Force were given a limited grant by the government to improve facilities at the stadium, and the capacity was increased to 20,500 in time for the 2010 Super Rugby Season.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2011 the State government developed a masterplan for an improved rectangular stadium and then completed a business case which saw $88million dollars allocated to the first stage which was to include a new permanent East stand, new lights, two video replay boards, LED signage at pitch level, replacement of the playing surface and replacement of the south scaffold stand with new scaffold. A Project Definition Plan was then completed and following this, the government allocated a further $7.14million to add corporate amenity including 48 corporate boxes and a 250-seat BBQ deck to the new Eastern stand.\n\nIn June 2012 builder [[Buckeridge Group of Companies|BGC]] were awarded the head building contract for the project and on 7 June 2012 the Minister for Sport and Recreation Terry Waldron MLA announced that hard work by the project team, led by the Department of Sport and Recreation, and a keen price by builders would enable the south stand to become a permanent, unroofed structure rather than new scaffold. It was completed in September 2013, with a capacity of 20,441.\n\n=={{anchor|A|U19|U20}}Development teams==\n[[Image:Matt Hodgson jumping at a kick off.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Western Force Gold playing Japanese team [[Yamaha Jubilo]] in 2006.]]\n\nRugbyWA's two elite development squads just below full-time professional level are the Western Force A and WA Under 19 teams. These teams are closely aligned with the Western Force and train at [[UWA Sports Park|McGillvray Oval]], the training base used by the Force. RugbyWA also previously fielded a separate [[National Rugby Championship]] team, the [[Perth Spirit]], until the end of season 2017 but competed in this tournament as the Western Force from 2018.

{"title_page": "Astronomical clock (Besan\u00e7on)", "text_new": "[[File:Horloge astronomique Besancon.jpg|thumb|250px|The astronomical clock in [[Besan\u00e7on Cathedral]]]]\n\nThe '''astronomical clock of Besan\u00e7on''' is housed in [[Besan\u00e7on Cathedral]]. Auguste-Lucien V\u00e9rit\u00e9 [[:fr:Auguste-Lucien V\u00e9rit\u00e9]] of [[Beauvais]] designed and built [[Besan\u00e7on]]'s present [[astronomical clock]], between 1858 and 1863. It replaced earlier clock that Bernardin constructed in the 1850s and which proved unsatisfactory. Besan\u00e7on's clock differs from those in [[Strasbourg astronomical clock|Strasbourg]], [[Lyon Cathedral|Lyon]], and [[Beauvais Cathedral|Beauvais]]. The clock is meant to express the theological concept that each second of the day the [[Resurrection of Christ]] transforms the existence of man and of the world.\n\n==Bernardin's clock==\nA clockmaker called Bernardin made the first astronomical clock installed in Besan\u00e7on between 1851 and 1857. Bernadin is probably Constant Flavien Bernardin, born 15 January 1819, probably in Fougerolles, who probably came from [[Fougerolles, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Fougerolles]] and lived in [[Saint-Loup-sur-Semouse]]. (This Bernardin is not to be confused with Br Bernardin Morin who during the same period constructed the astronomical clock at [[Plo\u00ebrmel]]).\n\nBernardin had exhibited an astronomical clock in 1849 while he was living at [[Fougerolles, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Fougerolles]]<ref>''Rapport du jury central sur les produits de l'agriculture et de l'industrie expos\u00e9s en 1849'', page 502</ref> The clock he made for Besan\u00e7on was exhibited in Paris in 1855, where V\u00e9rit\u00e9 was also exhibiting and he could certainly have seen it. This clock was described in the 1958 article by [[Ren\u00e9 Baillaud]].\n\n==V\u00e9rit\u00e9's clock==\nBy 1857 Bernardin's clock had stopped working, and Cardinal Mathieu, the [[Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on]], commissioned a replacement from V\u00e9rit\u00e9, who built it in his workshop in Beauvais. The clock was installed in 1860 but work on it continued until 1863. Immediately after he finished the Besan\u00e7on commission, V\u00e9rit\u00e9 built an even larger, and different, clock, for Beauvais Cathedral.\n\nBernardin's clock may well provided a point of departure for V\u00e9rit\u00e9 when designing his, but apart from general inspiration no specific element seems to have been copied from the earlier one.\n\nIn 1900 the clock stopped working; Florian Goudey completely renovated it.\n\nIn 1966, the clock stopped again on the death of Paul Brandibas, who had been its keeper for over thirty years. The Ungerer company of [[Strasbourg]] renovated it and restored it to full working order.\n\n==Description==\nThe clock stands 5.8 meters high and 2.5 meters wide, and has 30,000 mechanical parts and 11 movements. It sits in its own room in the clocktower. Verite's [[coat of arms]], those of Cardinal Mathieu, and of the cathedral appear on the front of the clock.\n\n*Seventy dials provide 122 indications. These include the seconds, hours, days and years. The clock is a perpetual one that can register up to 10,000 years, including adjustments for leap year cycles. The clock also indicates the times of sunrise and sunset.\n*Twenty-one automated figures either ring the quarter-hour and the hour, or perform the [[Resurrection of Christ]] at noon, and his burial at 3 pm.\n*The clock also has animated pictures of seven different French harbours; dials indicate the hours and height of the tides there. One of the harbours is [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]]; another is [[Cayenne]], French Guiana. There is an eighth animated picture, this one of [[Saint Helena]], where the former emperor [[Napoleon]] died in exile.  \n*An [[orrery]] (planetarium) is part of the clock and it shows the motions and orbits of the planets. The planetary motions are congruent with those of the actual planets so that the planetarium reproduces eclipses as they occur. \n*The central part of the main body of the clock has 12 dials for parts of the civil calendar, and five for the liturgical calendars. The dials showing the civil calendar show the month, date, day, the solar element that gave its name to the day of the week (e.g., the sun for Sunday), the season, the sign of the Zodiac, the length of the day, the length of the night, the seconds, and the times for sunrise and sunset. One dial gives the date of Easter, and this acts as the driver for dials that present the date for five key days of the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar. \n*Two columns have 10 dials each. The bottom eight dials show the time in different major cities around the world, including New York and San Francisco, though without adjustment for daylight saving time, which did not exist at the time the clock was built. The two top dials on the left column show the number of solar and lunar eclipses in the current year. The two dials on the right column show the leap years and leap centuries. The hand on the leap century dial moved for the first time in 2000; it will move for the second time in 2400.\n*A pyramidal arrangement of figures caps the clock. The 12 apostles form the base; two different apostles come out each hour to strike the hour. Also, every hour the three virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, move, with Faith showing the chalice to Charity and Hope, which stand to her right and left. Above them the statues of the archangels Michael and Gabriel strike the quarter-hours. \n*At the top of the clock, at midday, Christ arises from his tomb, and at the 3p.m. he returns to it. When he arises, Mary, his mother and Queen of the world, raises her sceptre; she lowers it when he returns to his tomb. \n*Through a system of universal joints extending some 100 meters, the clock drives four dials that sit on the four sides of the cathedral's tower, thus providing the time of day to the city. A fifth dial is inside the cathedral. The outside dials also show, respectively, the season, the day of the week, and the month of the year. Cables from the clock activate bells in the tower that sound the quarter hour and the hour.\n*Eleven different descending weights drive the clock. Three of the weights need to be reset each day.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Open==\n*1 April to 30 September: Open every day except Tuesday\n*1 October to 31 March: Everyday except Tuesday and Wednesday\n*Closed: January, 1 May, 1 & 11 November, and 25 December\n*Guided tours (when open): 9:50am, 10:50am, 2:50pm, 3:50pm, and 4:50pm\n\n==References and external links==\n*Bernardin's clock:\n**''Rapport du jury central sur les produits de l'agriculture et de l'industrie expos\u00e9s en 1849'', 1850, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090216090010/http://cnum.cnam.fr/fSYN/8XAE29.html page 502] (on the clock exhibited in 1849)\n** Ren\u00e9 Baillaud: \"Histoire de l'horloge astronomique de la Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean de Besan\u00e7on\", ''Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Besan\u00e7on, proc\u00e8s-verbaux et m\u00e9moires'', volume 172, 1958, pages 350-367\n** Henri Edouard Tresca, Ch.

His charisma is matched by his obsessive and controlling personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. The superstitious Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and often stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes. \n\nAfter designing a new gown for a revered client, Countess Henrietta Harding, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a foreign waitress, Alma Elson. He asks her to have dinner with him, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.\n\nAt first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds\u2019 work, but he proves aloof, hard to please, and overly finicky. They begin to bicker. When Alma tries to show her love for Reynolds by preparing a romantic dinner for two, he lashes out, saying he will not tolerate deviations from the routines he has worked hard to perfect. Alma \u201cretaliates\u201d by poisoning Reynolds\u2019 tea with wild mushrooms gathered outside his country house. As he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, Reynolds collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and has hallucinations of his mother. Alma nurses him back to health. He asks her to marry him; she accepts.\n\nAfter a brief honeymoon, Reynolds and Alma soon start bickering again. Cyril reveals to Reynolds that the Countess is now a client at a rival fashion house, and hints that his classical designs have begun appearing out-of-date. As Reynolds feels his work is suffering, he concludes it may be time to break up with Alma, who overhears the conversation. \n\nAt the country house, Alma responds by making Reynolds a poisoned omelet. As he chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him. Reynolds swallows the omelet and tells her to kiss him. As Reynolds lies ill, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner. She acknowledges that while there may be challenges ahead, their love and their new arrangement can overcome them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]<ref name=\"Jun2016V\">{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Paul Thomas Anderson, Daniel Day-Lewis Eye Reunion on 1950s Fashion Drama (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson-fashion-movie-1201768423/|accessdate=June 6, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=June 2, 2016}}</ref> as Reynolds Woodcock\n* [[Lesley Manville]]<ref name=\"Feb2017D\">{{cite news|last1=Lodderhose|first1=Diana|title=Focus\u2019 New Paul Thomas Anderson Pic Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Adds Lesley Manville & Vicky Krieps|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/lesley-manville-focus-features-paul-thomas-anderson-focus-features-daniel-day-lewis-1201900101/|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> as Cyril Woodcock\n* [[Vicky Krieps]]<ref name=\"Feb2017D\"/> as Alma Elson\n* [[Camilla Rutherford]] as Johanna\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Countess Henrietta Harding\n* George Glasgow as Nigel Cheddar-Goode\n* [[Brian Gleeson (actor)|Brian Gleeson]] as Dr. Robert Hardy\n* [[Harriet Sansom Harris]] as Barbara Rose\n* Lujza Richter as Princess Mona Braganza\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Lady Baltimore\n* [[Nicholas Mander]] as Lord Baltimore\n* [[Philip Franks]] as Peter Martin\n* [[Phyllis MacMahon]] as Tippy\n* [[Silas Carson]] as Rubio Gurrerro\n* [[Richard Graham (actor)|Richard Graham]]<ref name=\"Jan2017TFS\">{{cite news|last1=Raup|first1=Jordan|title=Lesley Manville & More Join Paul Thomas Anderson's Next Film;

His charisma is matched by his obsessive and controlling personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. The superstitious Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and often stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes. \n\nAfter designing a new gown for a revered client, Countess Henrietta Harding, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a foreign waitress, Alma Elson. He asks her to have dinner with him, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his model, muse, and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.\n\nAt first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds\u2019 work, but he proves aloof, hard to please, and overly finicky. They begin to bicker. When Alma tries to show her love for Reynolds by preparing a romantic dinner for two, he lashes out, saying he will not tolerate deviations from the routines he has worked hard to perfect. Alma \u201cretaliates\u201d by poisoning Reynolds\u2019 tea with wild mushrooms gathered outside his country house. As he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, Reynolds collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and has hallucinations of his mother. Alma nurses him back to health. He asks her to marry him; she accepts.\n\nAfter a brief honeymoon, Reynolds and Alma soon start bickering again. Cyril reveals to Reynolds that the Countess is now a client at a rival fashion house, and hints that his classical designs have begun appearing out-of-date. As Reynolds feels his work is suffering, he concludes it may be time to break up with Alma, who overhears the conversation. \n\nAt the country house, Alma responds by making Reynolds a poisoned omelet. As he chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him. Reynolds swallows the omelet and tells her to kiss him. As Reynolds lies ill, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner.

She was recognized as a lawyer by the [[Malaysian Bar]] in January 2003 and was subsequently admitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania after obtaining a Certificate of Legal Practice in Tasmania. Yeoh then served as a lawyer in Petaling Jaya for three years before moving to the ceremony management company in 2006.\n\n==Political career==\nDriven by Edward Ling, her schoolmate, to join the world of politics, both Yeoh and Ling joined the Damansara [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) Branch in the late 2006. Yeoh opted to join the DAP even though the party was an opposition party as she felt that the stand of the political party is the most consistent, though its leaders are often threatened by the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] which allows for arrest without any trial.\n\nInspired by [[Tony Pua]], Damansara Branch Chairman, who resigned to join DAP full-time, Yeoh followed Pua's footsteps and resigned shortly before the March 2008 general election to devote her full-time as a politician.\n\nYeoh was elected as the Selangor state assemblyperson for the seat of Subang Jaya in the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2008/03/10/billi-takes-defeat-in-his-stride/|title=Billi takes defeat in his stride|date=10 March 2008|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|publisher=Star Publications|accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>Lourdes, Mark.

born 9 January 1979) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] [[politician]] from the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) currently serving as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysia]] for [[Segambut (federal constituency)|Segambut]] constituency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\nYeoh is also the former [[Speaker of Selangor State Legislative Assembly|Speaker]] and a two-term assemblywoman of the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]] for [[Subang Jaya (state constituency)|Subang Jaya]] constituency. Yeoh is also the former Deputy Minister of Women, Family and Community Development.\n\n==Background==\nBorn in Subang Jaya, Yeoh studied at SK Sri Subang Jaya, SRK SS19 and SMK Subang Utama, after which she continued her studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia and obtained her law degree in 2001. She was recognized as a lawyer by the [[Malaysian Bar]] in January 2003 and was subsequently admitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania after obtaining a Certificate of Legal Practice in Tasmania. Yeoh then served as a lawyer in Petaling Jaya for three years before moving to the ceremony management company in 2006.\n\n==Political career==\nDriven by Edward Ling, her schoolmate, to join the world of politics, both Yeoh and Ling joined the Damansara [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) Branch in the late 2006. Yeoh opted to join the DAP even though the party was an opposition party as she felt that the stand of the political party is the most consistent, though its leaders are often threatened by the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] which allows for arrest without any trial.\n\nInspired by [[Tony Pua]], Damansara Branch Chairman, who resigned to join DAP full-time, Yeoh followed Pua's footsteps and resigned shortly before the March 2008 general election to devote her full-time as a politician.\n\nYeoh was elected as the Selangor state assemblyperson for the seat of Subang Jaya in the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2008/03/10/billi-takes-defeat-in-his-stride/|title=Billi takes defeat in his stride|date=10 March 2008|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|publisher=Star Publications|accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>Lourdes, Mark.

The national attention Bigtree gained with the movie and its promotion tour allowed the newly-formed group to quickly assume a leading role among the anti-vaccination movement.{{R|selz}}{{R|CWeeks}}{{R|Jez}} Scientists have countered many of ICAN's statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.{{R|v3}}{{R|v4}}{{R|v5}}{{R|v6}}\n\nICAN was established with a $100,000 grant from the Selz Foundation. Its budget ballooned to $1.4 million in 2017, with one million coming from the Selz Foundation, making ICAN the most well-funded anti-vaccination group in the United States that year.{{R|NBC}} ICAN pays a salary of $146,000 to Del Bigtree as its CEO and $98,000 to its Chief Administrative Officer Catharine Layton.{{R|selz}} An article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' states that Layton stumbled upon the anti-vaccine movement on social media after her two sons were diagnosed with autism.{{R|rolling|p=1|q=Layton says her two sons received autism diagnoses after receiving the MMR and pneumonia booster vaccines, respectively; she stumbled on the anti-vaxx community on social media while doing research, and she says that one of her sons has since recovered. }}\n\nIn 2019, Bigtree was a keynote speaker at several anti-vaccination events targeting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn and in Rockland County.{{R|selz}}{{R|ArsT}} He has been criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] for wearing a [[Star of David]] at an anti-vaccination event, attempting to compare the treatment of those opposed to vaccination with the [[Yellow badge|persecution of the Jewish people]].{{R|jta}}{{R|th}}{{R|jos}}{{R|Denton}} Bigtree's anti-vaccine advocacy has been described by anti-vaccination movement critic [[physician]] [[David Gorski]] as \"fear mongering based on misinformation\".{{R|Gorski}}\n\n==Access to information lawsuit==\n\nIn 2018, ICAN filed [[Freedom of information]] lawsuits to force the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]] to release administrative reports on childhood vaccine injury HHS is required to file with Congress. HHS replied that that they could not find any such reports.{{R|selz | p=1 | q=In 2018, the organization filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services. The suits sought to compel the release of data and documents related to vaccine safety. }}{{R|factcheck | p=1 | q=The claim, Reiss said, stems from a public information request filed by the Informed Consent Action Network seeking administrative reports that HHS had filed with Congress. Though the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires HHS to file such reports, HHS said they couldn&apos;t find any in a search.}}\n\nWhile ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines,{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=In a July 2018 post on its website, the Informed Consent Action Network says, \"HHS has not acted in its duties regarding vaccine safety, forcing 78 million American children into a vaccine program with no safety provisions.\"}}\nscientists and the fact-checking site [[Politifact]] pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports.{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=However, Reiss said, while HHS said they couldn\u2019t find the reports the Informed Consent Action Network requested, \"that is not to say they have not monitored safety. They have.\" She directed us to two blog posts she wrote about the case. In the first, she notes that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires HHS to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On June 27, 2018, the agency responded to the request by saying that its search for records \"did not locate any records responsive to your request.\" Reiss then details the \"abundant research\" on HHS and vaccine safety, including Institute of Medicine reports that the agency commissions. \"In July 2014, a large report on vaccine safety commissioned by HHS was also completed.\" She concludes by saying that though HHS \"has done and continued to do abundant work related to vaccines safety, the agency should have submitted the required reports.\" }}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref

| p=1 | q=ICAN is now the best-funded among a trio of organizations that have amplified concerns about vaccines. ICAN brought in $1.4 million in revenue in 2017, with just over $1 million supplied by the Selz Foundation, according to tax filings.}} Founded in 2016 by [[Del Bigtree]], it spreads myths about the risks of vaccines and contributes to [[vaccine hesitancy]],{{R|selz}}{{R|adv}}{{R|rolling}} which has been identified by the [[World Health Organization]] as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019.{{R|v1}}{{R|v2}} \n\n==Funding and activities==\n\nICAN was founded in 2016 by television producer Del Bigtree, after the release of the movie ''[[Vaxxed]]: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe'', which he wrote and produced, with anti-vaccination activist [[Andrew Wakefield]] directing. The national attention Bigtree gained with the movie and its promotion tour allowed the newly-formed group to quickly assume a leading role among the anti-vaccination movement.{{R|selz}}{{R|CWeeks}}{{R|Jez}} Scientists have countered many of ICAN's statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.{{R|v3}}{{R|v4}}{{R|v5}}{{R|v6}}\n\nICAN was established with a $100,000 grant from the Selz Foundation. Its budget ballooned to $1.4 million in 2017, with one million coming from the Selz Foundation, making ICAN the most well-funded anti-vaccination group in the United States that year.{{R|NBC}} ICAN pays a salary of $146,000 to Del Bigtree as its CEO and $98,000 to its Chief Administrative Officer Catharine Layton.{{R|selz}} An article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' states that Layton stumbled upon the anti-vaccine movement on social media after her two sons were diagnosed with autism.{{R|rolling|p=1|q=Layton says her two sons received autism diagnoses after receiving the MMR and pneumonia booster vaccines, respectively; she stumbled on the anti-vaxx community on social media while doing research, and she says that one of her sons has since recovered. }}\n\nIn 2019, Bigtree was a keynote speaker at several anti-vaccination events targeting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn and in Rockland County.{{R|selz}}{{R|ArsT}} He has been criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] for wearing a [[Star of David]] at an anti-vaccination event, attempting to compare the treatment of those opposed to vaccination with the [[Yellow badge|persecution of the Jewish people]].{{R|jta}}{{R|th}}{{R|jos}}{{R|Denton}} Bigtree's anti-vaccine advocacy has been described by anti-vaccination movement critic [[physician]] [[David Gorski]] as \"fear mongering based on misinformation\".{{R|Gorski}}\n\n==Access to information lawsuit==\n\nIn 2018, ICAN filed [[Freedom of information]] lawsuits to force the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]] to release administrative reports on childhood vaccine injury HHS is required to file with Congress. HHS replied that that they could not find any such reports.{{R|selz | p=1 | q=In 2018, the organization filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services. The suits sought to compel the release of data and documents related to vaccine safety. }}{{R|factcheck | p=1 | q=The claim, Reiss said, stems from a public information request filed by the Informed Consent Action Network seeking administrative reports that HHS had filed with Congress. Though the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires HHS to file such reports, HHS said they couldn&apos;t find any in a search.}}\n\nWhile ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines,{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=In a July 2018 post on its website, the Informed Consent Action Network says, \"HHS has not acted in its duties regarding vaccine safety, forcing 78 million American children into a vaccine program with no safety provisions.\"}}\nscientists and the fact-checking site [[Politifact]] pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports.{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=However, Reiss said, while HHS said they couldn\u2019t find the reports the Informed Consent Action Network requested, \"that is not to say they have not monitored safety. They have.\" She directed us to two blog posts she wrote about the case. In the first, she notes that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires HHS to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On June 27, 2018, the agency responded to the request by saying that its search for records \"did not locate any records responsive to your request.\" Reiss then details the \"abundant research\" on HHS and vaccine safety, including Institute of Medicine reports that the agency commissions. \"In July 2014, a large report on vaccine safety commissioned by HHS was also completed.\" She concludes by saying that though HHS \"has done and continued to do abundant work related to vaccines safety, the agency should have submitted the required reports.\" }}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref
