Two books written by Eden and Cedar Paul, ''Creative Revolution'' (1920) and ''Proletcult'' (1921), attracted criticism for their obscure vocabulary - they coined words like 'ergatocracy' to replace the ugly 'dictatorship of the proletariat' - and generally school marmish tone<ref>Stuart MacIntyre, quoted in Wrigley, ''A. J. P. Tayor''.</ref>}}\n\nCedar and Eden Paul were extraordinarily prolific translators in the interwar years, translating a range of [[socialist]] and [[psychotherapeutic|psychotherapy]] works, as well as novels, particularly [[historical novels]]. They were the official translators for [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Emil Ludwig]], and their translations from [[German language|German]] also included works by [[Karl Marx]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Rudolf Brunngraber]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Heinrich von Treitschke]]. However, they also translated work from [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] (including a work by [[Robert Michels]]) and [[Russian language|Russian]] (including works by [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Georgi Plekhanov]], and [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'').\n\nAfter Eden Paul's death in 1944, Cedar Paul published only a small number of translations under her own name.

When an American [[submarine]] sinks in the Caribbean, the U.S. search and recovery team works with an [[oil platform]] crew, racing against Soviet vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected. The film was released on August 9, 1989, receiving generally positive reviews and grossed $89.8 million. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for three more Academy awards.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1994, the U.S. {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}} USS ''Montana'' has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the [[Cayman Trough]]. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team to ''Deep Core'', a privately owned experimental underwater [[drilling platform]] near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman being the current foreman.\n\nDuring initial investigation of the ''Montana'', a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without ''Deep Core''{{'}}s permission to recover a [[Trident (missile)|Trident missile]] warhead from the ''Montana'' just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging the ''Deep Core'' to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\n\nThe crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]], the crew spies on him through a [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remote operated vehicle]], finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer [[CPR]] and revive her.\n\nOne SEAL, Ensign Monk, helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a [[liquid breathing]] apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien ship deep in the trench. Inside the ship, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.\n\nOn ''Deep Core'' the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with ''Deep Core'' and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of ''Deep Core'' exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from [[decompression sickness]]. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\n===Special Edition===\nIn the [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended version]], the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the ''Montana'' additionally fuels the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regard to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive [[megatsunami]]s that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans and they show Bud his message to Lindsey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband.\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife.\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* [[J.C.

The basic idea did not change, but many of the details were modified over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} While making ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Cameron saw a ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=106}} He and producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] decided that ''The Abyss'' would be their next film.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Cameron and Hurd were married before ''The Abyss'', separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.<ref name=\"Harmetz\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title=A Foray into Deep Waters |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=15 |date=August 6, 1989 |accessdate=2009-08-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027195842/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |df=}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the [[Cayman Islands]].{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}} This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}}\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the [[Bahamas]] where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} He considered shooting the film in [[Malta]], which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=106}} Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the [[Earl Owensby Studios|Gaffney Studios]], situated south of [[Cherokee Falls, South Carolina|Cherokee Falls]], outside [[Gaffney, South Carolina]], which had been abandoned by [[Duke Power]] officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the [[Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant]], along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}}\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held {{convert|7.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held {{convert|2.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in [[saturation diving]] systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}}\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world\u2014a mine in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri]], which was the background for several underwater shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |title=Bonne Terre Mine Tour |work=bonneterrebiz.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528182328/http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |archivedate=2013-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryhomesofmissouri.com/city/detail/?id=2680 |title=City Data for Bonne Terre, Missouri |work=CountryHomesofMissouri.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071621/http://www.countryhomesofmissouri.com/city/detail/?id=2680 |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and {{convert|150,000|USgal|m3}} of water a minute rushed out.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nCameron's cinematographer, [[Mikael Salomon]], used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous [[tarpaulin]].{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nThe [[liquid breathing|breathing fluid]] used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.<ref name=\"Kylstra\"/> Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nEd Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ''ever'' want to go through this again\".{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting ''The Abyss'' has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}} A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}}\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene\u2014in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest\u2014the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibberd |first=James |title=Ed Harris discusses his 9 best movie roles |date=29 November 2016 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/29/ed-harris-movies/ |accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\"<ref name=\"McLean\"/> Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\"<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> However, after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, \"''The Abyss'' was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/trivia_abyss.htm |title=The Abyss Movie Trivia  |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017134303/http://www.fast-rewind.com/trivia_abyss.htm |archivedate=2013-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nTo create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered [[Traditional animation#cels|cel animation]] or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. [[Phil Tippett]] suggested Cameron contact [[Industrial Light & Magic]].{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#The Secret Lab|Dream Quest Images]] and computer graphics and opticals by ILM.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director [[Wes Takahashi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html |title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi |website=Animators' Hall of Fame |access-date=14 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812020742/http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html |archivedate=12 August 2016}}</ref> the technology they used for the cgi was [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].\n\nStudio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot.

As chronicled in the 1993 [[LaserDisc]] Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the \"Scenes I liked most\" and \"Scenes I liked least\" fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long as the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"<ref>''The Abyss Special Edition DVD, The Restoration''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of ''Terminator''. On ''Aliens'', we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n\nThe sense of something being missing on ''Aliens'' was greater for me than on ''The Abyss'', where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite magazine |title=James Cameron: Filmmaker Under Pressure |last=Spelling |first=Ian |date=January 1990 |magazine=[[Starlog]] |issue=150}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:8.23.12BiehnBlancByLuigiNovi17.jpg|thumb|Star [[Michael Biehn]] signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an August 23, 2012, appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\nCameron elected to remove the sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\nStar Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"<ref name=\"starlog\" />\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of ''The Abyss'' for their own use that incorporated [[dailies]]. With the tremendous success of Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' in 1991, [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/movies/fox-locks-in-cameron-with-a-5-year-deal-worth-500-million.html |title=Fox Locks In Cameron With a 5-Year Deal Worth $500 Million |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=April 22, 1992 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref> The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete ''The Abyss''.<ref>''The Toronto Star'', ''Starweek Magazine''</ref> ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\nThe [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] tools developed for ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' allowed ILM to complete the rumored [[tsunami|tidal wave]] sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit ''The Abyss'', ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator [[William Wisher Jr.|William Wisher]] had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] who catches the first tidal wave on camera.\n\nWhen it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new [[dialogue]] and [[Foley artist|foley]] were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died of a self-inflicted gunshot<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19900524&id=wg8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-BMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5946,3479841 |title=Kidd Brewer Jr. found dead at home |date=May 24, 1990 |newspaper=[[Wilmington Morning Star]] |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref> before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the [[dailies]]. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.\n\nAs [[Alan Silvestri]] was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on February 26, 1993, and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks.

When an American [[submarine]] sinks in the Caribbean, the U.S. search and recovery team works with an [[oil platform]] crew, racing against Soviet vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected. The film was released on August 9, 1989, receiving generally positive reviews and grossed $89.8 million. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for three more Academy awards.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1994, the U.S. {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}} USS ''Montana'' has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the [[Cayman Trough]]. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team to ''Deep Core'', a privately owned experimental underwater [[drilling platform]] near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman being the current foreman.\n\nDuring initial investigation of the ''Montana'', a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without ''Deep Core''{{'}}s permission to recover a [[Trident (missile)|Trident missile]] warhead from the ''Montana'' just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging the ''Deep Core'' to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\n\nThe crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]], the crew spies on him through a [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remote operated vehicle]], finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer [[CPR]] and revive her.\n\nOne SEAL, Ensign Monk, helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a [[liquid breathing]] apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien ship deep in the trench. Inside the ship, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.\n\nOn ''Deep Core'' the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with ''Deep Core'' and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of ''Deep Core'' exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from [[decompression sickness]]. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\n===Special Edition===\nIn the [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended version]], the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the ''Montana'' additionally fuels the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regard to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive [[megatsunami]]s that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans and they show Bud his message to Lindsey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband.\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife.\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* [[J.C.

The basic idea did not change, but many of the details were modified over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} While making ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Cameron saw a ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}}\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the [[Bahamas]] where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} He considered shooting the film in [[Malta]], which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=106}} Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the [[Earl Owensby Studios|Gaffney Studios]], situated south of [[Cherokee Falls, South Carolina|Cherokee Falls]], outside [[Gaffney, South Carolina]], which had been abandoned by [[Duke Power]] officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the [[Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant]], along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}}\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held {{convert|7.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held {{convert|2.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=39}} As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in [[saturation diving]] systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}}\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world\u2014a mine in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri]], which was the background for several underwater shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |title=Bonne Terre Mine Tour |work=bonneterrebiz.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528182328/http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/ |archivedate=2013-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryhomesofmissouri.com/city/detail/?id=2680 |title=City Data for Bonne Terre, Missouri |work=CountryHomesofMissouri.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071621/http://www.countryhomesofmissouri.com/city/detail/?id=2680 |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and {{convert|150,000|USgal|m3}} of water a minute rushed out.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nCameron's cinematographer, [[Mikael Salomon]], used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous [[tarpaulin]].{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}} Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=58}}\n\nThe [[liquid breathing|breathing fluid]] used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.<ref name=\"Kylstra\"/> Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nEd Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/>\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ''ever'' want to go through this again\".{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=40}} For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting ''The Abyss'' has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"{{sfnp|Blair|1989|p=38}} A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=107}} Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}}\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p=108}} While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene\u2014in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest\u2014the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibberd |first=James |title=Ed Harris discusses his 9 best movie roles |date=29 November 2016 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/29/ed-harris-movies/ |accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.<ref name=\"Harmetz\"/> He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls.

As chronicled in the 1993 [[LaserDisc]] Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the \"Scenes I liked most\" and \"Scenes I liked least\" fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long as the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"<ref>''The Abyss Special Edition DVD, The Restoration''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of ''Terminator''. On ''Aliens'', we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n\nThe sense of something being missing on ''Aliens'' was greater for me than on ''The Abyss'', where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite magazine |title=James Cameron: Filmmaker Under Pressure |last=Spelling |first=Ian |date=January 1990 |magazine=[[Starlog]] |issue=150}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:8.23.12BiehnBlancByLuigiNovi17.jpg|thumb|Star [[Michael Biehn]] signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an August 23, 2012, appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\nCameron elected to remove the sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\nStar Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"<ref name=\"starlog\" />\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of ''The Abyss'' for their own use that incorporated [[dailies]]. With the tremendous success of Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' in 1991, [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/movies/fox-locks-in-cameron-with-a-5-year-deal-worth-500-million.html |title=Fox Locks In Cameron With a 5-Year Deal Worth $500 Million |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=April 22, 1992 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref> The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete ''The Abyss''.<ref>''The Toronto Star'', ''Starweek Magazine''</ref> ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\nThe [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] tools developed for ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' allowed ILM to complete the rumored [[tsunami|tidal wave]] sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit ''The Abyss'', ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator [[William Wisher Jr.|William Wisher]] had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] who catches the first tidal wave on camera.\n\nWhen it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new [[dialogue]] and [[Foley artist|foley]] were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died of a self-inflicted gunshot<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19900524&id=wg8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-BMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5946,3479841 |title=Kidd Brewer Jr. found dead at home |date=May 24, 1990 |newspaper=[[Wilmington Morning Star]] |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref> before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the [[dailies]]. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.\n\nAs [[Alan Silvestri]] was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on February 26, 1993, and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks.

Please do not alter this without providing a more reliable source --> \nwho signed and printed his name '''Wm. Lloyd Garrison''', was a prominent American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], journalist, [[suffragist]], and social reformer. He is best known for his widely-read anti-slavery newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', which he founded in 1831 and published in Boston until [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|slavery in the United States was abolished by Constitutional amendment in 1865]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and promoted immediate, as opposed to gradual, emancipation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]].\n\n\"The source of Garrison's power was the Bible. From his earliest days he read the Bible constantly, and prayed constantly. It was with this fire that he started his conflagration. ...So also, a prejudice against all fixed forms of worship, against the authority of human government, against every binding of the spirit into conformity with human law, \u2014 all these things grew up in Garrison's mind out of his Bible reading.\"<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|164, 166}}\n\nGarrison was not an abolitionist who became a publisher, but a printer who became an abolitionist. Garrison was a typesetter and could run a printing shop; he wrote his editorials in [[The Liberator (newspaper)|''The Liberator'']] while setting them in type, without first writing them out on paper.<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|57}} This helped assure the viability of ''The Liberator'', and also that it contained exactly what Garrison wanted, as he did not have to deal with any outsiders to produce his paper, except his partner Knapp, with whom he eventually had a falling-out. Like the other major abolitionist printer-publisher, the martyred [[Elijah Lovejoy]], a price was on his head; he was burned in effigy and a gallows was erected in front of his Boston office. and while he was relatively safe in Boston, at one point he had to be smuggled onto a ship to escape to England, where he remained for a year. \n\n{{quote|From the day Garrison established the ''Liberator'' he was the strongest man in America. He was affected in his thought by no one. What he was thinking, all men were destined to think. ...His power of arousing uncontrollable disgust was a gift, like magic; and he seems to sail upon it as a demon upon the wind. Not [[Andrew Jackson]], nor [[John Quincy Adams]], nor [[Noah Webster|Webster]], nor [[Henry Clay|Clay]], nor [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]], nor [[John C.

In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison by Southworth and Hawes, c1850.png|upright|thumb|left|Garrison circa 1850]]\nGarrison was born on December 10, 1805, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 53. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> the son of immigrants from the British colony of [[New Brunswick]], in present-day Canada. Under [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], Abijah Garrison, a merchant sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807]], intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. The elder Garrison became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison's mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name; he later printed his name as \"Wm. Lloyd\". She died in 1823, in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref>Henry Mayer, \"All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery\", (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998), 32.</ref>\n\nGarrison sold home-made lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym ''[[Aristides]].'' (Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general, nicknamed \"the Just\".) After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison became the sole owner, editor, and printer of the ''Newburyport Free Press,'' acquiring the rights from his friend [[Isaac Knapp]], who had also apprenticed at the ''Herald''. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. In this early work as a small-town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally-known writer, speaker, and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the ''National Philanthropist'' in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the first American journal to promote legally-mandated [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]].\n\nGarrison began his newspaper career as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the [[American Colonization Society]] and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded ''The Liberator'' to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized out of its readers the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]]. This society expanded into the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished.\n\n==Career==\n{{Slavery}}\n\n===Reformer===\nAt the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|Reverend John Rankin]], ''Letters on Slavery'', for attracting him to the cause.<ref>Hagedorn, p.&nbsp;58</ref> For a brief time he became associated with the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization that promoted the \"resettlement\" of free blacks to a territory (now known as [[Liberia]]) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829\u20131830, \"Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William E.|last=Cain|title=William Lloyd Garrison and the fight against Slavery: Selections from the Liberatoa}}</ref>\n\n===''Genius of Universal Emancipation''===\nIn 1829, Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with [[Benjamin Lundy]] of the [[Quaker]] newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', published in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other production issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the ''Genius'', he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.\n\nGarrison introduced \"The Black List,\" a column devoted to printing short reports of \"the barbarities of slavery\u2014kidnappings, whippings, murders.\"<ref>Thomas, 119</ref> For instance, Garrison reported that [[Francis Todd]], a shipper from Garrison's home town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], was involved in the domestic [[slave trade]], and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to [[New Orleans]] in the [[coastwise trade]] on his ship the ''Francis''. (This was completely legal. An expanded domestic trade, \"breeding\" slaves in Maryland and Virginia for shipment south, replaced the importation of African slaves, prohibited in 1808; see [[Slavery in the United States#Slave trade]].)\n\nTodd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges{{what|date=December 2019}} against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis|title=1831, Year of Eclipse|url=https://archive.org/details/1831yearofeclips00masu|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|edition=7th}}</ref> He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist [[Arthur Tappan]] paid his fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably parted ways.\n\n===Against \"colonization\"===\nFrom the eighteenth century there had been proposals to return slaves to Africa, considered as if it were a single country and ethnicity, where the slaves presumably \"wanted to go back to\". The U. S. Congress appropriated money, and a variety of churches and philanthropic organizations contributed to the endeavor. Slaves set free in the District of Columbia in 1862 were offered $100 if they would emigrate to Haiti or Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] eventually succeeded in creating the \"colony\", then country, of [[Liberia]]. The legal status of Liberia prior to its independence was never clarified; it was not a colony in the sense that Rhode Island or Pennsylvania had been colonies. When Liberia declared its independence in 1847, no country recognized it at first. Recognition by the United States was impeded by the Southerners who controlled Congress. When they departed ''en masse'' for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]],  recognition quickly followed (1862), just as slavery was prohibited in the District of Columbia at almost the same time\u2014another measure, discussed for decades, that the Southern contingent had blocked.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1831, Garrison, fully aware of the press as a means to bring about political change,<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Press\n|first=Marcy J.\n|last=Dinius\n|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/322\n|journal=[[Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]\n|volume=16\n|number=4\n|year=2018\n|pages=747-755\n|via=[[Project MUSE]]\n|doi=10.1353/eam.2018.0045}}</ref>{{rp|750}} returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', with his friend [[Isaac Knapp]].<ref>{{citation |title=Boston Directory |year=1831 |url=https://archive.org/stream/stimpsonsbostond3132adam#page/4/mode/1up |quote=Garrison & Knapp, editors and proprietors Liberator, 10 Merchants Hall, Congress Street }}</ref> In the first issue, Garrison stated:\n\n{{quote|In Park-Street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, I unreflectingly assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.

A similar recantation, from my pen, was published in the ''Genius of Universal Emancipation'' at Baltimore, in September, 1829.  My conscience is now satisfied.\n\nI am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No!

In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials. Although Garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. [[Nat Turner]]'s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after ''The Liberator'' started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p1vc3b1/William-Lloyd-Garrison-and-The-Liberator-In-the-30-years-before-the-American/|title=William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator In the 30 years before the American|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/x_p5ntprhbyf/william-lloyd-garrison/|title=William Lloyd Garrison|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAmong the anti-slavery essays and poems which Garrison published in ''The Liberator'' was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]].\n\n''The Liberator'' gradually gained a large following in the Northern states. It printed or reprinted many reports, letters, and news stories, serving as a type of [[community bulletin board]] for the abolition movement. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. It was received in state legislatures, governor's mansions, Congress, and the White House. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a \"Valedictory\" column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The object for which the ''Liberator'' was commenced\u2014the extermination of chattel slavery\u2014having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,) under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with millions instead of hundreds for allies.<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1865/12/29/valedictory Valedictory (1865-12-29): by William Lloyd Garrison<!-- Bot generated title -->]. The first part of the column included the following: \"Commencing my editorial career when only twenty years of age, I have followed it continuously till I have attained my sixtieth year\u2014first, in connection with ''The Free Press'', in Newburyport, in the spring of 1826; next, with ''The National Philanthropist'', in Boston, in 1827; next, with ''The Journal of the Times'', in Bennington, Vt., in 1828\u201329; next, with ''[[The Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', in Baltimore, in 1829\u201330; and, finally, with the ''Liberator'', in Boston, from January 1, 1831, to January 1, 1866;\u2014at the start, probably the youngest member of the editorial fraternity in the land, now, perhaps, the oldest, not in years, but in continuous service,\u2014unless [[William Cullen Bryant|Mr. Bryant]], of the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']], be an exception. ...\"</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Helen Eliza Benson Garrison.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of Garrison's wife, Helen Eliza Benson]]\n\n===Garrison and Knapp, printers and publishers===\nSee [[List of publications of William Garrison and Isaac Knapp]].\n\n===Organization and reaction===\nIn addition to publishing ''The Liberator'', Garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]] which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AAS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison's appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the [[Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which raised funds to support ''The Liberator'', publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.\n\nThe purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that \"Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God\" and that \"duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its ''immediate abandonment'' without expatriation.\"<ref>Quoted in: Clifton E. Olmstead (1960): ''History of Religion in the United States''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 369</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811\u20131876), the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. The couple had five sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter died as children.\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|William Lloyd Garrison, engraving from 1879 newspaper]]\n\nThe threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, \"dead or alive\".<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage. The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0195140737}}, p. 263.</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 1835, \"an assemblage of fifteen hundred or two thousand highly respectable gentlemen\", as they were described in the ''[[Boston Commercial Gazette]]'', surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor [[Theodore Lyman (militiaman)|Theodore Lyman]] persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone.<ref>Mayer, 201\u201304</ref> The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards [[Boston Common]], calling for [[tar and feathers]].

In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters [[Angelina Grimk\u00e9]] and [[Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on woman's rights\u2014Angelina's \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/letterstocather00beecgoog \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref> and Sarah's \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lettersonequali00grimgoog \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref>\u2014and Garrison published them first in ''The Liberator'' and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the \"woman question,\" Garrison announced in December 1837 that ''The Liberator'' would support \"the rights of woman to their utmost extent.\" The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.\n\nIn 1840, Garrison's promotion of woman's rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]], to leave the AAS and form the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] meeting in London refused to seat America's women delegates, Garrison, [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel P. Rogers]], and William Adams<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seldon|first1=Horace|title=The 'Women's Question' and Garrison|url=http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/the-woman-question-and-garrison/|website=The liberator files|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> refused to take their seat as delegates as well, and joined the women in the spectator's gallery. The controversy introduced the woman's rights question not only to England, but also to future woman's rights leader [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who attended the convention as a spectator, accompanying her delegate-husband, [[Henry B. Stanton]].\n\nAlthough Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans' failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AAS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison's influence \u2014 those who disagreed with Garrison's insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists, including Stanton, [[Gerrit Smith]], [[Charles Turner Torrey]], and [[Amos A. Phelps]], wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AAS in 1840, formed the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and nominated [[James G. Birney]] for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough some members of the Liberty Party supported woman's rights, including [[women's suffrage]], Garrison's ''Liberator'' continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports, and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal.<ref>\"Women's Rights Convention,\" ''Liberator'', June 7, 1850</ref> At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.<ref>Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 104, 109, 293 note 26.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston's most notable trials of the time. [[Washington Goode]], a black seaman, had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In ''The Liberator'' Garrison argued that the verdict relied on \"circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character&nbsp;...\" and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race. As all other death sentences since 1836 in Boston had been commuted, Garrison concluded that Goode would be the last person executed in Boston for a capital offense writing, \"Let it not be said that the last man Massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man!\"<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Shall He Be Hung?\n|first=William Lloyd\n|last=Garrison\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|date=March 30, 1849\n|page=2\n|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34644555/washington_goode_shall_he_be_hung/\n|via=newspapers.com}}</ref> Despite the efforts of Garrison and many other prominent figures of the time, Goode was hanged on May 25, 1849.\n\nGarrison became famous as one of the most articulate, as well as most radical, opponents of slavery. His approach to emancipation stressed \"moral suasion,\" non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves.\" On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as \"a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,\" referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.<ref>''Boston Daily Atlas'', July 6, 1854, Issue 4; col D.(Accessed via Infortrac on 9/5/2012)</ref> In 1855, his eight-year alliance with [[Frederick Douglass]] disintegrated when Douglass converted to the political abolitionists' view that the Constitution could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.{{explain|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Garrison Thompson Phillips ca1850 bySouthworth and Hawes Beinecke2588592456.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrison and fellow abolitionists [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], seated at table, [[daguerreotype]], c. 1850\u20131851]]\nGarrison's outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger.

The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend [[Wendell Phillips]], who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118\u201348. Declaring that his \"vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended,\" Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to [[Boston]], he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of ''The Liberator'' at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granted voting rights to black men. (According to [[Henry Mayer (historian)|Henry Mayer]], Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; \"as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was ''not'' going to the next set of [AAS] meetings\" [594].){{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Lloyd Garrison dinner bill of fair.JPG|thumb|upright|Dinner bill of fare for Lloyd Garrison, Franklin Club, [[Young's Hotel (Boston)|Young's Hotel]], Boston, October 14, 1878.]]\nAfter his withdrawal from AAS and ending ''The Liberator'', Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements. He supported the causes of [[civil rights]] for [[African American|blacks]] and woman's rights, particularly the campaign for suffrage. He contributed columns on [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and civil rights for ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 211017}}\n\nIn 1870, he became an associate editor of the women's suffrage newspaper, the ''Woman's Journal'', along with [[Mary Livermore]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry B.

He wrote weekly letters to his children and cared for his increasingly ill wife, Helen. She had suffered a small stroke on December 30, 1863, and was increasingly confined to the house. Helen died on January 25, 1876, after a severe cold worsened into [[pneumonia]]. A quiet funeral was held in the Garrison home. Garrison, overcome with grief and confined to his bedroom with a fever and severe [[bronchitis]], was unable to join the service. [[Wendell Phillips]] gave a eulogy and many of Garrison's old abolitionist friends joined him upstairs to offer their private condolences.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nGarrison recovered slowly from the loss of his wife and began to attend [[Spiritualist]] circles in the hope of communicating with Helen.<ref>Mayer, 621</ref> Garrison last visited England in 1877, where he met with [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and other longtime friends from the British abolitionist movement.<ref>Mayer, 622</ref>\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrisonGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of William Lloyd Garrison]]\n\nSuffering from kidney disease, Garrison continued to weaken during April 1879. He moved to New York to live with his daughter Fanny's family. In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him. Fanny asked if he would enjoy singing some hymns. Although he was unable to sing, his children sang favorite hymns while he beat time with his hands and feet. On May 24, 1879, Garrison lost consciousness and died just before midnight.<ref>Mayer, 626</ref>\n\nGarrison was buried in the [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in Boston's [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood on May 28, 1879.

His second son, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]] (1840\u20131907), was literary editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1865 to 1906. Two other sons (George Thompson Garrison and Francis Jackson Garrison, his biographer and named after abolitionist [[Francis Jackson (abolitionist)|Francis Jackson]]) and a daughter, [[Fanny Garrison Villard|Helen Frances Garrison]] (who married [[Henry Villard]]), survived him.

Lloyd Garrison''', was a prominent American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], journalist, [[suffragist]], and social reformer. He is best known for his widely-read anti-slavery newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', which he founded in 1831 and published in Boston until [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|slavery in the United States was abolished by Constitutional amendment in 1865]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and promoted immediate, as opposed to gradual, emancipation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]].\n\n\"The source of Garrison's power was the Bible. From his earliest days he read the Bible constantly, and prayed constantly. It was with this fire that he started his conflagration. ...So also, a prejudice against all fixed forms of worship, against the authority of human government, against every binding of the spirit into conformity with human law, \u2014 all these things grew up in Garrison's mind out of his Bible reading.\"<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|164, 166}}\n\nGarrison was not an abolitionist who became a publisher, but a printer who became an abolitionist. Garrison was a typesetter and could run a printing shop; he wrote his editorials in [[The Liberator (newspaper)|''The Liberator'']] while setting them in type, without first writing them out on paper.<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|57}} This helped assure the viability of ''The Liberator'', and also that it contained exactly what Garrison wanted, as he did not have to deal with any outsiders to produce his paper, except his partner Knapp, with whom he eventually had a falling-out. Like the other major abolitionist printer-publisher, the martyred [[Elijah Lovejoy]], a price was on his head; he was burned in effigy and a gallows was erected in front of his Boston office. and while he was relatively safe in Boston, at one point he had to be smuggled onto a ship to escape to England, where he remained for a year. \n\n{{quote|From the day Garrison established the ''Liberator'' he was the strongest man in America. He was affected in his thought by no one. What he was thinking, all men were destined to think. ...His power of arousing uncontrollable disgust was a gift, like magic; and he seems to sail upon it as a demon upon the wind. Not [[Andrew Jackson]], nor [[John Quincy Adams]], nor [[Noah Webster|Webster]], nor [[Henry Clay|Clay]], nor [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]], nor [[John C.

In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison by Southworth and Hawes, c1850.png|upright|thumb|left|Garrison circa 1850]]\nGarrison was born on December 10, 1805, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 53. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> the son of immigrants from the British colony of [[New Brunswick]], in present-day Canada. Under [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], Abijah Garrison, a merchant sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807]], intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. The elder Garrison became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison's mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name; he later printed his name as \"Wm. Lloyd\". She died in 1823, in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref>Henry Mayer, \"All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery\", (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998), 32.</ref>\n\nGarrison sold home-made lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym ''[[Aristides]].'' (Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general, nicknamed \"the Just\".) After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison became the sole owner, editor, and printer of the ''Newburyport Free Press,'' acquiring the rights from his friend [[Isaac Knapp]], who had also apprenticed at the ''Herald''. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. In this early work as a small-town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally-known writer, speaker, and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the ''National Philanthropist'' in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the first American journal to promote legally-mandated [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]].\n\nGarrison began his newspaper career as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the [[American Colonization Society]] and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded ''The Liberator'' to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized out of its readers the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]]. This society expanded into the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished.\n\n==Career==\n{{Slavery}}\n\n===Reformer===\nAt the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|Reverend John Rankin]], ''Letters on Slavery'', for attracting him to the cause.<ref>Hagedorn, p.&nbsp;58</ref> For a brief time he became associated with the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization that promoted the \"resettlement\" of free blacks to a territory (now known as [[Liberia]]) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829\u20131830, \"Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William E.|last=Cain|title=William Lloyd Garrison and the fight against Slavery: Selections from the Liberatoa}}</ref>\n\n===''Genius of Universal Emancipation''===\nIn 1829, Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with [[Benjamin Lundy]] of the [[Quaker]] newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', published in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other production issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the ''Genius'', he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.\n\nGarrison introduced \"The Black List,\" a column devoted to printing short reports of \"the barbarities of slavery\u2014kidnappings, whippings, murders.\"<ref>Thomas, 119</ref> For instance, Garrison reported that [[Francis Todd]], a shipper from Garrison's home town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], was involved in the domestic [[slave trade]], and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to [[New Orleans]] in the [[coastwise trade]] on his ship the ''Francis''. (This was completely legal. An expanded domestic trade, \"breeding\" slaves in Maryland and Virginia for shipment south, replaced the importation of African slaves, prohibited in 1808; see [[Slavery in the United States#Slave trade]].)\n\nTodd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges{{what|date=December 2019}} against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis|title=1831, Year of Eclipse|url=https://archive.org/details/1831yearofeclips00masu|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|edition=7th}}</ref> He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist [[Arthur Tappan]] paid his fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably parted ways.\n\n===Against \"colonization\"===\nFrom the eighteenth century there had been proposals to return slaves to Africa, considered as if it were a single country and ethnicity, where the slaves presumably \"wanted to go back to\". The U. S. Congress appropriated money, and a variety of churches and philanthropic organizations contributed to the endeavor. Slaves set free in the District of Columbia in 1862 were offered $100 if they would emigrate to Haiti or Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] eventually succeeded in creating the \"colony\", then country, of [[Liberia]]. The legal status of Liberia prior to its independence was never clarified; it was not a colony in the sense that Rhode Island or Pennsylvania had been colonies. When Liberia declared its independence in 1847, no country recognized it at first. Recognition by the United States was impeded by the Southerners who controlled Congress. When they departed ''en masse'' for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]],  recognition quickly followed (1862), just as slavery was prohibited in the District of Columbia at almost the same time\u2014another measure, discussed for decades, that the Southern contingent had blocked.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1831, Garrison, fully aware of the press as a means to bring about political change,<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Press\n|first=Marcy J.\n|last=Dinius\n|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/322\n|journal=[[Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]\n|volume=16\n|number=4\n|year=2018\n|pages=747-755\n|via=[[Project MUSE]]\n|doi=10.1353/eam.2018.0045}}</ref>{{rp|750}} returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', with his friend [[Isaac Knapp]].<ref>{{citation |title=Boston Directory |year=1831 |url=https://archive.org/stream/stimpsonsbostond3132adam#page/4/mode/1up |quote=Garrison & Knapp, editors and proprietors Liberator, 10 Merchants Hall, Congress Street }}</ref> In the first issue, Garrison stated:\n\n{{quote|In Park-Street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, I unreflectingly assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.

A similar recantation, from my pen, was published in the ''Genius of Universal Emancipation'' at Baltimore, in September, 1829.  My conscience is now satisfied.\n\nI am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No!

In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials. Although Garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. [[Nat Turner]]'s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after ''The Liberator'' started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p1vc3b1/William-Lloyd-Garrison-and-The-Liberator-In-the-30-years-before-the-American/|title=William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator In the 30 years before the American|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/x_p5ntprhbyf/william-lloyd-garrison/|title=William Lloyd Garrison|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAmong the anti-slavery essays and poems which Garrison published in ''The Liberator'' was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]].\n\n''The Liberator'' gradually gained a large following in the Northern states. It printed or reprinted many reports, letters, and news stories, serving as a type of [[community bulletin board]] for the abolition movement. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. It was received in state legislatures, governor's mansions, Congress, and the White House. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a \"Valedictory\" column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The object for which the ''Liberator'' was commenced\u2014the extermination of chattel slavery\u2014having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,) under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with millions instead of hundreds for allies.<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1865/12/29/valedictory Valedictory (1865-12-29): by William Lloyd Garrison<!-- Bot generated title -->]. The first part of the column included the following: \"Commencing my editorial career when only twenty years of age, I have followed it continuously till I have attained my sixtieth year\u2014first, in connection with ''The Free Press'', in Newburyport, in the spring of 1826; next, with ''The National Philanthropist'', in Boston, in 1827; next, with ''The Journal of the Times'', in Bennington, Vt., in 1828\u201329; next, with ''[[The Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', in Baltimore, in 1829\u201330; and, finally, with the ''Liberator'', in Boston, from January 1, 1831, to January 1, 1866;\u2014at the start, probably the youngest member of the editorial fraternity in the land, now, perhaps, the oldest, not in years, but in continuous service,\u2014unless [[William Cullen Bryant|Mr. Bryant]], of the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']], be an exception. ...\"</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Helen Eliza Benson Garrison.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of Garrison's wife, Helen Eliza Benson]]\n\n===Garrison and Knapp, printers and publishers===\nSee [[List of publications of William Garrison and Isaac Knapp]].\n\n===Organization and reaction===\nIn addition to publishing ''The Liberator'', Garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]] which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AAS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison's appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the [[Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which raised funds to support ''The Liberator'', publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.\n\nThe purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that \"Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God\" and that \"duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its ''immediate abandonment'' without expatriation.\"<ref>Quoted in: Clifton E. Olmstead (1960): ''History of Religion in the United States''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 369</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811\u20131876), the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. The couple had five sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter died as children.\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|William Lloyd Garrison, engraving from 1879 newspaper]]\n\nThe threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, \"dead or alive\".<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage. The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0195140737}}, p. 263.</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 1835, \"an assemblage of fifteen hundred or two thousand highly respectable gentlemen\", as they were described in the ''[[Boston Commercial Gazette]]'', surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor [[Theodore Lyman (militiaman)|Theodore Lyman]] persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone.<ref>Mayer, 201\u201304</ref> The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards [[Boston Common]], calling for [[tar and feathers]].

In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters [[Angelina Grimk\u00e9]] and [[Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on woman's rights\u2014Angelina's \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/letterstocather00beecgoog \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref> and Sarah's \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lettersonequali00grimgoog \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref>\u2014and Garrison published them first in ''The Liberator'' and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the \"woman question,\" Garrison announced in December 1837 that ''The Liberator'' would support \"the rights of woman to their utmost extent.\" The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.\n\nIn 1840, Garrison's promotion of woman's rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]], to leave the AAS and form the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] meeting in London refused to seat America's women delegates, Garrison, [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel P. Rogers]], and William Adams<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seldon|first1=Horace|title=The 'Women's Question' and Garrison|url=http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/the-woman-question-and-garrison/|website=The liberator files|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> refused to take their seat as delegates as well, and joined the women in the spectator's gallery. The controversy introduced the woman's rights question not only to England, but also to future woman's rights leader [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who attended the convention as a spectator, accompanying her delegate-husband, [[Henry B. Stanton]].\n\nAlthough Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans' failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AAS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison's influence \u2014 those who disagreed with Garrison's insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists, including Stanton, [[Gerrit Smith]], [[Charles Turner Torrey]], and [[Amos A. Phelps]], wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AAS in 1840, formed the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and nominated [[James G. Birney]] for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough some members of the Liberty Party supported woman's rights, including [[women's suffrage]], Garrison's ''Liberator'' continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports, and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal.<ref>\"Women's Rights Convention,\" ''Liberator'', June 7, 1850</ref> At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.<ref>Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 104, 109, 293 note 26.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston's most notable trials of the time. [[Washington Goode]], a black seaman, had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In ''The Liberator'' Garrison argued that the verdict relied on \"circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character&nbsp;...\" and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race. As all other death sentences since 1836 in Boston had been commuted, Garrison concluded that Goode would be the last person executed in Boston for a capital offense writing, \"Let it not be said that the last man Massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man!\"<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Shall He Be Hung?\n|first=William Lloyd\n|last=Garrison\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|date=March 30, 1849\n|page=2\n|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34644555/washington_goode_shall_he_be_hung/\n|via=newspapers.com}}</ref> Despite the efforts of Garrison and many other prominent figures of the time, Goode was hanged on May 25, 1849.\n\nGarrison became famous as one of the most articulate, as well as most radical, opponents of slavery. His approach to emancipation stressed \"moral suasion,\" non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves.\" On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as \"a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,\" referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.<ref>''Boston Daily Atlas'', July 6, 1854, Issue 4; col D.(Accessed via Infortrac on 9/5/2012)</ref> In 1855, his eight-year alliance with [[Frederick Douglass]] disintegrated when Douglass converted to the political abolitionists' view that the Constitution could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.{{explain|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Garrison Thompson Phillips ca1850 bySouthworth and Hawes Beinecke2588592456.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrison and fellow abolitionists [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], seated at table, [[daguerreotype]], c. 1850\u20131851]]\nGarrison's outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger.

The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend [[Wendell Phillips]], who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118\u201348. Declaring that his \"vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended,\" Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to [[Boston]], he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of ''The Liberator'' at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granted voting rights to black men. (According to [[Henry Mayer (historian)|Henry Mayer]], Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; \"as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was ''not'' going to the next set of [AAS] meetings\" [594].){{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Lloyd Garrison dinner bill of fair.JPG|thumb|upright|Dinner bill of fare for Lloyd Garrison, Franklin Club, [[Young's Hotel (Boston)|Young's Hotel]], Boston, October 14, 1878.]]\nAfter his withdrawal from AAS and ending ''The Liberator'', Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements. He supported the causes of [[civil rights]] for [[African American|blacks]] and woman's rights, particularly the campaign for suffrage. He contributed columns on [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and civil rights for ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1870, he became an associate editor of the women's suffrage newspaper, the ''Woman's Journal'', along with [[Mary Livermore]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry B.

He wrote weekly letters to his children and cared for his increasingly ill wife, Helen. She had suffered a small stroke on December 30, 1863, and was increasingly confined to the house. Helen died on January 25, 1876, after a severe cold worsened into [[pneumonia]]. A quiet funeral was held in the Garrison home. Garrison, overcome with grief and confined to his bedroom with a fever and severe [[bronchitis]], was unable to join the service. [[Wendell Phillips]] gave a eulogy and many of Garrison's old abolitionist friends joined him upstairs to offer their private condolences.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nGarrison recovered slowly from the loss of his wife and began to attend [[Spiritualist]] circles in the hope of communicating with Helen.<ref>Mayer, 621</ref> Garrison last visited England in 1877, where he met with [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and other longtime friends from the British abolitionist movement.<ref>Mayer, 622</ref>\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrisonGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of William Lloyd Garrison]]\n\nSuffering from kidney disease, Garrison continued to weaken during April 1879. He moved to New York to live with his daughter Fanny's family. In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him.

His second son, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]] (1840\u20131907), was literary editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1865 to 1906. Two other sons (George Thompson Garrison and Francis Jackson Garrison, his biographer and named after abolitionist [[Francis Jackson (abolitionist)|Francis Jackson]]) and a daughter, [[Fanny Garrison Villard|Helen Frances Garrison]] (who married [[Henry Villard]]), survived him.
