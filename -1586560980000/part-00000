Watson]].<ref name=\"barnes\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Scarlet Street (magazine)|Scarlet Street]]'', Ian Richardson explained:\n\n{{quote|\"That was the fly in our ointment. Initially, an unseen fly. You see, when Sy Weintraub was planning the films, he was unaware that the copyright on the Holmes stories was about to expire in England and he had to go through a great deal of legal negotiations with the Conan Doyle estate in order to gain permission to use them. However, he was totally ignorant of Granada's plans to film a series with Jeremy Brett...Weintraub was furious, because he'd paid a lot of money to get permission from the estate and here was Granada saying, 'Thank you - but we're going to do it.' So Weintraub took them to court. He had a very good case, apparently; but eventually there was an out of court settlement for an extraordinary sum of money - something like two million pounds - which was enough for Weintraub to cover his costs on both The Sign of Four and The Hound of the Baskervilles, and make a profit, too. And so he wrapped the project up.\"<ref name=\"shl\"/>}}\n\nDenholm Elliot was cast as Dr. Mortimer having previously portrayed Stapleton in the [[comedy]] spoof [[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978 film)|version of the Hound]] starring [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]].<ref name=\"barnes\"/> He also appeared with \"Hound\" co-star [[Connie Booth]] in the spoof ''[[The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It]]''.<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Booth herself would later appear in 1987s ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1987 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref name=\"barnes\"/>\n\nA large part of Martin Shaw's American accent was dubbed by another actor in post-production.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ian Richardson]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n*[[Donald Churchill]] as [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John H.

Initially, an unseen fly. You see, when Sy Weintraub was planning the films, he was unaware that the copyright on the Holmes stories was about to expire in England and he had to go through a great deal of legal negotiations with the Conan Doyle estate in order to gain permission to use them. However, he was totally ignorant of Granada's plans to film a series with Jeremy Brett...Weintraub was furious, because he'd paid a lot of money to get permission from the estate and here was Granada saying, 'Thank you - but we're going to do it.' So Weintraub took them to court. He had a very good case, apparently; but eventually there was an out of court settlement for an extraordinary sum of money - something like two million pounds - which was enough for Weintraub to cover his costs on both The Sign of Four and The Hound of the Baskervilles, and make a profit, too.

During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times.

It operates as an independent, nonprofit [[academic organization]] that offers [[field research]] courses (field schools) at various sites around the world.\n\nThe IFR signed an affiliation agreement with [[Connecticut College]] in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Field Schools - Connecticut College, Department of Anthropology|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/anthropology/field-schools/|publisher=Connecticut College}}</ref>  Through this agreement, students receive 8 semester credit units (equivalent to 12 quarter units) for attending any of the field schools offered by the IFR.

The first report alleged that Enmanuel Gomez Choque (a Peruvian archaeologist and the executive director of the Andahuaylas Museum) had sexually harassed students working under his supervision at an archaeological field school led by him and his wife, Danielle Kurin (an anthropological [[bioarchaeologist]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michael-balter.blogspot.com/2020/02/at-uc-santa-barbara-and-in-peru.html|title=Balter's Blog: At UC Santa Barbara and in Peru, an archaeological couple accused of engaging in sexual misconduct and retaliation against victims |last=Balter|first=Michael|date=2020-02-28|website=Balter's Blog|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. The report found that during the 2015 field season, Gomez had: engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with a female student at a dance club, including forcibly kissing her; that he had made inappropriate sexual jokes in front of the students; and that he had engaged in sexually hostile behavior against a female student during a trip to a pilgrimage site. The allegations also included charges that Gomez had tried to get the female students to adopt \"sexy poses\" so that he could photograph them. It is also alleged that Kurin, retaliated against the students who had filed Title IX complaints against Gomez. \n\nOn June 14, 2016, UCSB's Title IX office found, based on the standard of a preponderance of the evidence, that Gomez had sexually harassed students working with the couple at the field school they ran in the Andahuaylas region. On the same day, Kurin was found guilty, under the same burden of proof, of retaliating against students who had filed Title IX complaints against Gomez. She had been placed on administrative leave the previous April, and remained on leave for a total of three years, according to sources inside and outside the UCSB anthropology department.\n\nThe summer 2015 field school which was the subject of the 2016 Title IX investigation, was offered by UCSB. In 2016 Kurin requested that the field school would be offered through IFR. The request was reviewed by the IFR\u2019s executive director, Ran Boytner and the academic board and approved. The course was scheduled to run from Jun 25-Jul 23, 2016 with Dr. Danielle S. Kurin, Mr. Enmanuel Gomez Choque listed as the only instructors. The school was put on the IFR\u2019s website and began accepting students<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810134241/https://ifrglobal.org/programs/south-america/peru-sondor-2016|title=Peru - Sondor - Institute for Field Research Field Schools|date=2016-08-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. At that time UCLA extension was the school of record providing academic credit for IFR field schools. Ten days before the 2016 field school was supposed to start, UCLA extension cancelled the field school. \n\nThe course was once again offered in 2017 and 2018. According to Willeke Wendrich, \"In preparation of IFR's 2017 field school season we asked UCLA and UCSB to give some information on what the reason of the 2016 cancellation was to determine whether IFR would offer the Peru field school. We only received information that this was an 'administrative leave'. We decided after a long discussion to offer the field school (without UCLA extension credit, which was withheld by UCLA for reasons they would not share). During that year two IFR academics visited the site to check on the quality of the living circumstances and the education, as we do with all our field schools from time to time. The reports were good. In 2018 the field school was, therefore, offered again.\"\n\nIt is unclear if IFR officials knew of the 2016 Title IX report or the reasons for why Kurin was placed on administrative leave. Balter\u2019s reporting alleges that the IFR \u201calmost certainly did know about the 2016 Title IX allegations\u201d. Kevin Vaughn, an Andean archaeologist and dean at the [[University of California, Riverside]], was tipped off about the accusations at the time (he was then a dean at UCLA Extension, the agency that abruptly cancelled Kurin\u2019s 2016 field school). In 2018, Kurin was listed as an instructor at two of the IFR\u2019s Peru field schools (Sondor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> and Wari<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>).\n\nThe 2018 field school at Wari, Peru: Multiple incidents of sexual harassment and assault by Gomez<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. The some details of the report and the complaints are listed below: <blockquote>'''Student No. 1''': \"Hi Michael, I've thought a lot about reaching out after I saw your article about Danielle Kurin and Manuel Gomez. I was on their project in Andahuaylas in 2011 and Manuel forcibly kissed me in a club on that trip. There were also several witnesses, whose names I've blurred [on a contemporaneous messenger thread she attached] since I don't know how they feel about being involved.\"\n\n'''Student No. 2''': This student describes going to a club with Gomez and a group of students during the field school in 2017 (the year after the Title IX findings.) \"We were dancing in a group when Enmanuel came over and started dancing with me, pretty close up onto me. I thought he was showing me how to dance a particular dance, but he was way too close and touchy...I felt uncomfortable and asked another woman from the program if I could dance with her because he kept pushing himself at me....The rest of the program I felt very uncomfortable being alone with Enmanuel and and tried to avoid being alone with him as much as possible.\"\n\nThese are just some examples of the kind of behavior which I have tracked between 2011 and 2018, thanks to witnesses who nevertheless fear retaliation by Kurin and want to keep their identities as hidden as possible. But during the 2018 field school, now two years after the Title IX findings, things seem to have hit a new level of misconduct, and some students finally took a stand.\n\n'''Taylor Johnston''' is a student at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta. She told me that early in the 2018 field school, which began in June of that year, she had a lot of contact with Gomez. \"Manuel was always around me and trying to get me alone,\" she recalls. At first she thought it was because she speaks Spanish well, and Gomez speaks English very poorly. About 10 days into the field season, Johnston says, Gomez took a group of students to an archaeological site called Tukri. \"None of us brought alcohol,\" Johnston says, but \"Manuel was pushing that we needed to go into town and buy beer. He was pushing all of us to drink.\" Johnston says that Gomez told them it was disrespectful to refuse, just as he did during the 2015 field season.\n\nJohnston says that they were accompanied by another academic from a university in Peru, and that both of them behaved towards her in ways that were \"totally inappropriate,\" including \"grabbing my ass.\" After they returned to Andahuaylas, Johnston says, Gomez would drunkenly try to get into the house where the students were staying, banging on the door and asking for her early in the morning. After that she began to distance herself from Gomez, she says.\n\nJohnston also told me about a day trip the group took to some nearly ponds, where the students went bathing despite the cold of the Peruvian winter (which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere.) In an incident reminiscent of one described by the 2015 students, Johnston says she was wearing a sweater over her bathing suit to keep warm. \"Take off your sweater, I want to see your body in your bathing suit,\" Johnston recalls Gomez saying.\n\nAfter Johnston began to keep her distance from Gomez, she and other witnesses say, Gomez began to take an interest in another young researcher I will call '''Student No. 3'''. On the night of July 13/14, shortly before the end of the field season, the students and Gomez went out to a club (Kurin normally did not join these outings.) According to several witnesses, Gomez began plying the students with drinks, especially Student No. 3. \"He was bringing us shots every twenty minutes,\" Johnston says. \"He kept pushing them on [Student No. 3.] He was with her all night at the club, dancing with her.\" Suddenly, around 1:30 am, the students realized that Gomez and Student No. 3 were no longer there. They began a frantic search for her, calling Gomez's cell phone and leaving messages but getting no answer.\n\nAt 5:30 am, Gomez returned to the field house with Student No. 3 in a taxi.</blockquote><br />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Archaeological organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|Organizations|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox non-profit\n| name            = Institute for Field Research (IFR)\n| caption         = Institute for Field Research Field Schools Logo\n| type            = Educational [[Public charity#United States|Operating public charity]]\n| founded_date    = 2011\n| location        = 2999 Overland Ave. #103, Los Angeles CA. 90064\n| key_people      = '''Chair of the Board''' <br/>[http://linear-city.com/ Yuval Bar Zemer], <br/> '''Chair of the Academic Board:'' <br/>[http://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/anthony-graesch/ Anthony Graesch],<br/>'''Other Board Members:''' <br/> [http://www.ioa.ucla.edu/people/willeke-z-wendrich/ Willeke Wendrich],<br/>[https://anthropology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/vaughn/index.html Kevin Vaughn], <br/>[http://www.cast.uark.edu/home/about/staff-web-pages/fred-limp.html Fred Limp], <br/>[http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1008060&CFID=778747&CFTOKEN=65405816 Lynn Swartz Dodd], <br/>[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/anthro/people/faculty/ci.delenjason_ci.detail Jason de Leon], <br/>[http://www.emilylindsey.org/ Emily Lindsey], <br/>[http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/A009/barraod/ Barra O'Donnabhain], <br/>[Mallika Sankaran], <br/>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/williams Tim Williams], <br/>[http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Porter/Welcome.html Benjamin Porter], <br/>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~anthro/flad/research.htm Rowan Flad], <br/>[http://www.johngivenlaw.com/index.html John Given], <br/>[https://anthropology.washington.edu/people/julie-k-stein Julie K.

The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of rear quarterlight windows behind the doors. Factory production commenced in October 1998.\n\nEarly TT models received press coverage following a series of high-speed accidents and the related fatalities which occurred at speeds in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} during abrupt lane changes or sharp turns.  Both the coup\u00e9 and roadster variants were [[product recall|recalled]] in late 1999/early 2000, to improve predictability of the car's [[car handling|handling]] at very high speeds.<ref name=carsdesk.com>{{cite web|title=2000 Audi TT Recalls|url=https://carsdesk.com/recalls/2000/audi/tt|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref> Audi's [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) or [[Traction control system|Anti Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] were added, along with\nmodifications to the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension system]].

It was also on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001.

The TT uses a [[transverse engine|transversely]] mounted [[internal combustion engine]], with either [[front-wheel drive]] with '[[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro four-wheel drive]]' available as an option. It was first available with a 1.8-litre [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] [[multi-valve|5-valve]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine in two states of [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]]-rated power outputs; {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engines share the same fundamental design, but the 225&nbsp;PS version features a larger K04 turbocharger (180 PS version came with a smaller K03), an additional [[intercooler]] on the left side (complementing the existing right-side [[intercooler]]), larger 20mm [[Gudgeon pin|wrist-pins]], a dual tailpipe exhaust, [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] with inlet on driver's side, and a few other internals \u2013 designed to accommodate the increase in [[turbocharger#boost|turbo boost]], from roughly {{convert|10|psi|bar|1}} peak, to {{convert|15|psi|bar|1}}. [[Haldex Traction]] enabled [[four-wheel drive]], 'branded' as \"Quattro\" was optional on the 180 engine, and standard on the more powerful 225 version.\n\n[[File:Audi TT 3.2 Roadster - Flickr - The Car Spy (1).jpg|thumb|3.2 L VR6 engine]]\n\nThe original four-cylinder engine range was complemented with a {{cvt|3189|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[VR6 engine]] rated at {{convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] in early 2003, which came as standard with the quattro four-wheel-drive system. In July 2003, a new six-speed [[dual clutch transmission]] \u2013 dubbed the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), which improves acceleration through much-reduced [[shift time]]s, was offered, along with a stiffer suspension.\n\n===TT quattro Sport{{anchor|TTqS}}===\nIn 2005, Audi released the Coup\u00e9-only limited edition (800 sold in the UK, not the 1000 originally planned) {{nowrap|'''Audi TT quattro Sport'''}}<ref name=WCF_qS>{{cite web|title=Audi TT quattro Sport revealed|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10502229479/audi-tt-quattro-sport-revealed|publisher=[[Audi|AUDI AG]]|work=WorldCarFans.com|date=22 February 2005|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> (known as the {{nowrap|'''Audi TT Club Sport'''}} in Europe).

The SUV utilized a hybrid system coupled with the 2.0-litre TFSI Inline-4 engine producing a total of {{cvt|304|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|479|lbft|Nm|0|lk=|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque. The SUV utilises a 6-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid system consists of a {{cvt|40|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the front axle and an {{cvt|85|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the rear axle. In full EV mode, the vehicle uses the rear motor only; Hybrid and Sport modes utilise all three power sources, and all-wheel-drive traction is applied as needed. Performance figures include a {{cvt|0-62|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 5.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of {{cvt|155|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The distinguishing features of the concept include matrix LED headlights and two new assistance systems: One that scans intersections for potentially dangerous situations, and a second that connects to a municipality's traffic-light system in order to recommend a perfect speed to reach the next light when it is green. The interior is relatively close to the TT's with leather upholstery from Italian fashion brand Poltrona Frau and features a high-tech TFT display in front of the driver populated with the information that would normally be projected onto a central, dash-mounted screen\u2014i.e. navigation, entertainment. The trunk of the vehicle contains a 1:8 scale RC car as a souvenir.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/audi-tt-offroad-concept-photos-and-info-news|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/282254/audi-tt-offroad-concept-revealed/|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept revealed|work=caradvice.com.au/}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Audi TT Offroad Concept (22).JPG|Audi TT Off-Road Concept\n</gallery>\n\n==Marketing==\nDue to [[Audi]]'s heavy sponsorship of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the TT S coupe made a cameo in [[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://fourtitude.com/news/Audi_News_1/audi-tts-confirmed-in-avengers-age-of-ultron/|title=Audi TTS in Age of Ultron|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> and a convertible TTS was driven by [[Peter Parker]] in [[Spider-Man: Homecoming]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20170620/RETAIL03/170629980/audi-to-star-in-new-spider-man-movie|title=Audi In Homecoming|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n* Lewandowski, J\u00fcrgen, Staretz, David, V\u00f6lker, Herbert: ''Das TT Buch.''

The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of rear quarterlight windows behind the doors. Factory production commenced in October 1998.\n\nEarly TT models received press coverage following a series of high-speed accidents and the related fatalities which occurred at speeds in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} during abrupt lane changes or sharp turns.  Both the coup\u00e9 and roadster variants were [[product recall|recalled]] in late 1999/early 2000, to improve predictability of the car's [[car handling|handling]] at very high speeds.<ref name=carsdesk.com>{{cite web|title=2000 Audi TT Recalls|url=https://carsdesk.com/recalls/2000/audi/tt|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref> Audi's [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) or [[Traction control system|Anti Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] were added, along with\nmodifications to the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension system]]. All changes were incorporated into subsequent production.\n\nThe Audi TT was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' award for 2000.  It was also on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001. By 2003, Audi had provided a \"face-lift\" to the TT, with a number of small styling and practicality improvements.\n\nProduction of the Audi TT (Type 8N) ended in June 2006.\n\n===Powertrain===\n[[File:Audi TT 8N engine.JPG|thumb|The 1.8 L turbocharged inline-4 engine]]\n\nMechanically, the TT shares an identical [[powertrain]] layout with its related [[list of Volkswagen Group platforms|Volkswagen Group]]-mates. The TT uses a [[transverse engine|transversely]] mounted [[internal combustion engine]], with either [[front-wheel drive]] with '[[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro four-wheel drive]]' available as an option. It was first available with a 1.8-litre [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] [[multi-valve|5-valve]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine in two states of [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]]-rated power outputs; {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engines share the same fundamental design, but the 225&nbsp;PS version features a larger K04 turbocharger (180 PS version came with a smaller K03), an additional [[intercooler]] on the left side (complementing the existing right-side [[intercooler]]), larger 20mm [[Gudgeon pin|wrist-pins]], a dual tailpipe exhaust, [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] with inlet on driver's side, and a few other internals \u2013 designed to accommodate the increase in [[turbocharger#boost|turbo boost]], from roughly {{convert|10|psi|bar|1}} peak, to {{convert|15|psi|bar|1}}. [[Haldex Traction]] enabled [[four-wheel drive]], 'branded' as \"Quattro\" was optional on the 180 engine, and standard on the more powerful 225 version.\n\n[[File:Audi TT 3.2 Roadster - Flickr - The Car Spy (1).jpg|thumb|3.2 L VR6 engine]]\n\nThe original four-cylinder engine range was complemented with a {{cvt|3189|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[VR6 engine]] rated at {{convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] in early 2003, which came as standard with the quattro four-wheel-drive system. In July 2003, a new six-speed [[dual clutch transmission]] \u2013 dubbed the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), which improves acceleration through much-reduced [[shift time]]s, was offered, along with a stiffer suspension.\n\n===TT quattro Sport{{anchor|TTqS}}===\nIn 2005, Audi released the Coup\u00e9-only limited edition (800 sold in the UK, not the 1000 originally planned) {{nowrap|'''Audi TT quattro Sport'''}}<ref name=WCF_qS>{{cite web|title=Audi TT quattro Sport revealed|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10502229479/audi-tt-quattro-sport-revealed|publisher=[[Audi|AUDI AG]]|work=WorldCarFans.com|date=22 February 2005|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> (known as the {{nowrap|'''Audi TT Club Sport'''}} in Europe).

The SUV utilized a hybrid system coupled with the 2.0-litre TFSI Inline-4 engine producing a total of {{cvt|304|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|479|lbft|Nm|0|lk=|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque. The SUV utilises a 6-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid system consists of a {{cvt|40|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the front axle and an {{cvt|85|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the rear axle. In full EV mode, the vehicle uses the rear motor only; Hybrid and Sport modes utilise all three power sources, and all-wheel-drive traction is applied as needed. Performance figures include a {{cvt|0-62|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 5.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of {{cvt|155|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The distinguishing features of the concept include matrix LED headlights and two new assistance systems: One that scans intersections for potentially dangerous situations, and a second that connects to a municipality's traffic-light system in order to recommend a perfect speed to reach the next light when it is green. The interior is relatively close to the TT's with leather upholstery from Italian fashion brand Poltrona Frau and features a high-tech TFT display in front of the driver populated with the information that would normally be projected onto a central, dash-mounted screen\u2014i.e. navigation, entertainment. The trunk of the vehicle contains a 1:8 scale RC car as a souvenir.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/audi-tt-offroad-concept-photos-and-info-news|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/282254/audi-tt-offroad-concept-revealed/|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept revealed|work=caradvice.com.au/}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Audi TT Offroad Concept (22).JPG|Audi TT Off-Road Concept\n</gallery>\n\n==Marketing==\nDue to [[Audi]]'s heavy sponsorship of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the TT S coupe made a cameo in [[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://fourtitude.com/news/Audi_News_1/audi-tts-confirmed-in-avengers-age-of-ultron/|title=Audi TTS in Age of Ultron|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> and a convertible TTS was driven by [[Peter Parker]] in [[Spider-Man: Homecoming]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20170620/RETAIL03/170629980/audi-to-star-in-new-spider-man-movie|title=Audi In Homecoming|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n* Lewandowski, J\u00fcrgen, Staretz, David, V\u00f6lker, Herbert: ''Das TT Buch.''
