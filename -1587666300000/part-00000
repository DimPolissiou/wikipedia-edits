[[Bread flour#Types of Flour|Bread flour]] or other high [[gluten]] flours are preferred to create the firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often [[barley malt]] (syrup or crystals), honey, [[high fructose corn syrup]], or [[sugar]], with or without eggs, milk or butter.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Leavening can be accomplished using a [[sourdough]] technique or a commercially produced yeast.\n\nBagels are traditionally made by:\n* mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough\n* shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough\n* [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature (40\u201350&nbsp;\u00b0F = 4.5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b0C)\n* boiling each bagel in water for 60\u201390 seconds that may contain additives such as [[lye]], [[baking soda]], [[barley malt syrup]], or [[honey]]\n* baking at between 175&nbsp;\u00b0C and 315&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 350\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0F)\n\nThis production method gives bagels their distinctive taste, chewy texture, and shiny appearance.\n\nIn recent years, a variant has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system.<ref>Reinhart, P. (2001).''The Bread Baker's Apprentice''. Ten Speed Press, p. 115.</ref> In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a [[Bread roll|finger roll]] that happens to be shaped like a bagel. The dough used is intentionally more [[base (chemistry)|alkaline]] to aid browning, because the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nBagels can be frozen for up to six months.<ref>Jonathan, Croswell.

The taste may be complemented by additions cooked on the bagel, such as onion, garlic, sesame seeds, or poppy seeds. The appeal of a bagel may change upon being toasted. Toasting can have the effect of bringing or removing desirable chewiness, softening the crust, and moderating off-flavors.<ref name=\"Consumer Reports 2012\">{{cite web |url= http://consumerreports.org/cro/bagels/buying-guide.htm |title=Top Bagels \u2013 Bagel Buying Guide |work=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nA typical bagel has 260\u2013350 calories, 1.0\u20134.5 grams of fat, 330\u2013660 milligrams of sodium, and 2\u20135 grams of fiber.

They are available in many varieties (sweet or savoury) in supermarkets.\n\nGerman ''[[pretzel]]s'' (which are soft and formed into rings or long rectangular shapes) are somewhat similar to bagels in texture, the main exceptions being the shape and the [[Lye|alkaline water]] bath that makes the surface dark and glossy.\n\nIn [[Romania]], ''[[covrigi]]'' are topped with poppy, sesame seeds or large salt grains, especially in the central area of the country. The recipe does not contain any added sweetener. They are usually shaped like pretzels rather than bagels.\n\nIn some parts of [[Austria]], ring-shaped pastries called ''Beugel'' are sold in the weeks before [[Easter]]. Like a bagel, the yeasted wheat dough, usually flavored with [[caraway]], is boiled before baking. However, the ''Beugel'' is crispy and can be stored for weeks. Traditionally it has to be torn apart by two individuals before eating.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[File:Guangzhou-Nur-Bostani-Restaurant-pseudo-bagel-0504.jpg|thumb|right|A ''girdeh'' (the hole does not go all the way through) from a Muslim restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\n\nIn [[Turkey]], a salty and fattier form is called ''a\u00e7ma''.

[[Bread flour#Types of Flour|Bread flour]] or other high [[gluten]] flours are preferred to create the firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often [[barley malt]] (syrup or crystals), honey, [[high fructose corn syrup]], or [[sugar]], with or without eggs, milk or butter.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Leavening can be accomplished using a [[sourdough]] technique or a commercially produced yeast.\n\nBagels are traditionally made by:\n* mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough\n* shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough\n* [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature (40\u201350&nbsp;\u00b0F = 4.5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b0C)\n* boiling each bagel in water for 60\u201390 seconds that may contain additives such as [[lye]], [[baking soda]], [[barley malt syrup]], or [[honey]]\n* baking at between 175&nbsp;\u00b0C and 315&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 350\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0F)\n\nThis production method gives bagels their distinctive taste, chewy texture, and shiny appearance.\n\nIn recent years, a variant has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel.

The steam bagel results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a [[Bread roll|finger roll]] that happens to be shaped like a bagel.

The taste may be complemented by additions cooked on the bagel, such as onion, garlic, sesame seeds, or poppy seeds. The appeal of a bagel may change upon being toasted.

Thus, [[Chicago]]-style bagels are baked or baked with steam. The traditional [[London]] bagel (or beigel as it is spelled) is harder and has a coarser texture with air bubbles.\n\nPoppy seeds are sometimes referred to by their Yiddish name, spelled either ''mun'' or ''mon'' (written \u05de\u05d0\u05b8\u05df), which comes from the German word for poppy, ''Mohn'', as used in ''Mohnbr\u00f6tchen''. American chef [[John Mitzewich]] suggests a recipe for what he calls \u201cSan Francisco-Style Bagels\u201d. His recipe yields bagels flatter than New York-style bagels, characterized by a rough-textured crust.<ref name=\"ChefJohn1\">{{cite web | last =Mitzewich | first =John | authorlink =John Mitzewich | title =San Francisco-Style Bagels \u2013 Taking Things to a Hole New Level | work =Food Wishes | publisher =[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] | date =August 6, 2012 | url =http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/08/san-francisco-style-bagels-taking.html |accessdate =August 7, 2012}}</ref> An [[everything bagel]] may include such toppings as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, caraway seeds, garlic flakes, pretzel salt, cinnamon raisin and pepper.{{clear}}\n\n== Non-traditional doughs and types ==\n\nWhile normally and traditionally made of [[yeast]]ed [[wheat]], in the late 20th century variations on the bagel flourished. Non-traditional versions that change the dough recipe include [[pumpernickel]], [[rye]], [[sourdough]], [[bran]], [[whole wheat]], and [[Multigrain bread|multigrain]]. Other variations change the flavor of the dough, often using [[blueberry]], [[salt]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[cinnamon]], [[raisin]], [[chocolate chip]], [[cheese]], or some combination of the above. Green bagels are sometimes created for [[St. Patrick's Day]].\n\nMany corporate chains now offer bagels in such flavors as chocolate chip and French toast.\n\nSandwich bagels have been popularized since the late 1990s by specialty shops such as [[Bruegger's]] and [[Einstein Brothers]], and fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]].\n\nBreakfast bagels, a softer, sweeter variety usually sold in fruity or sweet flavors (e.g., cherry, strawberry, cheese, blueberry, cinnamon-raisin, chocolate chip, maple syrup, banana and nuts) are common at large supermarket chains. These are usually sold sliced and are intended to be prepared in a toaster.\n\nA flat bagel, known as a 'flagel', can be found in a few locations in and around New York City, [[Long Island]], and Toronto. According to a review attributed to New York's ''[[Village Voice]]'' food critic Robert Seitsema, the flagel was first created by [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn's]] 'Tasty Bagels' deli in the early 1990s.<ref>Browne, Alaina [http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/09/flat-bagels-flagels-davids-gramercy-nyc.html Flagel = Flat Bagel (review)], retrieved 2009-04-24 from SeriousEats.com website;</ref>\n\nThe New York Style Snacks brand has developed the baked snacks referred to as Bagel Crisps and Bagel Chips, which are marketed as a representation of the \"authentic taste\" of New York City bakery bagels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkstyle.com/products/ |title=New York Style Baked Snacks |publisher=Newyorkstyle.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n\nThough the original bagel has a fairly well-defined recipe and method of production, there is no legal [[standard of identity]] for bagels in the United States.

The ''[[bublik]]'' in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], and the ''obwarzanek'' (in particular ''[[obwarzanek krakowski]]'') in Poland are essentially larger bagels with a wider hole. Somewhat similar in appearance to bagels, these breads are usually topped with sesame and poppy seeds. The ingredients in these breads and bagels somewhat differ, as these breads often are made with [[butter]]<ref>{{cite web | author =  Victoria Drey | title = Bubliki: The star of a Russian-style bagel brunch |url=https://www.rbth.com/russian-kitchen/330120-bubliki-russian-style-bagel | publisher = Russian Beyond | date = 19 March 2019 }}</ref> and sometimes also with milk,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bublik |url=https://thebreadguru.com/bublik-recipe/ |website=The Bread Guru |accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref> which are forbidden to be used in bagels due to [[kashrut]], or Jewish religious dietary laws. Other ring-shaped breads known among [[East Slavs]] are ''baranki'' (smaller and drier) and ''[[sushki]]'' (even smaller and drier). In [[Lithuania]], similar breads are called ''riestainiai'', or sometimes by their Slavic name ''baronkos''.\n\n[[File:Vesirinkelit - 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Vesirinkeli'' from Finland]]\nIn [[Finland]], ''[[vesirinkeli]]'' are small rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread. They are placed in salted boiling water before being baked. They are often eaten for breakfast toasted and buttered. They are available in many varieties (sweet or savoury) in supermarkets.\n\nGerman ''[[pretzel]]s'' (which are soft and formed into rings or long rectangular shapes) are somewhat similar to bagels in texture, the main exceptions being the shape and the [[Lye|alkaline water]] bath that makes the surface dark and glossy.\n\nIn [[Romania]], ''[[covrigi]]'' are topped with poppy, sesame seeds or large salt grains, especially in the central area of the country. The recipe does not contain any added sweetener. They are usually shaped like pretzels rather than bagels.\n\nIn some parts of [[Austria]], ring-shaped pastries called ''Beugel'' are sold in the weeks before [[Easter]]. Like a bagel, the yeasted wheat dough, usually flavored with [[caraway]], is boiled before baking. However, the ''Beugel'' is crispy and can be stored for weeks. Traditionally it has to be torn apart by two individuals before eating.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[File:Guangzhou-Nur-Bostani-Restaurant-pseudo-bagel-0504.jpg|thumb|right|A ''girdeh'' (the hole does not go all the way through) from a Muslim restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\n\nIn [[Turkey]], a salty and fattier form is called ''a\u00e7ma''.

The alliance army's numbers were estimated to be over 40,000.

This consisted of 40,000 men and was defeated by a British army comprising 10,000 men. The Nawabs had virtually lost their military power after the battle of Buxar.\n\nThe lack of basic co-ordination among the three disparate allies was responsible for their decisive defeat.\n\n[[Mirza Najaf Khan]] commanded the right flank of the Mughal imperial army and was the first to advance his forces against Major [[Hector Munro, 8th of Novar|Hector Munro]] at daybreak; the British lines formed within twenty minutes and reversed the advance of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s. According to the British, [[Durrani]] and [[Rohilla]] cavalry were also present and fought during the battle in various skirmishes. But by midday, the battle was over and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] blew up large tumbrils and three massive magazines of gunpowder.\n\nMunro divided his army into various columns and particularly pursued the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] the [[Nawab of Awadh]], who responded by blowing up his boat-bridge after crossing the river, thus abandoning the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Alam II]] and members of his own regiment. [[Mir Qasim]] also fled with his 3 million rupees worth of [[Gemstone]]s and later died in poverty in 1777. Mirza Najaf Khan reorganised formations around [[Shah Alam II]], who retreated and then chose to negotiate with the victorious British.\n\nHistorian [[John William Fortescue]] claimed that the British casualties totalled 847: 39 killed and 64 wounded from the European regiments and 250 killed, 435 wounded and 85 missing from the East India Company's sepoys.<ref name=Fortescue102 /> He also claimed that the three Indian allies suffered 2,000 dead and that many more were wounded.<ref name=Fortescue102 /> Another source says that there were 69 European and 664 sepoy casualties on the British side and 6,000 casualties on the Mughal side.<ref name=Black160/> The victors captured 133 pieces of artillery and over 1 million rupees of cash. Immediately after the battle Munro decided to assist the [[Maratha]]s, who were described as a \"warlike race\", well known for their relentless and unwavering hatred towards the [[Mughal Empire]] and its [[Nawab]]s and [[Sultanate of Mysore|Mysore]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British victory at Buxar had \"at one fell swoop\", disposed of the three main scions of Mughal power in Upper India. Mir Kasim [Qasim]  disappeared into an impoverished obscurity. Shah Alam realigned himself with the British, and Shah Shuja [Shuja-ud-Daula] fled west hotly pursued by the victors. The whole Ganges valley lay at the Company's mercy; Shah Shuja eventually surrendered; henceforth Company troops became the power-brokers throughout Oudh as well as Bihar\".<ref name=\"Keay2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdgQt6Tc54C | title=The Honourable Company | publisher=HarperCollins UK | date=8 July 2010 | last=Keay | first=John | authorlink=John Keay | edition=Paperback | location=London | page=374 | isbn=978-0-00-739554-5}}</ref>\n\n==Other Conclusions==\nThis battle really turned around the future path for India.

[[Mir Jafar]] was made the Nawab of Bengal for a second time in 1763 by the Company, just after the battle. After being defeated in 4 battles in [[Battle of Katwa|Katwa]], [[Battle of Giria|Giria]] and Udaynala, the [[Nawab of Awadh]] [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] and the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Alam II]], accompanied by Raja Balwant Singh of Kashi made an alliance with Mir Qasim.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Modern History (1707\u20131947) |author=Parshotam Mehra |isbn=0-19-561552-2 |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> The battle was fought at [[Buxar]], a \"small fortified town\" within the territory of [[Bihar]], located on the banks of the [[Ganga|Ganga river]] about {{convert|130|km}} west of [[Patna]]; it was a decisive victory for the British [[East India Company]].

The alliance army's numbers were estimated to be over 40,000. The British East India Company was at war with the alliance of Indian states that was composed of Bengal, Awadh, and the Mughal Empire <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Buxar}}</ref>. This consisted of 40,000 men and was defeated by a British army comprising 10,000 men. The Nawabs had virtually lost their military power after the battle of Buxar.\n\nThe lack of basic co-ordination among the three disparate allies was responsible for their decisive defeat.\n\n[[Mirza Najaf Khan]] commanded the right flank of the Mughal imperial army and was the first to advance his forces against Major [[Hector Munro, 8th of Novar|Hector Munro]] at daybreak; the British lines formed within twenty minutes and reversed the advance of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s. According to the British, [[Durrani]] and [[Rohilla]] cavalry were also present and fought during the battle in various skirmishes. But by midday, the battle was over and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] blew up large tumbrils and three massive magazines of gunpowder.\n\nMunro divided his army into various columns and particularly pursued the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] the [[Nawab of Awadh]], who responded by blowing up his boat-bridge after crossing the river, thus abandoning the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Alam II]] and members of his own regiment. [[Mir Qasim]] also fled with his 3 million rupees worth of [[Gemstone]]s and later died in poverty in 1777. Mirza Najaf Khan reorganised formations around [[Shah Alam II]], who retreated and then chose to negotiate with the victorious British.\n\nHistorian [[John William Fortescue]] claimed that the British casualties totalled 847: 39 killed and 64 wounded from the European regiments and 250 killed, 435 wounded and 85 missing from the East India Company's sepoys.<ref name=Fortescue102 /> He also claimed that the three Indian allies suffered 2,000 dead and that many more were wounded.<ref name=Fortescue102 /> Another source says that there were 69 European and 664 sepoy casualties on the British side and 6,000 casualties on the Mughal side.<ref name=Black160/> The victors captured 133 pieces of artillery and over 1 million rupees of cash. Immediately after the battle Munro decided to assist the [[Maratha]]s, who were described as a \"warlike race\", well known for their relentless and unwavering hatred towards the [[Mughal Empire]] and its [[Nawab]]s and [[Sultanate of Mysore|Mysore]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British victory at Buxar had \"at one fell swoop\", disposed of the three main scions of Mughal power in Upper India. Mir Kasim [Qasim]  disappeared into an impoverished obscurity. Shah Alam realigned himself with the British, and Shah Shuja [Shuja-ud-Daula] fled west hotly pursued by the victors. The whole Ganges valley lay at the Company's mercy; Shah Shuja eventually surrendered; henceforth Company troops became the power-brokers throughout Oudh as well as Bihar\".<ref name=\"Keay2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdgQt6Tc54C | title=The Honourable Company | publisher=HarperCollins UK | date=8 July 2010 | last=Keay | first=John | authorlink=John Keay | edition=Paperback | location=London | page=374 | isbn=978-0-00-739554-5}}</ref>\n\n==Other Conclusions==\nThis battle really turned around the future path for India.

Armed with four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns, the ships were much larger and more powerfully-armed than their predecessors. Completed in 1907, she was assigned to the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] ({{lang|fr|Escadre de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e}}).\n\nDuring [[World War I]], ''Victor Hugo'' escorted convoys as well as the [[capital ship]]s of the French fleet. The ship participated in the blockade of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] until 1917 when she was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. Four years later, the cruiser was reactivated; she served in the [[Far East]] in 1922\u20131923 and went back into reserve upon her return. ''Victor Hugo'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1930.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Gambetta class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1923]]\nThe ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''-class ships were designed as enlarged and more powerful versions of the {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. ''Victor Hugo'', the last ship to be built, was slightly longer than her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|French cruiser|L\u00e9on Gambetta||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Ferry||2}} and measured {{convert|149.07|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.18|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The sisters were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|12550|t|LT|sp=us|lk=on}} at normal load. Their crew normally numbered 26 officers and 708 enlisted men, or 30 officers and 749 men when serving as a [[flagship]].<ref name=jc3>Jordan & Caresse, p. 143</ref>\n\nThe ships had three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Each of the sisters used a different model of [[water-tube boiler]] and ''Victor Hugo'' was fitted with 28 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|27500|PS|lk=on|sp=us}} to reach their designed speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 2 March 1907, ''Victor Hugo'' reached {{convert|22.3|kn}} from {{convert|28344|PS}}. The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of {{convert|7500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 157\u2013158, 160</ref>\n\nThe [[main battery]] of the ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' class consisted of four [[Canon de 194 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893-1896|194-millimeter Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896]] guns mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. Their [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] comprised sixteen [[Canon de 164 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893|{{convert|164|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896M]] guns. Twelve of these were in three twin-gun turrets on each [[broadside]] and the remaining four guns were in [[Casemate#Single casemates (1889 onwards)|casemates]] in the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]].<ref name=g5>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 306</ref> Unlike her sisters, ''Victor Hugo'' was fitted with twenty-four  [[Canon de 47 mm mod\u00e8le 1902|{{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} Canon de 47 mm mod\u00e8le 1902 guns]] for anti-[[torpedo boat]] defense.<ref name=s2>Silverstone, p. 80</ref> She was also armed with two submerged {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each broadside, and could carry 20 [[naval mine]]s.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 145, 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nThe cruisers' [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] ranged in thickness from {{convert|80|to|150|mm|1|sp=us}} and the main-gun turrets were protected by armor {{convert|138|mm|1|sp=us}} thick. Their [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{cvt|33|to|65|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick.

The order was transferred to the [[Arsenal de Lorient]] on 3 June 1902 even though that [[shipyard]] was fully committed to building two of the preceding {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. Coupled with the need to transport the assembled materials to [[Lorient]], the change delayed her [[keel laying]] until 2 March 1903. ''Victor Hugo'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 30 March 1904 and began her sea trials on 15 January 1907. The cruiser was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] ({{lang|fr|armement d\u00e9finitif}}) on 16 April. Her construction cost 30,748,300 [[French franc|francs]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139\u2013141, 160, 213</ref>\n\nOn 8 May ''Victor Hugo'' departed Lorient for [[Jamestown, Virginia]], to participate in the [[Jamestown Exposition]], together with the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Kl\u00e9ber||2}} and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Chasseloup-Laubat||2}}. By 20 May they were visiting New York City; the ships returned to Jamestown on 31 May where they participated in the [[naval review]] presided over by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on 10 June. Upon her return to France later that month, ''Victor Hugo'' was assigned to the Light Squadron ({{lang|fr|Escadre l\u00e9g\u00e8re}}) of the Mediterranean Squadron. On 5 October 1909, the French Navy reorganized its forces and redesignated the Mediterranean Squadron as the 1st Squadron ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Escadre}}) and the Light Squadron became the 1st Light Division ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Division l\u00e9g\u00e8re}} (DL)). The ship was assigned to the 2nd DL of the 1st Squadron on 4 April 1911 with her sisters, although she was reduced to reserve later in the year. ''Victor Hugo'' had been reactivated by 10 February 1912 when she was reassigned to the 2nd DL.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 160, 210\u2013211; Sieche, pp. 150, 155, 157</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the [[Royal Navy]] would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate her fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French designated the consolidated fleet the 1st Naval Army ({{lang|fr|1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e Navale}}) and grouped its two DLs into the 1st Light Squadron.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 210, 214</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nWhen [[Imperial Germany]] declared war on France on 3 August 1914, the ship was still assigned to the 2nd DL. The following day the cruisers were part of the escorting force for a troop convoy from [[Algiers]], [[French Algeria]] to [[Metropolitan France]]. On 13 August Vice Admiral [[Augustin Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re]], commander of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces in the Central Mediterranean, was ordered to begin offensive operations against the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic. He decided to break the Austro-Hungarian blockade of the port of [[Bar|Antivari]], [[Montenegro]], and to engage any ships operating out of nearby [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. He split his available forces into two groups with the armored cruisers following the Albanian coast and the battleships tracing the Italian coast before cutting across the Adriatic to rendezvous at Antivari on the morning of the 16th. The latter sank the [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Zenta}} that morning in the [[Battle of Antivari]] as the armored cruisers were coming up from the south.<ref>Freivogel, pp. 96, 101; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 218, 222, 227</ref>\n\nAt the end of the month, the French began intermittently escorting single [[cargo ship]]s to Antivari, usually escorted by the armored cruisers and covered by the main battlefleet. The first of these was on 31 September when four armored cruisers escorted the steamer {{SS|Liamone}} while the battleships bombarded the defenses of Cattaro. The 2nd DL escorted the cargo ship {{SS|Henri Fraissinet}} as it brought long-range artillery pieces to Antivari on 18\u201319 September. On the return voyage, they took advantage of the fog to bombard Cattaro before they were forced to withdraw by heavy return fire. The 2nd DL participated in the next sortie into the Adriatic on 17 October, but it was uneventful. During the following mission, begun at the end of October, the 2nd DL raided the island of [[Lastovo]] on 2 November and ''Jules Ferry'' was narrowly missed by ''[[SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)|U-5]]'', an Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]], on the return voyage the following day. The torpedoing of the [[dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}} on 21 December brought an end to the sorties into the Adriatic by the battlefleet; henceforth the supply ships were escorted by the armored cruisers or smaller ships. The French also responded by moving their patrol line further south to a line north of the Greek island of [[Corfu]].<ref>Freivogel, pp. 98\u2013100, 117\u2013122; Halpern, p. 4; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] on 26 April 1915, agreeing to declare war on Austro-Hungary. Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re, concerned about a possible pre-emptive attack on the southern Italian ports, temporarily moved all of his armored cruisers, including the three sisters, closer to the Strait of Otranto that day. ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' was torpedoed and sunk by ''U-5'' with heavy loss of life on the 27th. After the sinking, Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re withdrew his armored cruisers even further south to a patrol line running through the Gerogombos [[lighthouse]] on the island of [[Cephalonia]]. He also ordered that patrols should be made a speed of {{convert|14|kn}}, not the leisurely {{convert|6|kn}} used by ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''{{'}}s late [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. After the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, the French ships withdrew further into the Mediterranean and [[Ionian Sea]]s with the 2nd DL ultimately basing itself at [[Alexandria]], [[Sultanate of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Bizerte]], [[French Tunisia]], and [[Crown Colony of Malta|British Malta]]; the division was responsible for patrolling the area between [[Capo Colonna]] in southern Italy and the easternmost point of the Greek island of [[Crete]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1915, the French and British decided that the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Serbian Army's position in Montenegro and Albania]] was untenable and that it would have to be evacuated. ''Victor Hugo'' helped transfer some of the evacuees from [[Brindisi]], Italy, to Bizerte in early January. The Allies occupied the neutral island of Corfu on 9 January to provide a place for the Serbs to recuperate and to rebuild the army. In March, they decided to occupy the Greek island of [[Argostoli]] to serve as a base for the battlefleet while the armored cruisers were based further north at Corfu. The [[Royal Serbian Army]] deemed fit for combat in May and the French armored cruisers provided distant [[Covering force|cover]]            for the transfer to the Salonica Front until it was completed on 15 June. Shortages of coal and trained manpower hampered most training for the rest of the year and became worse in 1917. As tensions rose between the Allies and the neutral Greek government in early 1917, ''Victor Hugo'' and the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Michelet||2}} were tasked to patrol the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and prevent any Greek troops from moving from their positions in the [[Peloponese]] across the bridge over the [[Corinth Canal]] on 28 April to interfere with Allied operations in [[Athens]]. The 2nd DL landed a [[company (military)|company]] of [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese troops]] on 11 June and reinforced them with machine-gun armed sailors until King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] abdicated the following day and a pro-Allied government was installed. On 12 August, the 2nd DL was disbanded with ''Victor Hugo'' reduced to reserve at Bizerte and ''Jules Ferry'' was assigned to transport duties for the next year.<ref>Freivogel, p. 219; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 238\u2013240, 243\u2013245</ref>\n\n''Victor Hugo'' was reactivated in 1921 and assigned to the Atlantic Flying Division ({{lang|fr|Division volante de l'Atlantique}}). The following year she was transferred to the Far Eastern Division ({{lang|fr|Division navale de l'Extr\u00eame Orient}}).

{"title_page": "Skin", "text_new": "\n\n ivided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position. BMP signals from the epidermis inhibit the formation of placodes in nearby ectoderm.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|It is believed that the mesoderm defines the pattern. The epidermis instructs the mesodermal cells to condense and then the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of what structure to make through a series of reciprocal inductions.

This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'' that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The papillae provide the [[dermis]] with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker.

Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying [[bone]] and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. It consists of loose [[connective tissue]] and [[elastin]]. The main [[cell (biology)|cell]] types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of [[body fat]]). [[Fat]] serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n[[Microorganisms]] like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface.

The [[dermis]] of [[bony fish]] typically contains relatively little of the [[connective tissue]] found in [[tetrapod]]s. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony [[scale (zoology)|scales]]. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the [[skull]], these [[scale (zoology)|scales]] are lost in [[tetrapods]], although many [[reptile]]s do have [[scale (zoology)|scales]] of a different kind, as do [[pangolin]]s. [[Cartilaginous fish]] have numerous tooth-like [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] embedded in their skin, in place of true [[scale (zoology)|scales]].\n\n[[Sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s are both unique to [[mammals]], but other types of skin gland are found in other [[vertebrates]]. [[Fish]] typically have a numerous individual [[mucus]]-secreting skin [[cell (biology)|cells]] that aid in insulation and protection, but may also have [[poison]] [[glands]], [[photophore]]s, or [[cell (biology)|cells]] that produce a more watery, [[serous]] fluid. In [[amphibians]], the [[mucus]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are gathered together to form sac-like [[glands]]. Most living [[amphibians]] also possess ''granular [[glands]]'' in the skin, that secrete irritating or toxic compounds.<ref name=VB/>\n\nAlthough [[melanin]] is found in the skin of many species, in the [[reptile]]s, the [[amphibians]], and [[fish]], the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is often relatively colorless. Instead, the color of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to melanin, may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the color of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].<ref name=VB/>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n''See also: [[amphibian]]s''\n\n==== Overview ====\nAmphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms |publisher= ScienceDirect|language=en|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1\u201329 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:FrogSkin.png|thumb|616x616px|'''Frog Gland Anatomy-''' A: Mucous gland (alveolus), B: Chromophore, C: Granular Gland (alveolus), D: Connective Tissue, E: Stratum Corneum, F: Transition Zone (intercalary region), G: Epidermis (Where the duct resides), H: Dermis]]\n\n==== Granular Glands ====\nGranular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStructurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA635&lpg=PA635&dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position. BMP signals from the epidermis inhibit the formation of placodes in nearby ectoderm.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|It is believed that the mesoderm defines the pattern. The epidermis instructs the mesodermal cells to condense and then the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of what structure to make through a series of reciprocal inductions.
