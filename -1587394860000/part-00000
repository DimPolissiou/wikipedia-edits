It is particularly useful in handling [[Data model|structured data]], i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\n\nSQL offers two main advantages over older read&ndash;write [[API]]s such as [[ISAM]] or [[VSAM]]. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify ''how'' to reach a record, e.g. with or without an [[Database index|index]].\n\nOriginally based upon [[relational algebra]] and [[tuple relational calculus]], SQL consists of many types of statements,<ref>[[SQL-92]], 4.22 SQL-statements, 4.22.1  Classes of SQL-statements \"There are at least five ways of classifying SQL-statements:\", 4.22.2, SQL statements classified by function \"The following are the main classes of SQL-statements:\"; [[SQL:2003]] 4.11 SQL-statements, and later revisions.</ref> which may be informally classed as [[sublanguage]]s, commonly: a [[data query language]] (DQL),{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-data\" statements ''excluding'' \"SQL-data change\" statements; this is primarily the [[Select (SQL)|Select]] statement.}} a [[data definition language]] (DDL),{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-schema\" statements.}} a [[data control language]] (DCL), and a [[data manipulation language]] (DML).{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-data change\" statements}}<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Structured Query Language By Example - Volume I: Data Query Language\n|first=Mark\n|last=Chatham\n|year=2012\n|isbn=978-1-29119951-2\n|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=64MBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 8]\n}}</ref> The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition ([[database schema|schema]] creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a [[Declarative programming|declarative language]] ([[4GL]]), it also includes [[Procedural programming|procedural]] elements.\n\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize [[Edgar F. Codd]]\u2019s [[relational model]]. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".<ref name=\"codd-relational-model\" />  Despite not entirely adhering to [[Codd's 12 rules|the relational model as described by Codd]], it became the most widely used database language.<ref name=\"SQL-Fundamentals\" /><ref name=\"IBM-sql\" />\n\nSQL became a [[Technical standard|standard]] of the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986, and of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1987.<ref name=\"ISO 9075:1987\" /> Since then the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\nSQL was initially developed at [[IBM]] by [[Donald D. Chamberlin]] and [[Raymond F. Boyce]] after learning about the relational model from [[Ted Codd]]<ref name=\"Early History\"/> in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"chamberlin-boyce-sequel\" /> This version, initially called ''SEQUEL'' (''Structured English Query Language''), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, [[IBM System R|System R]], which a group at [[IBM Almaden Research Center|IBM San Jose Research Laboratory]] had developed during the 1970s.<ref name=\"chamberlin-boyce-sequel\" />\n\nChamberlin and Boyce's first attempt of a relational database language was Square, but it was difficult to use due to subscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on SEQUEL.<ref name=\"Early History\"/> The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because \"SEQUEL\" was a [[trademark]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK-based]] [[Hawker Siddeley]] Dynamics Engineering Limited company.<ref name=\"oppel-databases\" />\n\nAfter testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype including [[IBM System/38|System/38]], [[IBM SQL/DS|SQL/DS]], and [[IBM DB2|DB2]], which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.<ref name=\"IBM-history\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now [[Oracle Corporation]]) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based [[Relational database|RDMS]] with aspirations of selling it to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and other [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software, Inc. introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL, [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] V2 (Version2) for [[VAX]] computers.\n\nBy 1986, [[ANSI]] and [[ISO]] standard groups officially adopted the standard \"Database Language SQL\" language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011<ref name=\"Early History\">{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlin|first1=Donald|title=Early History of SQL|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|date=2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=78\u201382|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2012.61}}</ref> and, most recently, 2016.\n\n==Design==\n\nSQL deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation, the [[relational model]] and its [[tuple relational calculus|tuple calculus]].  In that model, a table is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of tuples, while in SQL, tables and query results are [[list (computing)|list]]s of rows: the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries (e.g. in the LIMIT clause).\n\nCritics argue that SQL should be replaced with a language that returns strictly to the original foundation: for example, see ''[[The Third Manifesto]]''. However, no known proof exists that such uniqueness cannot be added to SQL itself{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}, or at least a variation of SQL. In other words, it's quite possible that SQL can be \"fixed\" or at least improved in this regard such that the industry may not have to switch to a completely different query language to obtain uniqueness. Debate on this remains open.\n\n==Syntax==\n{{Main|SQL syntax}}\n\n{{Image frame|content=\n<math>\n\\left. \\begin{array}{rl} \\textstyle\\mathtt{UPDATE~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{UPDATE\\ country}  \\\\\n\\textstyle\\mathtt{SET~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{SET\\ population =~} \\overbrace\\mathtt{population + 1}^\\mathtt{expression}  \\\\\n\\textstyle\\mathtt{WHERE~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{WHERE\\ \\underbrace{{name =} \\overbrace{'USA'}^{expression}}_{predicate};}\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}{\\textstyle\\texttt{statement}}\n</math>\n|width=500|caption=A chart showing several of the SQL language elements that compose a single statement}}\n\nThe SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:\n\n* ''Clauses'', which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)<ref name=\"ANSI/ISO/IEC\" />\n* ''Expressions'', which can produce either [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] values, or [[table (database)|tables]] consisting of [[column (database)|columns]] and [[row (database)|rows]] of data\n* ''Predicates'', which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL [[ternary logic|three-valued logic (3VL)]] (true/false/unknown) or [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[truth value]]s and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.\n* ''Queries'', which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of ''SQL''.\n* ''Statements'', which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control [[Database transaction|transactions]], program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.\n** SQL statements also include the [[semicolon]] (\";\") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.\n* ''[[Whitespace (computer science)|Insignificant whitespace]]'' is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.\n\n==Procedural extensions==\n\nSQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query [[data]] contained in a [[relational database]]. SQL is a [[Set (computer science)|set]]-based, [[declarative programming language]], not an [[imperative programming language]] like [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[BASIC]]. However, extensions to Standard SQL add [[procedural programming language]] functionality, such as control-of-flow constructs. These include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Source\n!

The SQL standard defines [[SQL/JRT]] extensions (SQL Routines and Types for the Java Programming Language) to support [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code in SQL databases. [[Microsoft SQL Server 2005]] uses the [[SQLCLR]] (SQL Server Common Language Runtime) to host managed [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] assemblies in the database, while prior versions of SQL Server were restricted to unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written in C. [[PostgreSQL]] lets users write functions in a wide variety of languages\u2014including [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Tcl]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8) and C.<ref name=\"PostgreSQL server programming\" />\n\n==Interoperability and standardization==\n\nSQL implementations are incompatible between vendors and do not necessarily completely follow standards. In particular date and time syntax, string concatenation, <code>NULL</code>s, and comparison [[case sensitivity]] vary from vendor to vendor. Particular exceptions are [[PostgreSQL]]<ref name=\"About PostgreSQL\" /> and [[Mimer SQL]]<ref name=\"Mimer SQL, Built on Standards\" /> which strive for standards compliance, though PostgreSQL does not adhere to the standard in how folding of unquoted names is done. The folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS|title=4.1. Lexical Structure|date=2018|website=PostgreSQL documentation}}</ref> which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt|title=(Second Informal Review Draft) ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Database Language SQL, Section 5.2, syntax rule 11|date=30 July 1992}}</ref> Thus, <code>Foo</code> should be equivalent to <code>FOO</code> not <code>foo</code> according to the standard.\n\nPopular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the <code>DATE</code> or <code>TIME</code> data types.  The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are Oracle (whose <code>DATE</code> behaves as <code>DATETIME</code>,<ref name=\"Ora DATE\" /><ref name=\"Ora DATETIME\" /> and lacks a <code>TIME</code> type)<ref name=\"Ora TIME\" /> and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). As a result, SQL code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications.\n\nThere are several reasons for this lack of portability between database systems:\n\n* The complexity and size of the SQL standard means that most implementors do not support the entire standard.\n* The standard does not specify database behavior in several important areas (e.g. [[index (database)|indexes]], file storage...), leaving implementations to decide how to behave.\n* The SQL standard precisely specifies the syntax that a conforming database system must implement. However, the standard's specification of the semantics of language constructs is less well-defined, leading to ambiguity.\n* Many database vendors have large existing customer bases; where the newer version of the SQL standard conflicts with the prior behavior of the vendor's database, the vendor may be unwilling to break [[backward compatibility]].\n* There is little commercial incentive for vendors to make it easier for users to change database suppliers (see [[vendor lock-in]]).\n* Users evaluating database software tend to place other factors such as performance higher in their priorities than standards conformance.\n\nSQL was adopted as a standard by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986 as SQL-86<ref name=\"X3H2\" /> and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1987.<ref name=\"ISO 9075:1987\" /> It is maintained by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32|''ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 32, Data management and interchange'']]. The standard is commonly denoted by the pattern: ''ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title'', or, as a shortcut, ''ISO/IEC 9075''.\n\n''ISO/IEC 9075'' is complemented by ''ISO/IEC 13249: SQL Multimedia and Application Packages'' (SQL/MM), which defines SQL based interfaces and packages to widely spread applications like video, audio and [[Georeference|spatial data]].\n\nUntil 1996, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) data management standards program certified SQL DBMS compliance with the SQL standard. Vendors now self-certify the compliance of their products.<ref name=\"Doll\" />\n\nThe original standard declared that the official pronunciation for \"SQL\" was an [[initialism]]: {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u025b|s|\u02cc|k|ju\u02d0|\u02c8|\u025b|l}} (\"ess cue el\").<ref name=\"SQL-Fundamentals\" /> Regardless, many English-speaking database professionals (including [[Donald Chamberlin]] himself<ref name=\"Gillespie\" />) use the [[acronym]]-like pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|i\u02d0|k|w|\u0259l}} (\"sequel\"),<ref name=\"Melton\" /> mirroring the language's pre-release development name of \"SEQUEL\".<ref name=chamberlin-boyce-sequel /><ref name=oppel-databases /><ref name=\"Gillespie\" /><ref name=chamberlin-boyce-sequel /> The SQL standard has gone through a number of revisions:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

There are gaps in the numbering due to the withdrawal of outdated parts.\n\n* ISO/IEC 9075-1:2016 Part 1: ''Framework'' (SQL/Framework). It provides logical concepts.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC\" />\n* ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 Part 2: ''Foundation'' (SQL/Foundation). It contains the most central elements of the language and consists of both ''mandatory and optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-3:2016 Part 3: ''Call-Level Interface'' ([[SQL/CLI]]). It defines interfacing components (structures, procedures, variable bindings) that can be used to execute SQL statements from applications written in Ada, C respectively C++, COBOL, Fortran, MUMPS, Pascal or PL/I. (For Java see part 10.) SQL/CLI is defined in such a way that SQL statements and SQL/CLI procedure calls are treated as separate from the calling application's source code. [[Open Database Connectivity]] is a well-known superset of SQL/CLI. This part of the standard consists solely of ''mandatory'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-4:2016 Part 4: ''Persistent stored modules'' ([[SQL/PSM]]). It standardizes procedural extensions for SQL, including flow of control, condition handling, statement condition signals and resignals, cursors and local variables, and assignment of expressions to variables and parameters. In addition, SQL/PSM formalizes declaration and maintenance of persistent database language routines (e.g., \"stored procedures\"). This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-9:2016 Part 9: ''Management of External Data'' ([[SQL/MED]]). It provides extensions to SQL that define foreign-data wrappers and datalink types to allow SQL to manage external data. External data is data that is accessible to, but not managed by, an SQL-based DBMS. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016 Part 10: ''Object language bindings'' ([[SQL/OLB]]). It defines the syntax and semantics of [[SQLJ]], which is SQL embedded in Java (see also part 3). The standard also describes mechanisms to ensure binary portability of SQLJ applications, and specifies various Java packages and their contained classes. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features. Unlike SQL/OLB [[JDBC]] defines an [[API]] and is not part of the SQL standard.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* ISO/IEC 9075-11:2016 Part 11: ''Information and definition schemas'' ([[SQL/Schemata]]). It defines the Information Schema and Definition Schema, providing a common set of tools to make SQL databases and objects self-describing. These tools include the SQL object identifier, structure and integrity constraints, security and authorization specifications, features and packages of ISO/IEC 9075, support of features provided by SQL-based DBMS implementations, SQL-based DBMS implementation information and sizing items, and the values supported by the DBMS implementations.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC 9075-11:2008\" /> This part of the standard contains both ''mandatory and optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-13:2016 Part 13: ''SQL Routines and types using the Java TM programming language'' ([[SQL/JRT]]). It specifies the ability to invoke static Java methods as routines from within SQL applications ('Java-in-the-database'). It also calls for the ability to use Java classes as SQL structured user-defined types. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-14:2016 Part 14: ''XML-Related Specifications'' ([[SQL/XML]]). It specifies SQL-based extensions for using XML in conjunction with SQL. The ''XML'' data type is introduced, as well as several routines, functions, and XML-to-SQL data type mappings to support manipulation and storage of XML in an SQL database.<ref name=\"SQLXML2006\" /> This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n*ISO/IEC 9075-15:2019 Part 15: ''Multi-dimensional arrays'' (SQL/MDA). It specifies a multidimensional array type (MDarray) for SQL, along with operations on MDarrays, MDarray slices, MDarray cells, and related features. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n\nISO/IEC 9075 is complemented by ISO/IEC 13249 ''SQL Multimedia and Application Packages''. This closely related but separate standard is developed by the same committee. It defines interfaces and packages based on SQL. The aim is a unified access to typical database applications like text, pictures, data mining or [[Georeference|spatial data]].\n\n* ISO/IEC 13249-1:2016 Part 1: ''Framework''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-2:2003 Part 2: ''Full-Text''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 Part 3: ''Spatial''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 Part 5: ''Still image''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-6:2006 Part 6: ''Data mining''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-7:2013 Part 7: ''History''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-8:xxxx Part 8: ''Metadata Registry Access''  [https://www.iso.org/standard/73181.html MRA] (work in progress)\n\nISO/IEC 9075 is also accompanied by a series of Technical Reports, published as ISO/IEC TR 19075 in 8 parts. These Technical Reports explain the justification for and usage of some features of SQL, giving examples where appropriate. The Technical Reports are non-normative; if there is any discrepancy from 9075, the text in 9075 holds. Currently available 19075 Technical Reports are:\n\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-1:2011 Part 1: XQuery Regular Expression Support in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-2:2015 Part 2: SQL Support for Time-Related Information\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-3:2015 Part 3: SQL Embedded in Programs using the Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-4:2015 Part 4: SQL with Routines and types using the Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-5:2016 Part 5: Row Pattern Recognition in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-6:2017 Part 6: SQL support for Javascript Object Notation (JSON)\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-7:2017 Part 7: Polymorphic table functions in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-8:2019 Part 8: Multi-Dimensional Arrays (SQL/MDA)<!-- This Part passed its FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot in 2018, but was not published until June, 2019. -->\n\n==Alternatives==\nA distinction should be made between alternatives to SQL as a language, and alternatives to the relational model itself.  Below are proposed relational alternatives to the SQL language.  See [[navigational database]] and [[NoSQL]] for alternatives to the relational model.\n* [[.QL]]: object-oriented Datalog\n* [[4th Dimension (Software)|4D Query Language]] (4D QL)\n* [[Datalog]]: critics suggest that [[Datalog]] has two advantages over SQL: it has cleaner semantics, which facilitates program understanding and maintenance, and it is more expressive, in particular for recursive queries.<ref name=\"PROLE\" />\n* [[HTSQL]]: URL based query method\n* [[IBM Business System 12]] (IBM BS12): one of the first fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982\n* [[ISBL]]\n* [[Java Object Oriented Querying|jOOQ]]: SQL implemented in Java as an [[Domain-specific language|internal domain-specific language]]\n* [[Java Persistence Query Language]] (JPQL): The query language used by the Java Persistence API and [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] persistence library\n* [[JavaScript]]: [[MongoDB]] implements its query language in a JavaScript API.\n* [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]]: Runs SQL statements written like language constructs to query collections directly from inside [[.NET Framework|.Net]] code.\n* [[Object Query Language]]\n* QBE ([[Query By Example]]) created by Mosh\u00e8 Zloof, IBM 1977\n* [[QUEL query languages|Quel]] introduced in 1974 by the U.C. Berkeley Ingres project.\n* [[Tutorial D]]\n* [[XQuery]]\n\n==Distributed SQL processing==\n[[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA) was designed by a work group within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reinsch, R.|title=Distributed database for SAA|journal=IBM Systems Journal|date=1988|volume=27|issue=3|pages=362\u2013389|doi=10.1147/sj.273.0362}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Distributed Relational Database Architecture Reference|date=1990|publisher=IBM Corp. SC26-4651-0}}</ref>\n\nAn interactive user or program can issue SQL statements to a local RDB and receive tables of data and status indicators in reply from remote RDBs. SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in remote RDBs as packages and then invoked by package name. This is important for the efficient operation of application programs that issue complex, high-frequency queries. It is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems.\n\nThe messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]].\n\n==Criticisms==\nChamberlin's 2012 paper<ref name=\"Early History\" /> discusses four historical criticisms of SQL:\n\n===Orthogonality and completeness===\nEarly specifications did not support major features, such as primary keys. Result sets could not be named, and sub-queries had not been defined. These were added in 1992.<ref name=\"Early History\" />\n\n===Null===\nThe concept of [[Null_(SQL)|Null]] is subject of some [[Null_(SQL)#Criticisms|debates]]. The Null marker indicates that there is no value, even no 0 for an integer column or a string of length 0 for a text column. The concept of Nulls enforces the [[Null_(SQL)#Comparisons_with_NULL_and_the_three-valued_logic_(3VL)|3-valued-logic in SQL]], which is a concrete implementation of the general [[Three-valued_logic|3 valued logic]]. \n===Duplicates===\nAnother popular criticism is that it allows duplicate rows, making integration with languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], whose data types might make it difficult to accurately represent the data,<ref name=\"Early History\" /> difficult in terms of parsing and by the absence of modularity.<ref name=\"sqlsucks\">{{cite web|last1=Schauder|first1=Jen|title=Why SQL Sucks|url=http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2010/02/15/why-sql-sucks/|website=Schauderhaft|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis can be avoided declaring a unique constraint with one or more fields that identifies uniquely a row in the table. That constraint could also become the primary key of the table.\n\n===Impedance mismatch===\nIn a similar sense to [[Object-relational impedance mismatch]], there is a mismatch between the declarative SQL language and the procedural languages that SQL is typically embedded in.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Wikipedia books|SQL}}\n* [[Comparison of object-relational database management systems]]\n*

It is particularly useful in handling [[Data model|structured data]], i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\n\nSQL offers two main advantages over older read&ndash;write [[API]]s such as [[ISAM]] or [[VSAM]]. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify ''how'' to reach a record, e.g. with or without an [[Database index|index]].\n\nOriginally based upon [[relational algebra]] and [[tuple relational calculus]], SQL consists of many types of statements,<ref>[[SQL-92]], 4.22 SQL-statements, 4.22.1  Classes of SQL-statements \"There are at least five ways of classifying SQL-statements:\", 4.22.2, SQL statements classified by function \"The following are the main classes of SQL-statements:\"; [[SQL:2003]] 4.11 SQL-statements, and later revisions.</ref> which may be informally classed as [[sublanguage]]s, commonly: a [[data query language]] (DQL),{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-data\" statements ''excluding'' \"SQL-data change\" statements; this is primarily the [[Select (SQL)|Select]] statement.}} a [[data definition language]] (DDL),{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-schema\" statements.}} a [[data control language]] (DCL), and a [[data manipulation language]] (DML).{{efn|Formally, \"SQL-data change\" statements}}<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Structured Query Language By Example - Volume I: Data Query Language\n|first=Mark\n|last=Chatham\n|year=2012\n|isbn=978-1-29119951-2\n|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=64MBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 8]\n}}</ref> The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition ([[database schema|schema]] creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a [[Declarative programming|declarative language]] ([[4GL]]), it also includes [[Procedural programming|procedural]] elements.\n\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize [[Edgar F. Codd]]\u2019s [[relational model]]. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".<ref name=\"codd-relational-model\" />  Despite not entirely adhering to [[Codd's 12 rules|the relational model as described by Codd]], it became the most widely used database language.<ref name=\"SQL-Fundamentals\" /><ref name=\"IBM-sql\" />\n\nSQL became a [[Technical standard|standard]] of the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986, and of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1987.<ref name=\"ISO 9075:1987\" /> Since then the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\nSQL was initially developed at [[IBM]] by [[Donald D. Chamberlin]] and [[Raymond F. Boyce]] after learning about the relational model from [[Ted Codd]]<ref name=\"Early History\"/> in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"chamberlin-boyce-sequel\" /> This version, initially called ''SEQUEL'' (''Structured English Query Language''), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, [[IBM System R|System R]], which a group at [[IBM Almaden Research Center|IBM San Jose Research Laboratory]] had developed during the 1970s.<ref name=\"chamberlin-boyce-sequel\" />\n\nChamberlin and Boyce's first attempt of a relational database language was Square, but it was difficult to use due to subscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on SEQUEL.<ref name=\"Early History\"/> The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because \"SEQUEL\" was a [[trademark]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK-based]] [[Hawker Siddeley]] Dynamics Engineering Limited company.<ref name=\"oppel-databases\" />\n\nAfter testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype including [[IBM System/38|System/38]], [[IBM SQL/DS|SQL/DS]], and [[IBM DB2|DB2]], which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.<ref name=\"IBM-history\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now [[Oracle Corporation]]) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based [[Relational database|RDMS]] with aspirations of selling it to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and other [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software, Inc. introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL, [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] V2 (Version2) for [[VAX]] computers.\n\nBy 1986, [[ANSI]] and [[ISO]] standard groups officially adopted the standard \"Database Language SQL\" language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011<ref name=\"Early History\">{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlin|first1=Donald|title=Early History of SQL|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|date=2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=78\u201382|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2012.61}}</ref> and, most recently, 2016.\n\n==Design==\n\nSQL deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation, the [[relational model]] and its [[tuple relational calculus|tuple calculus]].  In that model, a table is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of tuples, while in SQL, tables and query results are [[list (computing)|list]]s of rows: the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries (e.g. in the LIMIT clause).\n\nCritics argue that SQL should be replaced with a language that returns strictly to the original foundation: for example, see ''[[The Third Manifesto]]''. However, no known proof exists that such uniqueness cannot be added to SQL itself{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}, or at least a variation of SQL. In other words, it's quite possible that SQL can be \"fixed\" or at least improved in this regard such that the industry may not have to switch to a completely different query language to obtain uniqueness. Debate on this remains open.\n\n==Syntax==\n{{Main|SQL syntax}}\n\n{{Image frame|content=\n<math>\n\\left. \\begin{array}{rl} \\textstyle\\mathtt{UPDATE~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{UPDATE\\ country}  \\\\\n\\textstyle\\mathtt{SET~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{SET\\ population =~} \\overbrace\\mathtt{population + 1}^\\mathtt{expression}  \\\\\n\\textstyle\\mathtt{WHERE~clause} & \\{ \\mathtt{WHERE\\ \\underbrace{{name =} \\overbrace{'USA'}^{expression}}_{predicate};}\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}{\\textstyle\\texttt{statement}}\n</math>\n|width=500|caption=A chart showing several of the SQL language elements that compose a single statement}}\n\nThe SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:\n\n* ''Clauses'', which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)<ref name=\"ANSI/ISO/IEC\" />\n* ''Expressions'', which can produce either [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] values, or [[table (database)|tables]] consisting of [[column (database)|columns]] and [[row (database)|rows]] of data\n* ''Predicates'', which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL [[ternary logic|three-valued logic (3VL)]] (true/false/unknown) or [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[truth value]]s and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.\n* ''Queries'', which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of ''SQL''.\n* ''Statements'', which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control [[Database transaction|transactions]], program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.\n** SQL statements also include the [[semicolon]] (\";\") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.\n* ''[[Whitespace (computer science)|Insignificant whitespace]]'' is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.\n\n==Procedural extensions==\n\nSQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query [[data]] contained in a [[relational database]]. SQL is a [[Set (computer science)|set]]-based, [[declarative programming language]], not an [[imperative programming language]] like [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[BASIC]]. However, extensions to Standard SQL add [[procedural programming language]] functionality, such as control-of-flow constructs. These include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Source\n!

The SQL standard defines [[SQL/JRT]] extensions (SQL Routines and Types for the Java Programming Language) to support [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code in SQL databases. [[Microsoft SQL Server 2005]] uses the [[SQLCLR]] (SQL Server Common Language Runtime) to host managed [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] assemblies in the database, while prior versions of SQL Server were restricted to unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written in C. [[PostgreSQL]] lets users write functions in a wide variety of languages\u2014including [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Tcl]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8) and C.<ref name=\"PostgreSQL server programming\" />\n\n==Interoperability and standardization==\n\nSQL implementations are incompatible between vendors and do not necessarily completely follow standards. In particular date and time syntax, string concatenation, <code>NULL</code>s, and comparison [[case sensitivity]] vary from vendor to vendor. Particular exceptions are [[PostgreSQL]]<ref name=\"About PostgreSQL\" /> and [[Mimer SQL]]<ref name=\"Mimer SQL, Built on Standards\" /> which strive for standards compliance, though PostgreSQL does not adhere to the standard in how folding of unquoted names is done. The folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS|title=4.1. Lexical Structure|date=2018|website=PostgreSQL documentation}}</ref> which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt|title=(Second Informal Review Draft) ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Database Language SQL, Section 5.2, syntax rule 11|date=30 July 1992}}</ref> Thus, <code>Foo</code> should be equivalent to <code>FOO</code> not <code>foo</code> according to the standard.\n\nPopular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the <code>DATE</code> or <code>TIME</code> data types.  The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are Oracle (whose <code>DATE</code> behaves as <code>DATETIME</code>,<ref name=\"Ora DATE\" /><ref name=\"Ora DATETIME\" /> and lacks a <code>TIME</code> type)<ref name=\"Ora TIME\" /> and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). As a result, SQL code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications.\n\nThere are several reasons for this lack of portability between database systems:\n\n* The complexity and size of the SQL standard means that most implementors do not support the entire standard.\n* The standard does not specify database behavior in several important areas (e.g. [[index (database)|indexes]], file storage...), leaving implementations to decide how to behave.\n* The SQL standard precisely specifies the syntax that a conforming database system must implement. However, the standard's specification of the semantics of language constructs is less well-defined, leading to ambiguity.\n* Many database vendors have large existing customer bases; where the newer version of the SQL standard conflicts with the prior behavior of the vendor's database, the vendor may be unwilling to break [[backward compatibility]].\n* There is little commercial incentive for vendors to make it easier for users to change database suppliers (see [[vendor lock-in]]).\n* Users evaluating database software tend to place other factors such as performance higher in their priorities than standards conformance.\n\nSQL was adopted as a standard by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in 1986 as SQL-86<ref name=\"X3H2\" /> and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1987.<ref name=\"ISO 9075:1987\" /> It is maintained by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32|''ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 32, Data management and interchange'']]. The standard is commonly denoted by the pattern: ''ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title'', or, as a shortcut, ''ISO/IEC 9075''.\n\n''ISO/IEC 9075'' is complemented by ''ISO/IEC 13249: SQL Multimedia and Application Packages'' (SQL/MM), which defines SQL based interfaces and packages to widely spread applications like video, audio and [[Georeference|spatial data]].\n\nUntil 1996, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) data management standards program certified SQL DBMS compliance with the SQL standard. Vendors now self-certify the compliance of their products.<ref name=\"Doll\" />\n\nThe original standard declared that the official pronunciation for \"SQL\" was an [[initialism]]: {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u025b|s|\u02cc|k|ju\u02d0|\u02c8|\u025b|l}} (\"ess cue el\").<ref name=\"SQL-Fundamentals\" /> Regardless, many English-speaking database professionals (including [[Donald Chamberlin]] himself<ref name=\"Gillespie\" />) use the [[acronym]]-like pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|i\u02d0|k|w|\u0259l}} (\"sequel\"),<ref name=\"Melton\" /> mirroring the language's pre-release development name of \"SEQUEL\".<ref name=chamberlin-boyce-sequel /><ref name=oppel-databases /><ref name=\"Gillespie\" /><ref name=chamberlin-boyce-sequel /> The SQL standard has gone through a number of revisions:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

A draft of SQL:2008 is freely available as a [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] archive.<ref name=\"Whitemarsh\" />\n\nThe SQL standard is divided into ten parts. There are gaps in the numbering due to the withdrawal of outdated parts.\n\n* ISO/IEC 9075-1:2016 Part 1: ''Framework'' (SQL/Framework). It provides logical concepts.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC\" />\n* ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 Part 2: ''Foundation'' (SQL/Foundation). It contains the most central elements of the language and consists of both ''mandatory and optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-3:2016 Part 3: ''Call-Level Interface'' ([[SQL/CLI]]). It defines interfacing components (structures, procedures, variable bindings) that can be used to execute SQL statements from applications written in Ada, C respectively C++, COBOL, Fortran, MUMPS, Pascal or PL/I. (For Java see part 10.) SQL/CLI is defined in such a way that SQL statements and SQL/CLI procedure calls are treated as separate from the calling application's source code. [[Open Database Connectivity]] is a well-known superset of SQL/CLI. This part of the standard consists solely of ''mandatory'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-4:2016 Part 4: ''Persistent stored modules'' ([[SQL/PSM]]). It standardizes procedural extensions for SQL, including flow of control, condition handling, statement condition signals and resignals, cursors and local variables, and assignment of expressions to variables and parameters. In addition, SQL/PSM formalizes declaration and maintenance of persistent database language routines (e.g., \"stored procedures\"). This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-9:2016 Part 9: ''Management of External Data'' ([[SQL/MED]]). It provides extensions to SQL that define foreign-data wrappers and datalink types to allow SQL to manage external data. External data is data that is accessible to, but not managed by, an SQL-based DBMS. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016 Part 10: ''Object language bindings'' ([[SQL/OLB]]). It defines the syntax and semantics of [[SQLJ]], which is SQL embedded in Java (see also part 3). The standard also describes mechanisms to ensure binary portability of SQLJ applications, and specifies various Java packages and their contained classes. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features. Unlike SQL/OLB [[JDBC]] defines an [[API]] and is not part of the SQL standard.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* ISO/IEC 9075-11:2016 Part 11: ''Information and definition schemas'' ([[SQL/Schemata]]). It defines the Information Schema and Definition Schema, providing a common set of tools to make SQL databases and objects self-describing. These tools include the SQL object identifier, structure and integrity constraints, security and authorization specifications, features and packages of ISO/IEC 9075, support of features provided by SQL-based DBMS implementations, SQL-based DBMS implementation information and sizing items, and the values supported by the DBMS implementations.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC 9075-11:2008\" /> This part of the standard contains both ''mandatory and optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-13:2016 Part 13: ''SQL Routines and types using the Java TM programming language'' ([[SQL/JRT]]). It specifies the ability to invoke static Java methods as routines from within SQL applications ('Java-in-the-database'). It also calls for the ability to use Java classes as SQL structured user-defined types. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n* ISO/IEC 9075-14:2016 Part 14: ''XML-Related Specifications'' ([[SQL/XML]]). It specifies SQL-based extensions for using XML in conjunction with SQL. The ''XML'' data type is introduced, as well as several routines, functions, and XML-to-SQL data type mappings to support manipulation and storage of XML in an SQL database.<ref name=\"SQLXML2006\" /> This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n*ISO/IEC 9075-15:2019 Part 15: ''Multi-dimensional arrays'' (SQL/MDA). It specifies a multidimensional array type (MDarray) for SQL, along with operations on MDarrays, MDarray slices, MDarray cells, and related features. This part of the standard consists solely of ''optional'' features.\n\nISO/IEC 9075 is complemented by ISO/IEC 13249 ''SQL Multimedia and Application Packages''. This closely related but separate standard is developed by the same committee. It defines interfaces and packages based on SQL. The aim is a unified access to typical database applications like text, pictures, data mining or [[Georeference|spatial data]].\n\n* ISO/IEC 13249-1:2016 Part 1: ''Framework''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-2:2003 Part 2: ''Full-Text''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 Part 3: ''Spatial''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 Part 5: ''Still image''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-6:2006 Part 6: ''Data mining''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-7:2013 Part 7: ''History''\n* ISO/IEC 13249-8:xxxx Part 8: ''Metadata Registry Access''  [https://www.iso.org/standard/73181.html MRA] (work in progress)\n\nISO/IEC 9075 is also accompanied by a series of Technical Reports, published as ISO/IEC TR 19075 in 8 parts. These Technical Reports explain the justification for and usage of some features of SQL, giving examples where appropriate. The Technical Reports are non-normative; if there is any discrepancy from 9075, the text in 9075 holds. Currently available 19075 Technical Reports are:\n\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-1:2011 Part 1: XQuery Regular Expression Support in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-2:2015 Part 2: SQL Support for Time-Related Information\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-3:2015 Part 3: SQL Embedded in Programs using the Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-4:2015 Part 4: SQL with Routines and types using the Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-5:2016 Part 5: Row Pattern Recognition in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-6:2017 Part 6: SQL support for Javascript Object Notation (JSON)\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-7:2017 Part 7: Polymorphic table functions in SQL\n* ISO/IEC TR 19075-8:2019 Part 8: Multi-Dimensional Arrays (SQL/MDA)<!-- This Part passed its FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot in 2018, but was not published until June, 2019. -->\n\n==Alternatives==\nA distinction should be made between alternatives to SQL as a language, and alternatives to the relational model itself.  Below are proposed relational alternatives to the SQL language.  See [[navigational database]] and [[NoSQL]] for alternatives to the relational model.\n* [[.QL]]: object-oriented Datalog\n* [[4th Dimension (Software)|4D Query Language]] (4D QL)\n* [[Datalog]]: critics suggest that [[Datalog]] has two advantages over SQL: it has cleaner semantics, which facilitates program understanding and maintenance, and it is more expressive, in particular for recursive queries.<ref name=\"PROLE\" />\n* [[HTSQL]]: URL based query method\n* [[IBM Business System 12]] (IBM BS12): one of the first fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982\n* [[ISBL]]\n* [[Java Object Oriented Querying|jOOQ]]: SQL implemented in Java as an [[Domain-specific language|internal domain-specific language]]\n* [[Java Persistence Query Language]] (JPQL): The query language used by the Java Persistence API and [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] persistence library\n* [[JavaScript]]: [[MongoDB]] implements its query language in a JavaScript API.\n* [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]]: Runs SQL statements written like language constructs to query collections directly from inside [[.NET Framework|.Net]] code.\n* [[Object Query Language]]\n* QBE ([[Query By Example]]) created by Mosh\u00e8 Zloof, IBM 1977\n* [[QUEL query languages|Quel]] introduced in 1974 by the U.C. Berkeley Ingres project.\n* [[Tutorial D]]\n* [[XQuery]]\n\n==Distributed SQL processing==\n[[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA) was designed by a work group within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reinsch, R.|title=Distributed database for SAA|journal=IBM Systems Journal|date=1988|volume=27|issue=3|pages=362\u2013389|doi=10.1147/sj.273.0362}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Distributed Relational Database Architecture Reference|date=1990|publisher=IBM Corp. SC26-4651-0}}</ref>\n\nAn interactive user or program can issue SQL statements to a local RDB and receive tables of data and status indicators in reply from remote RDBs. SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in remote RDBs as packages and then invoked by package name. This is important for the efficient operation of application programs that issue complex, high-frequency queries. It is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems.\n\nThe messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]].\n\n==Criticisms==\nChamberlin's 2012 paper<ref name=\"Early History\" /> discusses four historical criticisms of SQL:\n\n===Orthogonality and completeness===\nEarly specifications did not support major features, such as primary keys. Result sets could not be named, and sub-queries had not been defined. These were added in 1992.<ref name=\"Early History\" />\n\n===Null===\nThe concept of [[Null_(SQL)|Null]] is subject of some [[Null_(SQL)#Criticisms|debates]]. The Null marker indicates that there is no value, even no 0 for an integer column or a string of length 0 for a text column. The concept of Nulls enforces the [[Null_(SQL)#Comparisons_with_NULL_and_the_three-valued_logic_(3VL)|3-valued-logic in SQL]], which is a concrete implementation of the general [[Three-valued_logic|3 valued logic]]. \n===Duplicates===\nAnother popular criticism is that it allows duplicate rows, making integration with languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], whose data types might make it difficult to accurately represent the data,<ref name=\"Early History\" /> difficult in terms of parsing and by the absence of modularity.<ref name=\"sqlsucks\">{{cite web|last1=Schauder|first1=Jen|title=Why SQL Sucks|url=http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2010/02/15/why-sql-sucks/|website=Schauderhaft|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis can be avoided declaring a unique constraint with one or more fields that identifies uniquely a row in the table. That constraint could also become the primary key of the table.\n\n===Impedance mismatch===\nIn a similar sense to [[Object-relational impedance mismatch]], there is a mismatch between the declarative SQL language and the procedural languages that SQL is typically embedded in.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Wikipedia books|SQL}}\n* [[Comparison of object-relational database management systems]]\n* [[Comparison of relational database management systems]]\n* [[D (data language specification)]]\n* [[D4 (programming language)]]\n* [[Hierarchical model]]\n* [[List of relational database management systems]]\n* [[MUMPS]]\n* [[NoSQL]]\n* [[Query by Example]]\n* [[Transact-SQL]]\n* [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP)\n* [[Online transaction processing]] (OLTP)\n* [[Data warehouse]]\n*
