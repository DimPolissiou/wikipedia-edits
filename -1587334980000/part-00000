It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed firstly and how to move on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-single-player-review|title=Doom Eternal Single-Player Review|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=April 8, 2020|website=IGN|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145|title=Doom Eternal: The Kotaku Review|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=March 24, 2020|website=Kotaku|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/|title=Doom Eternal Review - Intelligent Inferno|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2020|website=GameSpot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=October 8, 2019|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nEight months after the events on [[Mars]], Earth has been overrun by [[Demons|demonic forces]], wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of the Armored Response Coalition, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests: Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to a destroyed city and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden's robot chassis and the demonic crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden's mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars' core, to which there is no immediate access. The Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars, which he uses to reach Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deags inducted him into the Sentinels, while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy's knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. The Slayer proceeds to kill Deag Grav but is excommunicated from the Sentinals for killing him on sacred ground and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill-fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superhuman abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Slayer Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, [[Heaven|Urdak]], to survive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|title=Doom Eternal--What The Hell Are The Story And Ending About?|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=April 9, 2020|website=Gamespot|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|archive-date=April 11, 2020|access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and halts the awakening ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon's heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. With the dimensional barrier destroyed, the Demons break their pact with the Maykrs and proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell's invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed firstly and how to move on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-single-player-review|title=Doom Eternal Single-Player Review|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=April 8, 2020|website=IGN|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145|title=Doom Eternal: The Kotaku Review|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=March 24, 2020|website=Kotaku|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/|title=Doom Eternal Review - Intelligent Inferno|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2020|website=GameSpot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=October 8, 2019|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nEight months after the events on [[Mars]], Earth has been overrun by [[Demons|demonic forces]], wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of the Armored Response Coalition, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to a destroyed city and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden's robot chassis and the demonic crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden's mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars' core, to which there is no immediate access. The Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars, which he uses to reach Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deags inducted him into the Sentinels, while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy's knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. The Slayer proceeds to kill Deag Grav but is excommunicated from the Sentinals for killing him on sacred ground and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill-fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superhuman abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Slayer Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, [[Heaven|Urdak]], to survive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|title=Doom Eternal--What The Hell Are The Story And Ending About?|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=April 9, 2020|website=Gamespot|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|archive-date=April 11, 2020|access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and halts the awakening ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon's heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. With the dimensional barrier destroyed, the Demons break their pact with the Maykrs and proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell's invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

McKillip]], a sequel to her earlier novel ''[[The Sorceress and the Cygnet]]''. Despite a mixed reception, it was nominated for the 1994 [[Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature]]. It was first published in hardcover by [[Ace Books]] in September 1993, with a paperback following from the same publisher in September 1995. The first British edition was published in paperback by Pan Books in July 1994. It was subsequently combined with ''The Sorceress and the Cygnet'' into the omnibus collection ''Cygnet'', issued in trade paperback by Ace Books in March 2007. It has also been translated into [[French language|French]].<ref name=\"ISFDB\">{{isfdb title|id=2180}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nTwo strangers disrupt the settled life of the inhabitants of Ro Holding, the Hold of the Cygnet, and particularly cousins, Meguet Vervaine, warrior-maid, and Nyx, sorceress and daughter of the Holder Lauro Ro.\n\nMeguet stands guard outside a council meeting when the wily, powerful mage Rad Ilex invades the chamber, seeking an ancient object of power hidden in the castle. Meguet and Nyx are able to resist his spell, and Nyx, ignorant of what the mage is looking for, bars Rad from his search.\n\nAfterwards a magical firebird arrives, whose anguished cries and fiery breath transform people and things into jeweled trees. Moonlight restores them to their original forms, and the firebird to his--that of a tormented, partly amnesiac young man named Brand, son and heir of Draken, half-dragon king of the land of Saphier. Unraveling the mystery of Brand's enchantment and breaking the curse on him become prime goals of the protagonists. \n\nThe thwarted Rad, returning, fights Brand and is wounded. He flees, abducting Meguet. Nyx follows, having found what Rad seeks, a magical key containing the spells of the long-dead wizard Chrysom.\n\nTo save her cousin, free Brand, and learn the cause of Rad and Draken's enmity, Nyx travels to distant Saphier across the eerie, dragon-haunted desert of Luxour, whose slumbering denizens Draken seems intent on awakening.\n\n==Reception==\nCathy Chauvette in ''School Library Journal'' notes that, \"[a]s she did in ''[[The Riddle-Master of Hed|The Riddlemaster of Hed]]'' ... and ''[[The Forgotten Beasts of Eld]]'' ..., McKillip weaves a magic spell of words almost as intoxicating as a drug. The result will depend on readers; some will find its effect addictive, while others will be confused and long for a breath of fresh air. ...
