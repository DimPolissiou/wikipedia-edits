Its erratic path and a lack of nearby weather observations made the hurricane difficult to locate and forecast. The storm later made two [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] in [[Florida]], killing eleven but causing comparatively light damage. Moisture from the storm led to extensive [[flooding]] over the [[Southeastern United States]], particularly along the [[Savannah River]]. Across its path from the Bahamas to the [[mouth (river)|mouth]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], the hurricane killed 155&nbsp;people.\n\nThe storm's origins can be traced to [[tropical wave]] first noted near [[Cabo Verde]] on September&nbsp;11, 1929. This tropical disturbance remained dormant as it tracked west until September&nbsp;18, when an associated area of thunderstorms [[tropical cyclogenesis|developed]] into a [[tropical depression]] northeast of [[Puerto Rico]]. Gradually strengthening, the depression reached [[tropical storm]] strength on September&nbsp;22 and hurricane strength on September&nbsp;23. Beginning on September&nbsp;24, the storm took a slow and southwestward path through the Bahamas, passing over [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and Andros Island between September&nbsp;25\u201326 with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h).{{#tag:ref|[[HURDAT]], the official database for the intensities and tracks of Atlantic tropical cyclones maintained by the [[National Hurricane Center]],<ref name=\"RevisedHURDAT\">{{cite web |last1=Landsea |first1=Chris |last2=Franklin |first2=James |last3=Beven |first3=Jack |title=The revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2) |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-format-atlantic.pdf |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |location=Miami, Florida |format=PDF |date=May 2015}}</ref> lists the [[maximum sustained wind]]s of storms to the nearest five [[knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"AOMLHURDATGuide\">{{cite web |title=Original HURDAT Format |url=https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/hurdat.html |website=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> Conversions to miles per hour (mph) and kilometers per hours (km/h) based on this database are derived from the original value in knots and rounded to the nearest five.|name=note-hurdat|group=nb}} This southwestward trajectory was unprecedented for the islands. The storm then curved west and struck the [[Florida Keys]] at [[Key Largo]] on September&nbsp;28 with winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Two days later, the cyclone moved ashore [[Apalachicola, Florida]], as a minimal hurricane shortly before transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. This system tracked northeast along the interior of the [[East Coast of the United States]] before dissipating near the Saint Lawrence River on October&nbsp;4.\n\nPoorly-built structures and ships were destroyed throughout the Bahamas. Andros Island was within the envelope of the storm's [[hurricane-force]] winds and [[storm surge]] for two days. Parts of the island were inundated by a {{cvt|12|ft|m|adj=on}} surge that advanced {{cvt|20|mi|km}} inland, wiping out all crops and most fruit trees and livestock. A wind gust of {{cvt|164|mph|km/h}} was measured in Nassau, which also experienced the calm of the hurricane's [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] for two hours. An estimated 73% of the city's homes and businesses sustained damage, leaving more than 5,000&nbsp;people without homes. The hurricane was a heavy blow to the declining [[sponge diving|sponge]] industry on the islands. Following the storm, wild birds and crops were brought from the [[Caribbean]] to replenish their losses in the Bahamas. New [[building code]]s were enacted after the 1929&nbsp;storm to prevent similarly extensive destruction.\n\nA {{cvt|6|\u2013|9|ft|m}} storm surge battered the [[Florida Keys]], washing out highways and sinking small fishing boats. At least five [[tornado]]es struck Florida, representing some of the first verified reports of [[List of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes|tornadoes caused by a tropical cyclone]]. One impacted [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]'s business center and caused $100,000 in damage.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1929&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise indicated.|group=nb|name=note-money}} The Apalachicola waterfront sustained heavy damage from the storm's final landfall, including the loss of nearly all wharves. Widespread flooding occurred throughout [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[The Carolinas]] due to the continuous influx of moisture from the slowly-moving hurricane. A maximum rainfall total of {{cvt|20.0|in|mm}} was registered in [[Glennville, Georgia]]. The [[Savannah River]] reached a record [[flood stage|stage]] of {{cvt|46.1|ft|m}} at [[Augusta, Georgia]], breaching a levee and inundating much of the surrounding floodplain. The damage toll in the United States totaled to at least $9.31&nbsp;million.\n\n== Background ==\n[[The Bahamas]] is an archipelago especially vulnerable to [[tropical cyclone]]s due to its position within the [[storm track]]s of Atlantic hurricanes.

Its erratic path and a lack of nearby weather observations made the hurricane difficult to locate and forecast. The storm later made two [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] in [[Florida]], killing eleven but causing comparatively light damage. Moisture from the storm led to extensive [[flooding]] over the [[Southeastern United States]], particularly along the [[Savannah River]]. Across its path from the Bahamas to the [[mouth (river)|mouth]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], the hurricane killed 155&nbsp;people.\n\nThe storm's origins can be traced to [[tropical wave]] first noted near [[Cabo Verde]] on September&nbsp;11, 1929. This tropical disturbance remained dormant as it tracked west until September&nbsp;18, when an associated area of thunderstorms [[tropical cyclogenesis|developed]] into a [[tropical depression]] northeast of [[Puerto Rico]]. Gradually strengthening, the depression reached [[tropical storm]] strength on September&nbsp;22 and hurricane strength on September&nbsp;23. Beginning on September&nbsp;24, the storm took a slow and southwestward path through the Bahamas, passing over [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and Andros Island between September&nbsp;25\u201326 with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h).{{#tag:ref|[[HURDAT]], the official database for the intensities and tracks of Atlantic tropical cyclones maintained by the [[National Hurricane Center]],<ref name=\"RevisedHURDAT\">{{cite web |last1=Landsea |first1=Chris |last2=Franklin |first2=James |last3=Beven |first3=Jack |title=The revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2) |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-format-atlantic.pdf |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |location=Miami, Florida |format=PDF |date=May 2015}}</ref> lists the [[maximum sustained wind]]s of storms to the nearest five [[knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"AOMLHURDATGuide\">{{cite web |title=Original HURDAT Format |url=https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/hurdat.html |website=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> Conversions to miles per hour (mph) and kilometers per hours (km/h) based on this database are derived from the original value in knots and rounded to the nearest five.|name=note-hurdat|group=nb}} This southwestward trajectory was unprecedented for the islands. The storm then curved west and struck the [[Florida Keys]] at [[Key Largo]] on September&nbsp;28 with winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h). Two days later, the cyclone moved ashore [[Apalachicola, Florida]], as a tropical storm shortly before transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. This system tracked northeast along the interior of the [[East Coast of the United States]] before dissipating near the Saint Lawrence River on October&nbsp;4.\n\nPoorly-built structures and ships were destroyed throughout the Bahamas. Andros Island was within the envelope of the storm's [[hurricane-force]] winds and [[storm surge]] for two days. Parts of the island were inundated by a {{cvt|12|ft|m|adj=on}} surge that advanced {{cvt|20|mi|km}} inland, wiping out all crops and most fruit trees and livestock. A wind gust of {{cvt|164|mph|km/h}} was measured in Nassau, which also experienced the calm of the hurricane's [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] for two hours. An estimated 73% of the city's homes and businesses sustained damage, leaving more than 5,000&nbsp;people without homes. The hurricane was a heavy blow to the declining [[sponge diving|sponge]] industry on the islands. Following the storm, wild birds and crops were brought from the [[Caribbean]] to replenish their losses in the Bahamas. New [[building code]]s were enacted after the 1929&nbsp;storm to prevent similarly extensive destruction.\n\nA {{cvt|6|\u2013|9|ft|m}} storm surge battered the [[Florida Keys]], washing out highways and sinking small fishing boats. At least five [[tornado]]es struck Florida, representing some of the first verified reports of [[List of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes|tornadoes caused by a tropical cyclone]]. One impacted [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]'s business center and caused $100,000 in damage.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1929&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise indicated.|group=nb|name=note-money}} The Apalachicola waterfront sustained heavy damage from the storm's final landfall, including the loss of nearly all wharves. Widespread flooding occurred throughout [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[The Carolinas]] due to the continuous influx of moisture from the slowly-moving hurricane. A maximum rainfall total of {{cvt|20.0|in|mm}} was registered in [[Glennville, Georgia]]. The [[Savannah River]] reached a record [[flood stage|stage]] of {{cvt|46.1|ft|m}} at [[Augusta, Georgia]], breaching a levee and inundating much of the surrounding floodplain.
