On October 28, 1944 German troops were driven out by units of the [[Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko Infantry Division]] after five days of fighting in the area of the village.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the town became famous for the production of vegetables, fruit and flowers in greenhouse facilities, the largest in Poland at that time. It was also considered to be the richest town in Poland during that time.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1998, the town was administratively part of Warsaw.\n\n== Major buildings ==\n\n===The Mother of God Queen of Poland Church===\nIn the centre of Jablonna is the Mother of God Queen of Poland Church. It was built by project architect Joseph Sendy\u0144ski on land donated by Count Maurycy Potocki from 1921 to 1925. In 1944, retreating German troops blew up the church, but it was rebuilt by architects Zbigniew Chwalibog and Boleslaw Gierych from 1945 to 1954.\n\n===The Jab\u0142onna Palace===\n[[Jab\u0142onna Palace]] ({{lang-pl|Pa\u0142ac w Jab\u0142onnie}}) is a baroque palace built for [[List of archbishops of Gniezno and primates of Poland|Primate]] [[Micha\u0142 Jerzy Poniatowski]], the brother of King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]. It was built to a design by [[Domenico Merlini]] from 1775 to 1779, and later modified by [[Enrico Marconi]] in 1837.\n\nThe palace is surrounded by an English-style park, created in the 18th century by [[Szymon Bogumi\u0142 Zug]], which includes romantic buildings including a small Chinese house and a conservatory. According to legend, a tunnel exists that passes under the [[Vistula]] River leading to [[Bielany]].<ref>Jacek Szczepa\u0144ski \u201ePowiat Legionowski na dawnej poczt\u00f3wce\u201d str. 25, Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Legionowa, 2002</ref>\n\nThe palace interiors are richly decorated, including paintings by Szymon Ma\u0144kowski's and Antoni Tavellego and stucco by Italian Anotono Bianchi. From 5 to 7 September 1939, the palace housed the headquarters of the [[Modlin Army]]. The palace was burnt down in 1944 and rebuilt after the war.\n\nCurrently, it is a hotel and event centre owned by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n===German fortifications===\nGerman fortifications (three concrete machine gun posts) were built during [[World War II]] at a bend in the Vistula River, about 1&nbsp;km west of the palace's park. Their task was to guard a crossing of the Vistula. In September 1944, German soldiers from 6 SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment \"Theodor Eicke\" and the [[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf]] were based there.\n\nOn October 28, the area was recaptured by the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko Infantry Division. To this day, the positions (in ruins close to the Vistula River) and clear traces of the trenches remain.\n\n===Post Office===\nThe Potocki family leased land in 1837 for use by [[Post riders|mail riders]] and a post office and outbuildings were built. Today, the building is still operated by the Polish [[Poczta Polska|post office]].\n\n===Dr. Stanis\u0142aw Bzury's villa===\nThis is a historic brick villa from the early 20th century, located at 78 Modli\u0144ska Street. It initially belonged to Stanislaw Bzury, the municipal physician and expert [[Viticulture|viticulturist]] (who produced wine for Count [[House of Potocki|Potocki]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.jablonna.pl/gmina/pliki/prezentacja/album///03.pdf |author= |title=Historia Gminy Jab\u0142onna str. 31 |access-date=2012-03-10|language=Polish}}</ref>\n\nA [[Nazi Germany|German]] commandant, in charge of troops guarding the river crossing to Warsaw, used it as his headquarters during World War II.\n==Estate Przylesie==\nEstate Przylesie is lokated on Akademijna road in Jab\u0142onna.There are two bus stops next to the estate. Three bus lines stop at the first stop Os. Przylesie. One zone line 731 and two local lines L41 and L49.

Classes were held from the 1860s. The school was small and taught by a single teacher.\n\nA few years after Poland [[National Independence Day|regained its independence]] there was school in the highest category with a full curriculum taught by 8 teachers and classes were also conducted in private homes.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a wooden school building was erected in Szkolnej (School) Street with 5 classrooms. The building was partially destroyed at the end of World War II but was rebuilt and teaching resumed.\n\nThe continuous increase in the number of students meant that a new building was constructed from 1949 to 1955. The school had 11 classrooms, 14 auxiliary chambers, central heating, running water and sewerage.\n\nOn 9 November 1996, the school was named in honour of the [[Home Army|Armia Krajowa]].\n\n===The White Eagle Gymnasium===\nJunior high schools throughout Poland were closed. Instead, two classes, seventh and eighth, and one in high school were added. Whereas before this gymnasium it was moved to the city of Chotom\u00f3w in the commune of Jab\u0142onna in the Legionowski poviat.\n\n\n==Voluntary Fire Brigade==\nA [[volunteer fire department]] was established in Jab\u0142onna in April 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jablonna.pl/gmina/pliki/wiesci//gazeta_nr_23.pdf |title=Wie\u015bci z naszej gminy.

The first fire truck was an [[Opel Blitz]].\n\nIn 1995, the service was incorporated into the structure of the National Rescue and Fire Fighting System (which was set up to coordinate the activities of the [[State Fire Service|national fire service]] and voluntary brigades). In 2012, it celebrated its 100th anniversary.

{"title_page": "Function space", "text_new": "{{Functions}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''function space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s between two fixed sets. Often, the [[Domain of a function|domain]] and/or [[codomain]] will have additional [[Mathematical structure|structure]] which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set {{var|X}} into a [[vector space]] has a [[List of mathematical jargon#natural|natural]] vector space structure given by [[pointwise]] addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a [[Topological space|topological]] or [[Metric space|metric]] structure, hence the name function ''space''. \n\n==In linear algebra==\n{{See also|Vector space#Function spaces}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Example for addition of functions.svg|thumb|Addition of functions: The sum of the sine and the exponential function is <math>\\sin+\\exp:\\R\\to\\R</math> with <math>(\\sin+\\exp)(x)=\\sin(x)+\\exp(x)</math>]]\n\nLet {{var|V}} be a vector space over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{var|F}} and let {{var|X}} be any set. The functions {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}} can be given the structure of a vector space over {{var|F}} where the operations are defined pointwise, that is, for any {{var|f}}, {{var|g}} : {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}}, any {{var|x}} in {{var|X}}, and any {{var|c}} in {{var|F}}, define\n:<math displaystyle=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\n  (f+g)(x) &= f(x)+g(x) \\\\\n  (c\\cdot f)(x) &= c\\cdot f(x)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nWhen the domain {{var|X}} has additional structure, one might consider instead the [[subset]] (or [[Linear subspace|subspace]]) of all such functions which respect that structure. For example, if {{var|X}} is also vector space over {{var|F}}, the set of [[Linear map|linear maps]] {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}} form a vector space over {{var|F}} with pointwise operations (often denoted [[Hom set|Hom]]({{var|X}},{{var|V}})). One such space is the [[dual space]] of {{var|V}}: the set of [[Linear form|linear functionals]] {{var|V}} \u2192 {{var|F}} with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise.\n\n==Examples==\nFunction spaces appear in various areas of mathematics:\n\n* In [[set theory]], the set of functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' may be denoted ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' or ''Y''<sup>''X''</sup>.\n** As a special case, the [[power set]] of a set ''X'' may be identified with the set of all functions from ''X'' to {0, 1}, denoted 2<sup>''X''</sup>. \n* The set of [[bijection]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted <math>X \\leftrightarrow Y</math>.  The factorial notation ''X''! may be used for permutations of a single set ''X''.\n* In [[functional analysis]] the same is seen for [[continuous function|continuous]] linear transformations, including [[topological vector space|topologies on the vector spaces]] in the above, and many of the major examples are function spaces carrying a [[topology]]; the best known examples include [[Hilbert space]]s and [[Banach space]]s.\n* In [[functional analysis]] the set of all functions from the [[natural number]]s to some set ''X'' is called a [[sequence space]]. It consists of the set of all possible [[sequences]] of elements of ''X''.\n* In [[topology]], one may attempt to put a topology on the space of continuous functions from a [[topological space]] ''X'' to another one ''Y'', with utility depending on the nature of the spaces.  A commonly used example is the [[compact-open topology]], e.g. [[loop space]].

Often, the [[Domain of a function|domain]] and/or [[codomain]] will have additional [[Mathematical structure|structure]] which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set {{var|X}} into a [[vector space]] has a [[List of mathematical jargon#natural|natural]] vector space structure given by [[pointwise]] addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a [[Topological space|topological]] or [[Metric space|metric]] structure, hence the name function ''space''. \n\n==In linear algebra==\n{{See also|Vector space#Function spaces}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Example for addition of functions.svg|thumb|Addition of functions: The sum of the sine and the exponential function is <math>\\sin+\\exp:\\R\\to\\R</math> with <math>(\\sin+\\exp)(x)=\\sin(x)+\\exp(x)</math>]]\n\nLet {{var|V}} be a vector space over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{var|F}} and let {{var|X}} be any set. The functions {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}} can be given the structure of a vector space over {{var|F}} where the operations are defined pointwise, that is, for any {{var|f}}, {{var|g}} : {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}}, any {{var|x}} in {{var|X}}, and any {{var|c}} in {{var|F}}, define\n:<math displaystyle=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\n  (f+g)(x) &= f(x)+g(x) \\\\\n  (c\\cdot f)(x) &= c\\cdot f(x)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nWhen the domain {{var|X}} has additional structure, one might consider instead the [[subset]] (or [[Linear subspace|subspace]]) of all such functions which respect that structure. For example, if {{var|X}} is also vector space over {{var|F}}, the set of [[Linear map|linear maps]] {{var|X}} \u2192 {{var|V}} form a vector space over {{var|F}} with pointwise operations (often denoted [[Hom set|Hom]]({{var|X}},{{var|V}})). One such space is the [[dual space]] of {{var|V}}: the set of [[Linear form|linear functionals]] {{var|V}} \u2192 {{var|F}} with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise.\n\n==Examples==\nFunction spaces appear in various areas of mathematics:\n\n* In [[set theory]], the set of functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' may be denoted ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' or ''Y''<sup>''X''</sup>.\n** As a special case, the [[power set]] of a set ''X'' may be identified with the set of all functions from ''X'' to {0, 1}, denoted 2<sup>''X''</sup>. \n* The set of [[bijection]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted <math>X \\leftrightarrow Y</math>.  The factorial notation ''X''! may be used for permutations of a single set ''X''.\n* In [[functional analysis]] the same is seen for [[continuous function|continuous]] linear transformations, including [[topological vector space|topologies on the vector spaces]] in the above, and many of the major examples are function spaces carrying a [[topology]]; the best known examples include [[Hilbert space]]s and [[Banach space]]s.\n* In [[functional analysis]] the set of all functions from the [[natural number]]s to some set ''X'' is called a [[sequence space]]. It consists of the set of all possible [[sequences]] of elements of ''X''.\n* In [[topology]], one may attempt to put a topology on the space of continuous functions from a [[topological space]] ''X'' to another one ''Y'', with utility depending on the nature of the spaces.  A commonly used example is the [[compact-open topology]], e.g. [[loop space]].

Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, actresses and sports figures. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different rates.\n#'''Definite Loss'''. The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n#'''Accidental Loss'''.  The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance.  The loss should be \u2018pure,\u2019 in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost.  Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.\n#'''Large Loss'''.  The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.  Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.  For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses.  There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n#'''Affordable Premium'''.  If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer.  Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer.  If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance.  (See the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] [[List of FASB Pronouncements|standard number 113]])\n#'''Calculable Loss'''. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n#'''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses'''.  Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-[[catastrophe modeling|catastrophic]], meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 [[Percentage|percent]]. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of [[nanotechnology]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance.</ref> In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint.  Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n==Insurable interest==\n{{Main|Insurable interest}}\n\nInsurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.<ref name=Interest>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Insurable+interest The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest], citing cases at 1 Burr. 489.

Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n#'''Accidental Loss'''.  The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance.  The loss should be \u2018pure,\u2019 in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost.  Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.\n#'''Large Loss'''.  The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.  Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.  For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses.  There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n#'''Affordable Premium'''.  If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer.  Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer.  If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance.  (See the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] [[List of FASB Pronouncements|standard number 113]])\n#'''Calculable Loss'''. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n#'''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses'''.  Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-[[catastrophe modeling|catastrophic]], meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 [[Percentage|percent]]. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of [[nanotechnology]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance.</ref> In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint.  Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n==Insurable interest==\n{{Main|Insurable interest}}\n\nInsurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.<ref name=Interest>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Insurable+interest The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest], citing cases at 1 Burr. 489.

The surrounding ten rock faces have a small number of engravings as well. The rocks consist of [[shale]] and [[hornfels]] oriented toward the north and they shine for a while at sunset. As an overhanging cliff they are in the structure of a rock shelter.\n\n==Description==\nThree hundred and four representations can be seen, of which 166 figures are animals and 108 are unidentified motifs. Representations of [[cetacea]]ns are the most frequent, being 14.4% of the figures. In terms of theme, the representations are either anthropomorphic, depicting the body or face of a human; zoomorphic, showing sea and land animals; hunting and fishing tools; and indeterminate markings whose themes or shapes are hard to identify.\n\nThe engravings of whales and deer were made in most cases by carving out the body, while those of land animals mostly consist of outlines and patterns drawn on the rock surface. Such difference suggest difference in the time of production, given the overlapping relationships of the depictions. At the site, cetaceans are most important, followed by deer and land animals in that order, and there are a small number of turtles, seals, fish, and birds.\n\n===Human figures===\nThe figures are side views of the whole body with a somewhat exaggerated penis or front images of people with mask-like faces spreading their four limbs. There are engravings of people hunting animals with a bow, raising their hands, and playing a long rod like a musical instrument, recalling hunting and religious acts.\n\n===Animal figures===\nShapes and features enable the species to be discriminated. Most of them are whales and concentrated on the left main rock face. [[Ungulate]] mammals like deer and predatory animals like tigers, leopard, and wolves are mainly on the right main rock face. Animals whose species can be identified include large cetaceans such as the [[northern right whale]], the [[humpback whale]], the [[right whale]], the [[gray whale]], and the [[sperm whale]]. There are also sea animals such as sea turtles, seal, salmon-like fish; sea birds; and land animals such as [[red deer]], [[musk deer]], [[roe deer]], [[water deer]], tigers, leopards, wolves, foxes, [[raccoon dog]]s, and [[wild boar]]s.\n\n====Sea animals====\nWhale engravings are in general 20 to 30&nbsp;cm long and between 10 and 80&nbsp;cm high. Most show whales swimming in a group upward as if seen from a bird's-eye view. Sideway engravings of whales are made in a \"twisted method\" in which the tail is carved sideways to show the horizontal tail of the whale, which is different from fish. Other rock art shows a mother whale with her baby on her back, whale jumping scenes, and large cetaceans migrating to and from the remote sea, all vividly depicting whale behaviour. The whale horizontally overturning a boat with its body seems to be dead, and stripes carved on its body are thought to be distribution or breakup lines, resembling ethnographic material describing natives distributing pieces of whale. These engravings are assessed to provide important information about the hunting and subsequent distribution of large animals.\n\nThe three turtles on the upper left of the main rock face appear to be guiding whales swimming in a group. Since sea turtles come to the shore to spawn between early spring and summer, they are often regarded in ancient myth as symbolic animals crossing the boundary of sea and land. In the case of fish, heads of fish looking like sharks are depicted sideways, and there are salmon jumping above the sea surface. On later engravings there is the suggestion of a wooden fence, but since the inner outlines resemble fish and land animals are lacking the possibility of a fishpound has been considered.\n\n====Land animals====\nMost of the land animals are shown in a side view, which can best express the shape of four-limbed land animals. Some species can be classified according to the shape of body, skin patterns, the length of tail and legs, and the shoulder line. These include [[sika deer]], red deer, musk deer, roe deer, and water deer.\n\nSea birds are always placed around whales as they are hunting prey. Some engravings show mating and molt scenes of land animals and because of different patterns and angle of fall suggest the annual change of seasons and the breeding season.\n\n===Tools===\nTools  relating to hunting and fishing such as boats, floats, harpoons, fishing net, fish pounds, and bows provide information on the age of the rock art and livelihood of the time. This site also has scenes of whales and tigers being captured with a net. Although no prehistoric net has yet been excavated, fine marks of net on pottery discovered in the [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden]] suggest that nets were widely used not only for fishing but also for hunting in those days.\n\nThe site has scenes showing whaling activities in great detail. Around 5\u201317 people are on boats surrounding whales. The bows and sterns are semi-circular and are connected to a harpoon stuck into the body of whales and to floats hanging on a rope. The tools are almost identical to those used by natives for whaling today.\n\n===Indeterminate figures===\nEngravings of uncertain theme and content have been classified into two types: those of unknown theme which are in good condition and those of unknown shape which have been worn and damaged over time and are therefore hard to decode. Some have signs with certain patterns, but it is hard to classify them on the basis of engravings on the rock alone. Signs are conceptual expressions that are impossible to find in real life but are repeated expressions of a certain pattern.\n\n==Dating==\nAccording to the results of an analysis of animal bones discovered in a shell midden in Ulsan and widespread along the southeastern coasts and of research on Ulsan Bay's archaeological environment, the site dates back to 7,000 to 3,500 years ago. Many relics related to the themes of the rock art were found at [[Neolithic]] sites, include deer pattern pottery, net pattern pottery and shell mask discovered in the Dongsam-dong Shell Midden in [[Busan]], a figure with human faces in Osan-ri in Yangyang, a small clay wild pig excavated from the shell midden on Yokjido island of [[Tongyeong]], the clay figure of a woman in Sinam-ri in Ulsan, and a small clay seal excavated from the shell midden in Sejuk-ri, Ulsan. Furthermore, a boat was excavated from the shell midden in Bibong-ri, Changnyeong, and during the Hwangseong-dong site excavation research project conducted by the Korea Archaeology and Art History Research Institute a whale bone stuck with a harpoon was found, which empirically proves whaling.\n\nThe layers which contain the bones of captured whales date back to 5500 to 4700 BP. Consequently, considering livelihoods in that period, hunting and fishing tools, related relics, and contemporary contents, the rock art seems to have been made between the early and mid-Neolithic era. Before the site was discovered, the first whaling was thought to have taken place between the 10th and 11th century.\n\nFrom the abundant representations of marine animals, the site seems to be in close relationship with hunter-fishers attributed to the Neolithic era (between 8000 BP and 3500 BP). Consequently, the Bangudae site has the most ancient evidence of whaling worldwide and is considered highly important not only as a first whaling representation, but also for understanding prehistoric maritime culture in the northern Pacific area.\n\n== Preservation concerns ==\nThe Sayeon Dam, built from 1962 to 1965 and expanded between 1999 and 2002, helps supply Ulsan with drinking water but has caused the rocks on which the petroglyphs are carved to be flooded for about eight months of every year. This periodic flooding raises concerns of erosion and water damage of the rock-art motifs, which are considered to be masterpieces of prehistoric art and an invaluable source of prehistoric information. The government of Korea is considering building a polycarbonate \u201cdam\u201d to protect the rock faces.\n\n[[File:Bangudae2.jpg|thumb|Banguda scene, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n[[File:Bangudae3.jpg|thumb|Bangudae rock images, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Prehistoric Korea]]\n* [[Jeulmun pottery period]]\n* [[Mumun pottery period]]\n* [[List of South Korean tourist attractions]]\n* [[National Treasure (South Korea)]]\n\n==References==\n* Lee sangmog \"Chasseurs de baleines - La frise de Bangudae (Cor\u00e9e du Sud)\" Errance, Paris, 2012, ISBN: 978-2877724586\n* [[Kim, Won-yong]].

It is a story of an orphan girl, Suman, who wants to be part of a joint family and soon gets a chance. The show was very popular on Imagine TV and had some of the best their [[target rating point]]s (TRPs).\n\n==Plot==\nThis is the story of a young orphaned woman, whose dreams of finding family and love come true when she gets a chance to be a part of an extremely lovable and traditional joint family.\n\nSuman lives in a girls' hostel with her best friend Kanchan, who hails from a rich, traditional and loving family. Kanchan's mother Kadambari meets Suman and decides that this girl will be her future daughter-in-law. Suman meets Kadambari's son Karan and they take a sudden liking for each other. To Suman's shock, it is revealed that she has been chosen for Karthik, Karan's elder brother. Suman is in a dilemma: She has to choose between her love for Karan and the feelings of a family which has treated her like a daughter.\n\nAfter facing many difficulties, Karan and Suman get married. On the way to their honeymoon, the brakes on their car fail. Karan shoves Suman out but is unable to get out himself. The car dives into a waterfall and Karan is presumed dead. After that, the whole family begins to hate Suman, except for Karthik and his new fianc\u00e9e Nandini. But even Nandini becomes an enemy when she sees that Karthik cares for Suman. Karthik marries Nandini. But their marriage breaks up when Nandini's evil nature is exposed before the whole family.\n\nMeanwhile, Suman goes through many trials and tribulations. After a long time, she is once again accepted by her in-laws. By now, she and Karthik are in love. They get married with the blessings of the family. Just then, Karan comes back, alive. When he learns about Suman's re-marriage with Karthik, he is very angry. He tries to break up their relationship but fails. Later, Karan marries a young woman named Paro and is happy with her.\n\nFate plays another trick on Suman. A young widow related to Suman's father-in-law comes to stay with the family. This woman is attracted to Karthik. She makes it appear that he has outraged her modesty under the influence of a drug. Then she pretends to be expecting his child. Karthik is forced to promise that he will marry her. The woman kidnaps Suman and kills her. Suman's spirit comes back, however, and exposes her killer before leaving the world. Karthik and his family are heartbroken at losing Suman. A few years later, there is another Suman in the family \u2013 Karan and Paro's little daughter.

[[Warner Bros.]] through its International Television unit that focuses on airing [[United States|American]] series and films.\n\nMost programming air in their original [[English language|English]] audio, with subtitles in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (for Latin American countries except Brazil), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (for Brazil), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore),  [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] (for Malaysia) and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (for Indonesia), however, there are also some [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] programming. On November 1, 2015, the Latin American channel switched to dub programming instead of just subtitling them. This caused an uproar to most of its audience.\n\nWarner TV's headquarters are located in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Chile]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]]; the broadcasting, however, is based in [[Miami]] for Latin American viewers and Singapore for Asian viewers.

The institute was renamed \"Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology\" in 2002.\n\n== Achievements ==\nIn 2009, a team at the institute sequenced the [[genome]] of the wild-type [[zebrafish]], with about 1.7 billion base pairs. This made the fish, which is native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, the first [[vertebrate]] to have its whole genome sequenced in India, as previously Indian scientists had only sequenced bacteria and plant genomes.<ref>[http://genome.igib.res.in Zebrafish Genome Webpage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719084933/http://genome.igib.res.in/ |date=19 July 2018 }} 'Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology' (IGIB)</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 Decoding the Genome Mystery] [[Indian Express]], 5 July 2009.</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, scientists at IGIB performed the first re-sequencing of a human genome in India.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/videoie.php?videoId=201 Indian Scientists decode human genome] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 10 December 2009 {{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref><ref>* {{cite journal | vauthors = Patowary A, Purkanti R, Singh M, Chauhan RK, Bhartiya D, Dwivedi OP, Chauhan G, Bharadwaj D, Sivasubbu S, Scaria V | display-authors = 6 | title = Systematic analysis and functional annotation of variations in the genome of an Indian individual | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1133\u201340 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22461382 | doi = 10.1002/humu.22091 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1ae5df6593be12ff639126b640670bd72cef364 }} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22091/pdf]</ref><ref>[http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/indian-genome Compilation of news articles and Press releases on Indian Genome], 10 December 2009</ref> The Institute also collaborated on decoding the first Sri Lankan <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ |title=Sri Lankan genome  |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218040054/http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ |archive-date=18 February 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |  vauthors = Dissanayake VH, Samarakoon PS, Scaria V, Patowary A, Sivasubbu S, Gokhale RS | title=The Sri Lankan Personal Genome Project: an overview. | journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Biomedical Informatics | volume=1| issue=2 | year=2012| pages=4\u20138 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405005110/http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073 |date=5 April 2013 }}</ref> genome and Malaysian genome.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://promiseuitm.org/component/content/article/34-slideshow/50-the-first-malay-genome.html | title=Wedding Day Ancilleries }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Institute is also a member of the Open Personal Genomics Consortium.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://openpgx.org/ |title=OpenPGx Consortium |access-date=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218064848/http://www.openpgx.org/ |archive-date=18 December 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Genomics of rare genetic diseases ==\nThe institute has initiated a unique programme to use cutting edge genomic technologies to understand Rare [[genetic diseases]] in India and pioneering the application of genomics for [[Precision Medicine]] in clinics.

Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored.

Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed.

He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.\"<ref>Jayson Stark (February 16, 2006).

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to [[spring training]], where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with [[Nelson Cruz]], [[Jason Botts]], and other rookies/prospects.<ref>T. R.

He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in [[Champion Stadium|The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], a usually minor-league and [[Spring training]] park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of [[Jason Marquis]] during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009.

However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball.

On January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) into baseball's Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown]], receiving 12.5% on his first year on the ballot (the requirement for election is 75%). For the elections of 2014 through 2016 he received 7.2%, 6.6%, and 7.0%. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA. \n\nOn October 2, 2016 at a press conference at [[Fenway Park]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] said that anonymous drug tests from 2003 were inconclusive because \"it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.\"<ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17706532/david-ortiz-says-did-wrong-03-failed-drug-test|title=Manfred: Possible Ortiz was PED-free in '03|publisher=}}</ref> Manfred argued that \"it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive\".<ref name=\"vocativ.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/364281/david-ortiz-retirement/|title=David Ortiz Gets A Steroid Hall Pass From MLB's Commissioner|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on \"leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results\".<ref name=\"espn.com\"/> Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many \"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives.\"<ref name=\"vocativ.com\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSosa is married to Sonia Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican TV dancer as a child,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=H\u00e9ctor J.|title=\u00c9l tambi\u00e9n es un humano, no lo olviden|url=http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|access-date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[List\u00edn Diario]]|date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701193035/http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|archivedate=July 1, 2016|language=Spanish|at=Note: The vedettes of the TV program \"{{illm|S\u00e1bado de Corpor\u00e1n|es}}\" were known as \"corporette\".|url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he has six children: Keysha, Kenia, Sammy Jr., Michael, Kalexy and Rolando.

The buzz around this drastic change prompted him to go on a Spanish-language television station to deny that he was ill, or that he hated being dark-skinned, or that his new skin tone was the result of steroid use.

After playing for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Chicago White Sox]], Sosa joined the Cubs in 1992 and became regarded as one of the game's best hitters. Sosa hit his 400th home run in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, reaching this milestone quicker than any player in [[National League]] history.

He also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting 2 home runs and driving in 5 runs. However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.\n\n===Chicago Cubs (1992&ndash;2004)===\nThe White Sox traded Sosa and [[Ken Patterson]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[outfielder]] [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] before the 1992 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/03/score-20-flashback-1-white-sox-trade-sosa-to-cubs-for-bell/|title=Flashback #1: White Sox Trade Sosa To Cubs For Bell (1992)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSosa batted .260 with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored.

Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-[[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a [[corked bat]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0603/1562772.html Sosa ejected after cork is found in shattered bat.] (June 4, 2003) ESPN.com.

He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.\"<ref>Jayson Stark (February 16, 2006).

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to [[spring training]], where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with [[Nelson Cruz]], [[Jason Botts]], and other rookies/prospects.<ref>T. R.

Accessed June 5, 2007.</ref> Sosa was successful during spring training and was added to the team's 25-man roster. He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in [[Champion Stadium|The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], a usually minor-league and [[Spring training]] park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of [[Jason Marquis]] during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009. Sosa said that he had been keeping in shape at his home, and was hoping that after a strong World Baseball Classic he would prove to major-league teams that he was still capable of playing in the MLB. However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball. He made the announcement in the Dominican Republic and said that he was calmly looking forward to his induction into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] since his statistics were up to par.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4229022 Sammy Sosa planning to announce formal retirement] ESPN</ref>\n\n==Drug test controversy and Hall of Fame==\n{{see|doping in baseball}}\nOn June 16, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Sosa was on a list of players who had tested positive for [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States| performance-enhancing drugs]] in 2003, in baseball's [[doping in baseball|steroids scandal]].

On January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) into baseball's Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown]], receiving 12.5% on his first year on the ballot (the requirement for election is 75%). For the elections of 2014 through 2016 he received 7.2%, 6.6%, and 7.0%. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA. \n\nOn October 2, 2016 at a press conference at [[Fenway Park]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] said that anonymous drug tests from 2003 were inconclusive because \"it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.\"<ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17706532/david-ortiz-says-did-wrong-03-failed-drug-test|title=Manfred: Possible Ortiz was PED-free in '03|publisher=}}</ref> Manfred argued that \"it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive\".<ref name=\"vocativ.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/364281/david-ortiz-retirement/|title=David Ortiz Gets A Steroid Hall Pass From MLB's Commissioner|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on \"leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results\".<ref name=\"espn.com\"/> Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many \"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives.\"<ref name=\"vocativ.com\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSosa is married to Sonia Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican TV dancer as a child,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=H\u00e9ctor J.|title=\u00c9l tambi\u00e9n es un humano, no lo olviden|url=http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|access-date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[List\u00edn Diario]]|date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701193035/http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|archivedate=July 1, 2016|language=Spanish|at=Note: The vedettes of the TV program \"{{illm|S\u00e1bado de Corpor\u00e1n|es}}\" were known as \"corporette\".|url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he has six children: Keysha, Kenia, Sammy Jr., Michael, Kalexy and Rolando.
