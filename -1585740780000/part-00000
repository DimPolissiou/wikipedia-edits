In ''[[Twilight Princess]]'' it is revealed to be part of a mountain range in the Eldin Province called the Eldin Mountains. The main inhabitants of Death Mountain are the Gorons, a race of rock-eating [[giant]]s that mine the mountains in search of food and the mountains are littered with caves as a result of the Goron's [[mining]] activities.\n*'''Spectacle Rock''' (\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u30a4\u30ef Megane Iwa) is a location consisting of two large rock formations next to each other that resemble a pair of eyeglasses.

Only a few mountaintops are still visible above the water, and these form the islands and [[archipelago]]s of the Great Sea. Due to the relatively small size of the many islands, the large expanses of ocean between each island require the player to use charts to navigate from island to island. On the islands of the Great Sea, local [[commerce]] is shown to be quite advanced. Most food is gathered from fishing and small farms, though there are also active merchant, salvage, and shipbuilding businesses.\n*{{Nihongo|'''Hyrule Castle'''|\u30cf\u30a4\u30e9\u30eb\u57ce|Hairaru-j\u014d}} is the home of Hyrule's royal family.

Below the clouds lies \"the Surface\". Found on the Surface are several locations visited in games that take place after the events of ''Skyward Sword'': \"Faron Woods\" (shown in ''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''), \"Lake Floria\" (''Breath of the Wild''), \"Eldin\" (''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''), \"Eldin Volcano\" (implied to be Death Mountain), and the arid \"Lanayru Desert\", which is seen as a fecund region in ''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''.

It is one of the few weapons capable of harming [[Ganon]] and a key to the Sacred Realm. First introduced in ''[[A Link To The Past]]'', it has the power to \"repel evil\", which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and evil beings and keep them from using the sword. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', the blade originally began as the Goddess Sword, which has a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Eventually, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbs Demise's remains.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/16/e3-2010-nintendo-developer-roundtable-live-blog E3 2010: Nintendo Developer Roundtable Live Blog]. [[IGN]], June 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe sword traditionally rests in [[wiktionary:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] locations indigenous to [[#Hyrule|Hyrule]], such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to [[Arthurian legend]], the Master Sword is often obtained by [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|pulling it from a stone pedestal]]. The sword is often not at full power, leading it to need to be \"recharged\" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in ''[[A Link to the Past]]'', it was tempered to the Tempered Sword. It can later be upgraded to the Golden Sword. Similarly, in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce.<ref>[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], King of Red Lions: The fact that the Master Sword lost the power to repel evil suggests to me that something has happened to the sages who infused the blade with the gods\u2019 power. The sages should be in Hyrule...  in the Wind Temple to the north and the Earth Temple to the south, praying to the gods.</ref> In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'' the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged becoming temporarily unusable. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods. Zelda moved it there to be guarded by the Great Deku Tree and to protect knowledge of its location from Calamity Ganon. Link can travel to the Korok Forest at any point after receiving the Paraglider, though he can only remove the sword after obtaining 13 or more Heart Containers, as removing it drains Link's hearts as a way to test his strength. In addition to its unbreakability, Link can also fire Sword Beams while he is at full health. The Master Sword has a base damage of 30 but its true power glows when in the presence of pools of Calamity Ganon's Malice, Cursed Enemies, and all of Calamity Ganon's various forms; its durability is greatly increased in this state. It can later be enhanced to 60 damage once completing the \"trial of the sword\" side quest.\n\nOnce removed, Link sees a vision of Zelda entrusting the Master Sword to the protection of the Great Deku Tree 100 years ago. During her conversation with him, Princess Zelda reveals that the sword spoke to her (which is implied to be Fi, whose consciousness apparently still exists within the sword though unable to manifest her spirit form) and told her that her destiny was not finished and that she still had something she must do, leading to Princess Zelda's sealing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle for 100 years while Link slept. The weapon's in-game description reveals that the sword is delighted to be in Link's possession, echoing Fi's words at the end of ''Skyward Sword''. 100 years after Calamity Ganon was sealed in Hyrule Castle, the sword became known across Hyrule as the Sword that Seals the Darkness and is sought by several travelers Link encounters despite the fact that only the chosen hero can wield its power.\n\nThe Master Sword is a [[Arming sword|double-edged one-handed sword]]. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]. On the flats of the blade near the [[hilt]] is a [[Triforce]] symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a blue or purple curved [[Guard (weapon)|crossguard]] in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. Since ''The Wind Waker'', the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the [[Wise old man|sages]] in the mid-game. In ''Breath of the Wild'', this glow represents the Master Sword's true power. ''Breath of the Wild'' is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state.\n\n[[Nintendo Power]] listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming: citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=44 |title-link=Nintendo Power }}</ref>\n\n===Triforce===\n{{main|Triforce}}\n[[File:Triforce.svg|thumb|210px|The Triforce is represented as three conjoined golden triangles, with one triangle placed above the other two.]]\nThe {{nihongo|Triforce|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Toraif\u014dsu}}, also called {{nihongo|\"Power of the Gods\"|\u795e\u306e\u529b|Kami no Chikara}} and the {{nihongo|\"Golden Triangle\"|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u5927\u4e09\u89d2|\u014cgon no Dai-Sankaku}}, is a triangular sacred [[relic]] left behind by the three [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Golden Goddesses]] when they created Hyrule.

These embody the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|their respective goddesses]], and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers as a result.\n\nWhen united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic they value most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters \"chosen by destiny\". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.\n\nThe Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with [[Ganon]], who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with [[Princess Zelda]], whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.\n\n==Other worlds==\n===Termina===\n{{nihongo|Termina|\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30ca|Tarumina}} is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''. Link falls into this world from a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule, and many of its citizens have identical names and appearances to (although different personalities from) people in Hyrule. The land itself is split into four distinct regions, one for every compass direction, and each guarded by four giant deities: The [[swamp]]y Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; The icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east.

It is similar to Hyrule in geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda's Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce and was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link, and Hilda's former servant Ravio manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from ''Twilight Princess'', ''The Phantom Hourglass'', and ''A Link to the Past'', respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. In ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'', Link travels to Labrynna and Holodrum. ''Triforce Heroes'' is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite web |quote= Hyrule and Hytopia are connected. |author=Tri Force Heroes developers |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/NintendoHandheldGaming/photos/a.150955828309750.40686.149152295156770/953796588025666/?type=3 |title=Most games in The Legend of Zelda series have a connection to Hyrule. Does the land of Hytopia connect to Hyrule in any way? |website=Facebook}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Races==\n===Ancient Robots===\nThe {{nihongo|Ancient Robots|RS-301}} are a mechanical race from ''Skyward Sword''. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone they can be revived and serve three purposes. Some of them mine for Timeshift Stones, one group protected one of the Sacred Flames, and some act as Lanayru's servants. In addition there is a band of Ancient Robot Pirates, though only two of them are seen: LD-002S Scervo on the Sandship, and LD-003D Dreadfuse in the Sky Keep. During Link's quest for Nayru's Flame, Link is aided by a robot named Skipper, who is captain of the Sandship and lost his ship to the Pirate Scervo. Skipper aids Link in traversing the Lanayru Sand Sea using his Timeshift Stone powered motorboat, which can transform the impassible sea of sand into the ancient sea of water that once existed in the past. Also, Gondo, one of the citizens of Skyloft, owns an Ancient Robot that he inherited from his grandfather; at one point in the game this robot, named Scrapper, is restored to full functionality, and assists Link by carrying items up to Skyloft from the surface. The Ancient Robots require the oil produced by Ancient Flowers to function; because these flowers can no longer be found in the present day Lanayru Desert, it is implied that the flower's disappearance resulted in the decline of the LD-301 Series Ancient Robots. Most ancient robots are part of the LD-301 Series, including LD-301S Scrapper and LD-301N Skipper, while Servo and Dreadfuse are part of the LD-002 and LD-003 series, which unlike the LD-301 Series remain functional in the present.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', similar robots exist called Guardians and Divine Beasts. The Divine Beasts consist of Vah Ruta of the Zora, Vah Rudania of the Gorons, Vah Naboris of the Gerudo, and Vah Medoh of the Rito. The Guardians are ancient mechanisms with powerful sniper blasts who were intended to be used to defeat Ganon, but Ganon used his power to turn the robots against Hyrule. Mipha, the Zora Champion, Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion, Daruk, the Goron Champion, and Revali, the Rito Champion, who once piloted the Divine Beasts, were killed by the Blight Ganons, creations of Ganon who represent the element of the Divine Beast e.g. Thunderblight Ganon for Vah Naboris.\n\n===Anouki===\n{{nihongo|Anouki|\u30e6\u30ad\u30ef\u30ed\u30b7|Yukiwaroshi}} are an Inuit-like race that appear to be a cross between a reindeer and penguins. There are different variations of them with purple, red, blue, and yellow shirts and facial hair or small or big antlers. They are found on the Isle of Frost in the World of Ocean King and in Anouki Village in New Hyrule. In ''Spirit Tracks'', the Anouki are the only race who live in the snow realm.\n\n===Bokoblin===\nBokoblins are a race of humanoid [[goblin]]-like creatures, that first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and wield Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In ''Twilight Princess'', they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In ''Skyward Sword'', Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield ancient technology; and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. The game introduces the bow-wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of weapons, but tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows, the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continuously regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed, because a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins, which are stronger and more resilient. Cursed Bokoblins return in ''Breath of the Wild,'' but are depicted as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice.\n\nRed Bokoblins and Stalkoblins drop Bokoblin Horns and Bokoblin Fangs, while Blue, Black, and Silver Bokoblins drop those parts along with Bokoblin Guts. These monster parts can be sold to shops and merchants for Rupees or to Kilton for ''Mon'' at the Fang and Bone shop, though Link can also cook them with bugs to make Elixirs or use them as materials by the four Great Fairies to upgrade his armor. Link can also buy a Bokoblin Mask from Kilton, which allows him to disguise himself as a Bokoblin and blend in with them.\n\n===Bulblin===\n{{nihongo|Bulblins|\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Buruburin}} are a green, horned race that resemble the [[orc]]s of classic fantasy. They are led by {{nihongo|King Bulblin|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Kingu Buruburin}},<ref name=\"BulblinTrophy\"><!--\"Creatures that serve under King Bulblin.

When he loses in his final battle, he pays subtle respect to Link when he says, 'I follow the strongest side!'\". [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Trophy description of the \"King Bulblin\" trophy.</ref> Bulblins usually fight with heavy clubs or flaming arrows and commonly ride on boars. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' King Bulblin appears as an obstacle in the Bridge of Eldin stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.\n\n===Cobble===\nThe Cobble are a race that appear in ''Phantom Hourglass''. The Cobble once inhabited a prosperous land called the Cobble Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only Cobble that remain are the ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress in ancient Egyptian-like clothes and live in pyramid-like temples. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is all that remains of the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the Cobble by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt Cobble war machine that is disrupting the king's eternal rest.\n\n===Deku===\nThe {{nihongo|Deku|\u30c7\u30af\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4|Dekunattsu}} are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' that appear mostly in the [[overworld]] and dungeons. Deku are small creatures with leaves sprouting out from their heads. They often have red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. Their bodies consist of wood and leaves and perish quickly if set on fire. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs. Deku Scrubs are the most common type, which have green leaves and often give information when caught. Mad Scrubs are violent, have red and yellow leaves, and do not talk. Business Scrubs are traders who offer to sell their wares and services. Royal Scrubs have larger heads, bigger eyes, smaller mouths, and extra leaves covering their body. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of an unknown deceased Deku Scrub who is  implied to be the son of the Deku King's butler. In this form, Link can temporarily fly using a Deku Flower, shoot bubbles, and hop on deep water five times before sinking.\n\n===Dragon===\n[[Dragon]]s are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia's ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he could not locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In ''The Wind Waker'', the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the protector and patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo, and defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In ''Skyward Sword'', Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. During his quest for Farore's Flame, Link aids Faron, who had been injured while fighting Ghirahim; she leads him to the Ancient Cistern. During his quest for the Song of the Hero, Link encounters Eldin after he is captured and imprisoned by Bokoblins during an eruption. Link learns that the Fire Dragon had caused the eruption, and the dragon apologizes to Link for all the trouble it caused him. Unlike the other two dragons, Lanayru is shown to have died from an illness in the past, forcing Link to go back in time, cure him of his illness, and prevent his death. After Link cures him and learning his part of the song, Lanayru allows Link to take part in the Lightning Round, which allows him to face a boss battle challenge and a Silent Realm challenge for various prizes. If Link completes eight boss battles, Lanayru will reward him with the unbreakable Hylian Shield, the strongest shield in the game.\n\n===Fairy===\n{{nihongo|[[Fairy|Fairies]]|\u5996\u7cbe|[[Y\u014dsei]]}} are magical creatures associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that appear as small, winged [[humanoid]]s often obscured by light. Fairies tend to shy away from human settlements and are most often associated with the Lost Woods, but can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule. Fairy Fountains or Fairy Springs are special places that contain sparkling magical water and attract Fairies in large numbers. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one and he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him instead of receiving a [[Game Over]].\n\n{{nihongo|Great Fairies|\u5927\u5996\u7cbe|Dai-y\u014dsei}} are powerful, high ranking fairies that often watch over their smaller brethren. They use their magic to enchant Link's items into more powerful versions and in some games they can also teach Link various magic spells. In ''Ocarina of Time'', the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their Guardian Fairies, who act as constant companions and mentors. One of these is [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]], who serves as Link's sidekick and aids Link in learning about the world outside Kokiri Forest. Another Guardian Fairy is Tatl from ''Majora's Mask'' who was a friend of the Skull Kid until he betrayed her and her brother Tael. In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as ''The Minish Cap'', players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], fairies can be found around the springs of the four great fairies. There is a fifth fairy named Malayna, but she is not a Great Fairy; instead, she is known as the Horse God and can revive dead horses. Fairies can be used to cook potions and other food; if they are used in making a dish, they increase the amount of hearts the food heals before disappearing from the player's inventory.\n\n===Gerudo===\nThe {{nihongo|Gerudo|\u30b2\u30eb\u30c9}} are a tribe of humanoid [[Theft|thieves]] who mainly live in the desert. Physical Gerudo traits typically include bronzed skin, scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold eyes and round ears; however, evil Gerudo like Ganondorf and the Twinrova Sisters possess an olive skin color. Gerudo sentries carry [[pole weapon|polearms]] reminiscent of the Japanese ''[[naginata]]''. Apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century and is crowned king of the tribe, the race consists entirely of women.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Nabooru: \"A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years\u2026 Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!\"</ref> [[Ganon]]dorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo in ''Ocarina of Time'' and the surrogate son of the twin Gerudo witch sisters Kotake and Koume. Gerudo appear as pirates in ''Majora's Mask'', where they live in the ocean at Great Bay, and are ruled by a woman instead of a man.  These Gerudo are enemies of the Zoras. They search for treasures in the sea and assault Zora and fishermen but do not approach Clock Town. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', only women are permitted in the town, so [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] has to [[crossdress]] as a female in order to enter the town. After gaining entrance to Gerudo Town, Link has to retrieve a thunder-resistant helmet known as the Thunder Helm from a clan of thieves called the Yiga, a traitorous formation who broke away from the Sheikah tribe. The helm is used to board Vah Naboris, named after the Sage of Spirit, Nabooru, as stated by the spirit of former Gerudo Champion Urbosa.\n\n===Goron===\n[[File:Goron.JPG|thumb|A Goron, as seen in ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'']]\nThe {{nihongo|Goron|\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3}} are a race of mountain-dwelling [[giant]]s who first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as \"Brother\" or \"Big Brother\". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as [[sumo wrestling]]<ref><!--\"They like sumo wrestling\"-->In-game trophy description of a \"Goron\" from [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008).</ref> and [[racing]]. While not all ''Zelda'' games featuring Gorons include full tribes, the games that do depict as tribes depict them as headed by a [[patriarch]] who is aided by one or more elders who assume leadership of the tribe in the event that the patriarch cannot. {{nihongo|Darunia|\u30c0\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2}} is the patriarch in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Goron elders in ''Twilight Princess'' are {{nihongo|Gor Coron|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Don Kor\u014dne}}, {{nihongo|Gor Amoto|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Don S\u012bgeru}} {{nihongo|Gor Ebizo|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30d3\u30fc\u30be|Don Eb\u012bzo}}, and {{nihongo|Gor Liggs|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30b2\u30fc\u30cc|Don Reg\u0113nu}}.\n\nOne of the oldest races in Hyrule, Gorons' bodies are resistant to intense heat and lava and they consume rocks and minerals,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', Goron figurine: \"These rock- and iron-eaters once lived on Mount Crenel in Western Hyrule.\"</ref><ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \"You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all of your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and strong!\"</ref> which they mine from the earth. By adulthood, most Gorons gain rock-like protrusions on their backs and sometimes on their arms and head as well. These stony growths act as a natural armor and continue to grow as the Goron ages. Gorons enter the [[fetal position]] when resting, and can also assume this position for self defense or to travel at high speed by [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|rolling]]. Gorons endowed with magic power can sprout metal spikes from their body while rolling.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani's memorial: \"If Gorons who possess magic power roll swiftly enough, spikes will emerge from their bodies so that they may mow down enemies.\"</ref>\n\nFor leisure, Gorons enjoy music and dance, rolling and racing,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \u201cThis wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!\u201d [\u2026] \u201cLet me express my joy with more wild rolling!\u201d</ref> games,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages'', Goron: \"We Gorons love games!\"</ref> sumo wrestling, and bathing in hot springs. Gorons have taken on occupations such as crafting, blacksmithing, sculpting, demolition, and merchantry. Rock sirloin, [[amber]], and metal shields are some Goron delicacies.\n\nThree Gorons appear in ''Skyward Sword:'' Gorko, Golo, and Gortram. Gorko and his assistant Golo, are shown working as archaeologists; Gorko travels the land researching ancient artifacts and ruins, while Golo excavates the Lanayru Caves. Unlike the other two, Gortram works as the proprietor of the Rickety Coaster mine cart ride at the abandoned Lanayru Shipyards. All three Gorons are encountered in the Lanayru Desert region at some point and the Lanayru Caves seems to serve as the base of operations for Gorko and Golo.\n\nGorons are large humanoids with long muscular arms, stout legs, hulking shoulders and necks, and rotund bellies. Their skin is generally beige in color and their hair is typically white. Gorons lack external hearing organs; Goron ears are instead holes on the sides of their heads. Most are as tall as a human, though some individuals such as {{nihongo|Biggoron|\u30c0\u30a4\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3|Daigoron}} can grow as large as a mountain. To date, no female Gorons have been seen in the series, but they do exist, as child and baby Gorons do appear and Darunia has a son during the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. Due to their great density, Gorons sink to the bottom of bodies of water and are thus helpless in such an environment. However, they do not need to breath to survive, as a Goron child proves by resting underwater and mentioning that he never feels the need to take a breath. Also, in ''Twilight Princess'', a Goron becomes submerged in the main pool in Zora's Domain, but enjoys the cold water rather than drowning.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani III's memorial: \"Water is disastrous for Goron heroes, for they sink like stones and are rendered motionless in the deep. Beware.\"</ref> Gorons are exceptionally resistant to heat and can walk through shallow [[lava]].\n\nIn ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of the deceased Goron hero Darmani and roll and punch as hard as the Megaton Hammer from ''Ocarina of Time.''\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the Gorons are encountered all over Hyrule, but mostly appear in the Eldin region. They live around Death Mountain, which Link must use heat-resistant armor or elixirs to enter.\n\n===Hylian===<!-- In the official game they call them \"Hylians\". They also call them this on Zelda Universe. (Nintendo's official website) -->\n{{Redirect|Hylian|the language|#Hylian language}}\n{{nihongo|Hylians|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u65cf|Hairia-zoku}} are an [[elf]]-like race that make up the main population of Hyrule, which they established organized civilization on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |title=Zelda Universe |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075201/http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |archive-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|the goddesses]] that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. Link and Princess Zelda belong to this race in all games of the series. In some games, such as ''Twilight Princess'', Hylians are referred to as \"humans\". In ''Skyward Sword'', Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings.\n\n===Keaton===\n{{nihongo|Keaton|\u30ad\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3|K\u012btan}} are a three-tailed fox-like race mostly found in Termina. They normally stay hidden from sight, but reveal themselves to Link and challenge him with a quiz if he wears a Keaton Mask. No known Keaton exist in Hyrule in ''Ocarina of Time'', although at least one of them is a well-known fictional character in Hyrule Castle Town.<ref name=\"Keaton-1\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'': \"Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!\"</ref><ref name=\"Keaton-2\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Death Mountain Guard: \"Oh? Is that a \"Kee...something...\" character mask? I heard he's very popular recently? He's my boy's favorite.\"</ref> In ''The Minish Cap'', however, some thuggish Keaton roam the Hyrule countryside, walking on their hindpaws and having only one tail instead of three; if they injure Link, he loses some Rupees.\n\n===Kikwi===\nThe {{nihongo|Kikwi|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a4\u65cf|Kyui-zoku}} are a race in ''Skyward Sword'' who inhabit the Faron Woods. They have the appearance of black-and-white masked wingless birds, and can cause a plant to blossom from their backs for camouflage.\n\n===Kokiri and Koroks===\nThe {{nihongo|Kokiri|\u30b3\u30ad\u30ea\u65cf|Kokiri-zoku}} are a [[pixie]]-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They were created by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. They do not age once they grow up into kids. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe that they will die if they leave the forest.<ref>'': Ocarina of Time'', Kokiri boy: \"The Great Deku Tree said that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!\"</ref> This belief seems to be false, as Saria leaves the forest when she becomes the Forest Sage. It is also suggested that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid, although this has not been proven definitively.\n\nA Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in ''The Wind Waker'', but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in ''Ocarina of Time'', but he is actually a Hylian whose mother entrusted the Great Deku Tree with his care when he was an infant. It wasn't until he traveled into the future when getting the Master Sword that Link found out he wasn't a Kokiri by aging.\n\nThe {{nihongo|Koroks|\u30b3\u30ed\u30b0|Korogu}} of ''The Wind Waker'' are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood.<ref name=\"Kokiri forms\">''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', Great Deku Tree: \"Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes.\"</ref> They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the \"Forest Haven\", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. The player must solve puzzles to get Korok Seeds from them. Once the player retrieves Korok Seeds from Koroks, one can trade it with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for swords, shields, and bows.\n\n===Light Spirits===\nThere are four {{nihongo|Light Spirits|\u5149\u306e\u7cbe\u970a|Hikari no Seirei}} throughout Hyrule in ''Twilight Princess''.\n\nThe first light spirit is {{Nihongo|Ordona|\u30e9\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30cc|Rato\u0101nu}}, who resembles an Ordon Goat. Ordona has an orb between her antlers and first appears at Ordon Spring when Link has defeated the first Shadow Beast.\n\nThe second light spirit, {{nihongo|Faron|\u30d5\u30a3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Fir\u014dne}}, resembles a monkey. He holds his golden orb with his tail over his head. He appears in Faron Spring when Link has completed the first collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe third light spirit, {{nihongo|Eldin|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Orudin}}, resembles an eagle with his orb between his feet. He appears in the lake near the shaman's house in Kakariko Village once Link has completed the second collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe fourth and last light spirit, {{nihongo|Lanayru|\u30e9\u30cd\u30fc\u30eb|Ran\u0113ru}}, resembles a serpent with his orb inside his mouth. He appears in the cave at Lake Hylia when Link has completed the third and final collection of twilight bugs. But after Lanayru tells Link the story of the three goddesses and the three Fused Shadows, Zant appears and embeds the Shadow Crystal in Link's skull that later allows him to transform between his human and wolf form. He also exposes Midna to Lanayru's light causing her to become very ill and sends Link on the quest for the Master Sword.\n\n===Lokomo===\n{{nihongo|Lokomos|\u30ed\u30b3\u30e2|Rokomo}} are a humanoid race who first appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]''. All but one of the encountered Lokomo are sages who reside in the New Hyrule and the Tower of Spirits. They are distinguishable by their pointed ears and short legs, the latter of which forces them to use motorized carts for transportation.  However, an exceptionally strong Lokomo named Byrne is capable of walking on his legs.\n\n===Oocca===\nThe {{nihongo|Oocca|\u5929\u7a7a\u4eba|Tenk\u016b-jin|lit. \"sky people\"}}  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in ''Twilight Princess''.

A female Oocca named {{nihongo|Ooccoo|\u304a\u3070\u3061\u3083\u3093|Oba-chan}} can warp the player back to the entrance of the game's dungeons. Ooccoo's son, {{nihongo|Ooccoo Jr|\u307c\u304f\u3061\u3083\u3093|Boku-chan}}, warps the player to Ooccoo's location. In ''Twilight Princess'', these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous cannon.\n\n===Minish===\nMinish, referred to in their native language as {{nihongo|Picori|\u30d4\u30c3\u30b3\u30eb|Pikkoru|inspired by the [[Koropokkuru]]}}, are small humanoid [[Sprite (folklore)|sprites]] no bigger than a human [[thumb]] that live in secret. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in ''The Minish Cap''. Most Minish are helpful, and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, {{nihongo|Vaati|\u30b0\u30d5\u30fc|Guf\u016b}} became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.\n\n===Mogma===\nThe {{nihongo|Mogma|\u30e2\u30b0\u30de\u65cf|Moguma-zoku}} are long-armed anthropomorphic rodents who debuted in ''Skyward Sword.'' They are demolition experts who like digging for treasure and are known to never go anywhere without their bomb bag.  Mogmas are found in Eldin Volcano and play major parts in the plot of the Volcano Summit, Eldin Volcano, the Fire Sanctuary, and the Earth Temple.\n\n===Parella===\nThe {{nihongo|Parella|\u30d1\u30e9\u30b2\u65cf|Parage-zoku}} are an aquatic squid-like race who debuted in ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the underwater spiraling caverns of Lake Floria. Conical spirals appear as their central body and the shape of their dwellings.\n\n===Rito===\nThe {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} are a race of bird-like humanoids who debuted in ''The Wind Waker''. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. No Rito is born with wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings.\n\nRito appear to be covered by dark shaded skin or feathers. Most Rito have red eyes, but the Rito Chieftain has yellow eyes. They have pointed ears,  bird-like feet, and a beak whose shape and size varies from Rito to Rito. Unlike real-life birds, his beak appears to only be used for smelling, and cannot be used as a mouth. However, the Rito have a mouth below this beak.\n\nThroughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. While not in use,  Rito wings are mostly white with black colored plumage along the ends. When in flight the top of a Rito's wings are colored brown with black along the edges while the bottoms of the wings contain white plumage along the wings interior. However Medli has pure white wings, possibly suggesting that female Rito have white wings or that her wings are not fully grown yet. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time, likely due to inexperience.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], the Rito reside in the Tabantha region in northwest Hyrule. The Rito cannot fly at a preferred height because the Divine Beast Vah Medoh shoots down Rito who fly at its height. The Rito warrior Teba helps Link board Vah Medoh, but is severely injured by Medoh's cannons. After Link defeats Windblight Ganon, the Rito Champion Revali regains control of Vah Medoh and prepares to blast Ganon when Link finally fights him. Notably, Revali resents Link, stating that he has many skills as an archer, and that he was only called to assist Link because Link has the Master Sword.\n\n===Sheikah===\nThe {{nihongo|Sheikah|\u30b7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc|Sh\u012bk\u0101}} are an ancient clan of mysterious [[ninja]]-like warriors distinguished by, but not limited to, red eyes, and white hair, who protect the Hylian Royal Family.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Professor Shikashi: \"Have you heard the legend of the \"Shadow Folk\"? They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family.\"</ref> They bear some physical resemblance the to Hylians, but are a completely different species, with much more technological prowess and lifespans that can extend over many millenia as they . As revealed in ''Skyward Sword'', the Sheikah are servants of the goddess Hylia, whose reincarnation is Zelda. The Sheikah crying eye symbol is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. It is alluded that the tear was added after the Hyrule Civil War, which took place some time before the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. By the events of ''Ocarina of Time'', the Sheikah are referred to as an extinct race who built the Shadow Temple, with Impa among the last few members. In ''Skyward Sword'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Majora's Mask'', Sheikah Stones or Gossip Stones created by the Sheikah give Link information on where to go and what to do.\n\nVery few Sheikah members are met throughout the games, with the only recurring one being various incarnations of Zelda's [[nursemaid]] Impa. Others include Impa's descendant Impaz and the [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] Madame Fanadi, both from ''Twilight Princess'', and the Composer Brothers from ''Ocarina of Time'', who researched magical music for the Royal Family before killing themselves when Ganondorf demanded the fruits of their labour. They are met in an undead form, as Poes, in the Kakariko Graveyard.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the ancient Sheikah invented the Divine Beasts and Guardians 10,000 years before the Great Calamity to fight Ganon. The Sheikah reside primarily in Kakariko Village, but can be found elsewhere, such as the two Ancient Tech Labs or in Tarrey Town. An old painter named Pikango left Kakariko Village many years ago to search for beautiful landscapes, and uses his knowledge to help Link locate his memories. Link also possesses a Sheikah Slate, a piece of ancient technology that can be upgraded with various runes. The four primary Runes are Magnesis, which can move metallic objects; Remote Bombs, circular or cube-shaped bombs that can remotely detonate once thrown or dropped; Stasis, which can freeze objects and monsters; and Cryonis, which can create icy blocks on watery surfaces.\n\nAdditionally in ''Breath of the Wild'' is a group of rebellious, antagonistic Sheikah known as the Yiga Clan. 10,000 years ago, after the First Great Calamity, the Sheikah split due to the king of the time exiling them out of fear of their technology. Some remained loyal, and went to live as peaceful farmers in Kakariko Village. Others felt betrayed, and turned against the kingdom, becoming a militant Sheikah group  and siding with Calamity Ganon due to both now having a common enemy. They then adopted an upside-down Sheikah eye as their symbol. Just over 100 years ago, when the Calamity's return was inevitable, the militant Sheikah came out of hiding. Spearheaded by Master Kohga, whose family had lead for at least four generations, they called themselves the Yiga Clan and went on the hunt for the enemies of the Calamity, including Link and Princess Zelda, but were pushed back and forced to make a hideout in an abandoned Gerudo archaeological site. Their hideout is located in Karusa Valley in the Gerudo Highlands. They spawn throughout the world and sometimes appear as lost travelers or merchants who will attack Link if he talks to them. There are three types of Yiga Clansmen: Yiga Footsoldiers, who may ambush Link with a Duplex Bow which can fire two arrows at once, or may disguise as a Hylian, only to reveal themselves and fight with a Vicious Sickle or a Demon Carver; Yiga Blademasters, who carry around a Windcleaver, and Master Kogha, a large master of esoteric arts who waits in the Yiga Clan Hideout while his minions search for Link. He is referenced by certain disguised Yiga. One Kakariko Villager, the guard Dorian, is an ex-Yiga member. After being stationed there, he found a wife who bore two daughters with him, Koko and Cottla, all of whom made him want to change his ways; the Yiga murdered his wife when they discovered his defection.\n\nIt is also here that the Sheikah are shown as a race with diversity, with many members sporting grey, brown or blue eyes and some having varying hair colour. Only one member, Purah, the ancient researcher and older sister of Impa, is shown to have red eyes. Jerrin, wife of elderly researcher Robbie, and her son Grant\u00e9 are the only two members with blonde hair, and Rola, as well as the entire Yiga Clan, exhibit black hair. Rola and as the elderly couple Steen and Trissa have brown skin; the other members have skin ranging from pale to tan.\n\n===Subrosian===\n{{nihongo|Subrosians|\u30a6\u30fc\u30e9|\u016ara}} are a mysterious race that live in the subterranean world of Subrosia in ''Oracle of Seasons''. They have large glowing eyes and are always seen wearing either green, blue or red hooded cloaks. There are two exceptions: Rosa, who wears a yellow cloak with a ribbon, and another unnamed yellow-clothed Subrosian who gives Link a Secret to use in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are shy when around people of other races and prefer to be rarely seen. They can survive in lava and use a currency made of metal rocks found in the ground called Ore Chunks.\n\n===Tokay===\n{{nihongo|Tokay|\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2\u4eba|Tokage-jin|lit. \"lizard people\"}} are green-scaled lizards who reside on Crescent Island in Labrynna in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are known to search for valuable items and be deceitful. They are also expert gardeners which can grow scent seeds from seedlings over a course of four hundred years. They have never seen anyone from other races, so when they see Link, they think he is a Tokay without a tail and call him \"Strange Tokay\".\n\n===Twili===\n{{nihongo|Twili|\u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u6c11|Towairaito no Tami}} are a race that come from the Twilight Realm and first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' They are the descendants of the Dark Interlopers, who were sent to the Twilight Realm by the {{nihongo|Golden Goddesses|\u4e09\u67f1\u306e\u5973\u795e|Mihashira no Megami <small>Three Goddesses</small>}} after trying to seize control of the Sacred Realm. Eventually, they abandoned their plans to rule the Sacred Realm and Hyrule and became peacefully adapted to the Twilight Realm. One member of their race is {{nihongo|[[Midna]]|\u30df\u30c9\u30ca|Midona}}. {{nihongo|Zant|\u30b6\u30f3\u30c8|Zanto}} was also part of this race. He overthrew Midna with Ganon's help and helped Ganon take over Hyrule.\n\nThe skin tone of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, necks, and chest tend to be gray. The Twili have long limbs, necks, and heads, and great variances in appearance.\n\n===Wizzrobes===\n{{nihongo|Wizzrobes|\u30a6\u30a3\u30ba\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Wizur\u014dbu}} are [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] creatures that wear [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] robes and often use fire and ice magic. In ''The Wind Waker,'' they can also summon other enemies and wear [[toucan]]-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda.]]''\n\n''Breath of the Wild'' introduced Electric Wizzrobes, who use Lighting or Thunderstorm Rods. They can teleport and shoot electricity. The other Wizzrobes can also teleport and shoot fire and ice respectively.\n\n===Yeti===\nYetis are creatures that resemble the 'real-life' yeti, but have large beaver-like tails and speak with poor grammar. The females are smaller than the males and wear an armless sweater, showing no arms or tail. {{nihongo|Yeta|\u30de\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3|Mat\u014dnya}} and {{nihongo|Yeto|\u30c9\u30b5\u30f3\u30b3\u30d5|Dosankofu}}, characters who live in Snowpeak Ruins in ''Twilight Princess'' were {{nihongo|[[Yeti]]s|\u96ea\u7537|yukiotoko}}.<ref><!--\"The wife of Yeto. She is a yeti who lives in the Snowpeak Ruins... she became possessed by the mirror and was transformed into the great, icy Blizzeta\"-->[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] (2008) In-game trophy description of the \"Yeta\" trophy.</ref> Yeto helps Link by giving him soup that heals up to eight hearts of his health.\n\n===Zora===\nThe {{nihongo|Zora|\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Z\u014dra}{ZOR-ah}} are a race of aquatic [[piscine humanoid]]s that appear in nearly every game of the series. In the original game and ''Link to the Past'', Zoras were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in ''A Link to the Past'', allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By ''Ocarina of Time'', their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zoras rely heavily on water, and can only live on land for limited time periods.<ref>[[Super Smash Brothers Brawl]] (2008). In game trophy description of the \"Zora\" trophy.</ref> Zoras are mostly seen gracefully swimming about and frolicking in water. Besides routine swimming and sports, Zoras also enjoy music.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040347/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/z.jsp \"Led by their King, the Zoras are peaceful creatures who enjoy music and sports\"]</ref>\n\nMost Zoras do not wear [[clothing]], and they are generally covered in silver [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], which give them a pale blue sheen from a distance. Where humans sometimes have long hair, average Zoras have rear-hanging [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions that resemble tails. These tails undulate periodically, which gives a Zora's head the unique semblance of a fish. They are sometimes depicted as having webbed feet and hands. They lack ears in the traditional sense, but do have pronounced noses and gills on their abdomen. Their fins can be used to fight by extending out to serve as sharp weapons. Zoras lay [[egg]]s to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zoras are [[tadpole]]-like with a circular body and a long, skinny tail ending in a [[wikt:fluke|fluke]].\n\nZora government is apparently [[Monarchy|monarchical]], either ruled by a king, {{nihongo|King Zora|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Kinguz\u014dra}}, or queen, such as Queen {{nihongo|Rutela|\u30eb\u30c6\u30e9|Rutera}} from ''Twilight Princess''. Two different tribes exist: \"river Zora\" are more violent and can shoot fire, while \"sea Zora\" make up the friendly Zoras. The Zora Royal Family is responsible for maintaining order among their people, overseeing care for {{nihongo|Jabu Jabu|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6}}, whom they worship as a guardian god,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', [[King Zora]]: \u201cOur guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear [[Princess Ruto]]!\u201d</ref> and assuring that the waters upon which he and all creatures rely are clean and pure.\n\nThe Zora appear to be extinct in ''The Wind Waker''; a sage named {{nihongo|Laruto|\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8|Raruto}} is encountered in spirit. They may be linked to the {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} race, along with Princess {{nihongo|Ruto|\u30eb\u30c8}}. The Zora typically inhabit fresh water such as Zora River and Lake Hylia, while sea-dwelling Zora are known to appear in Termina (''Majora's Mask'') and Labrynna (''Oracle of Ages'')\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', Link is able to inhabit the body of the Zora Mikau, who was killed by Gerudo pirates, and can use his fins in the same manner as the boomerang.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Zoras are a major part of the game. Link must head to Zora's Domain in Lanayru to meet with King Dorephan and Prince Sidon. The King called for a Hylian because Zora's Domain was in danger of being washed away by Divine Beast Vah Ruta, who was at the East Reservoir Lake. Muzu, a Zora elder and the King's assistant, resents Link, because him and most Zora elders blame Link for the death of the beloved Zora Champion and Princess, Mipha. After realizing that Link has had a special connection with the princess, he tasks Link with finding 20 Shock Arrows from Ploymus Mountain, which is guarded by a Lynel. After retrieving the arrows, Link heads for the East Reservoir Lake to board Vah Ruta. Once he regains control of the beast, Mipha appears as a spirit and grants Link her healing ability. She then moves Vah Ruta to a location that isn't blocked so she can have a direct lock on Hyrule Castle and assist Link in fighting Ganon.\n\n===Creatures===\nNote: Some creatures' outlook may vary in different titles of the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Armos'''|\u30a2\u30e2\u30b9|Amosu}} are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. ''The Minish Cap'' features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Beamos'''|\u30d3\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9|B\u012bmosu}} like Armos are statues built to guard ancient ruins. Beamos sit stationary scanning the room with a single rotating \"eye\". When they spot an intruder they fire off a high powered laser that tracks the target some distance. They first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Biri and Bari'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2|G\u014dria}} are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.\n*'''Blade Traps''': Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Bokoblin'''|\u30dc\u30b3\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Bokoburin}} are demonic goblin-like enemies that wield bladed weapons or clubs. They have red skin and small horns and are very aggressive to intruders. They first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Later, they reappear in ''Skyward Sword'' and ''Breath of the Wild'' as a common enemy. Like Bulblins, they are prone to following particular evil forces, mainly the Demon Lord Ghirahim from ''Skyward Sword''.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Bubbles'''|\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb|Baburu}}, also known as Anti-Fairies or Whisps, are dark fairies that take the form of giant flaming skulls. They can place curses on their victims, the color of their flame denoting the abilities they possess. For example, if a Blue Bubble bites Link he will be temporarily unable to draw his sword. In some games Link can use Magic Powder to turn Bubbles into healing fairies. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Buzz Blobs'''|\u30d0\u30ba\u30d6\u30ed\u30d6|Bazuburobu}} are electrical tapering creatures made of goo. They are passive, but generate large amounts of static electricity when hit. Buzz Blobs deal damage when struck with metal weapons such as swords, with the exception of the Golden Sword, requiring the use of ranged weapons, which can either defeat them instantly or stun them, leaving them vulnerable to sword strikes. They are skinny down near the ground and widen at the top.\n*{{nihongo|'''ChuChus'''|\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|Chuchu}} are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a smiling mouth that have a variety of colors. In ''The Wind Waker'' their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in ''Majora's Mask'', but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' named \"Bit\" and \"Bot\", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In ''Twilight Princess'', after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In ''Skyward Sword'', ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In ''Breath of the Wild'', ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but retain their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-enemies.php#ChuchuBlue |title=Zelda Dungeon Wiki: Enemies: ChuChus |publisher=Zeldadungeon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>\n*{{nihongo|'''Cuccos'''|\u30b3\u30c3\u30b3|Kokko}} are a type of Hylian [[chicken]] commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat. Although Cuccos strongly resemble real-life chickens they differ in several key ways. Most Cuccos can fly short distances and are even strong enough to glide while carrying the weight of an adult man, allowing Link to use them to glide to otherwise unreachable areas. Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. While normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if attacked repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area. Cuccos first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''. They mostly come in white, although ''The Minish Cap'' had gold Cuccos and ''Twilight Princess'' had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well. In ''Ocarina of Time'', there was a single blue Cucco that was used in a trading sequence.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Darknuts'''|\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|T\u0101tonakku}} are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. In ''The Wind Waker'', when their helmets are removed, they are revealed to have jackal-like heads. Some Darknuts also have capes, which must be destroyed before they can be hurt. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''. They reappear in groups at Hyrule Castle. They also appeared in ''Twilight Princess'' for the first time in The Temple of Time, and in several other dungeons thereafter.\n*{{nihongo|'''Deku Babas'''|\u30c7\u30af\u30d0\u30d0|Deku Baba}} are [[Venus fly trap]]-like [[carnivorous plant]]s, that live in forests. They spend much of their time shrunk down springing from the ground whenever their [[root]]s detect the footsteps of potential prey. They first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Dodongos'''|\u30c9\u30c9\u30f3\u30b4|Dodongo}} are fire-breathing reptiles that resemble gigantic iguanas. They move slowly, protected by their thick scales but are incredibly aggressive, eating anything that comes within reach of their mouths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/d.jsp#Dodongos |title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia: Dodongos |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508025421/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/d.jsp#Dodongos |archivedate=2014-05-08 }}</ref> Baby Dodongos are born limbless and spend much of their time buried underground <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp#BabyDodongo |title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia: Baby Dodongo |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831212904/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp#BabyDodongo |archivedate=2005-08-31 }}</ref> and when attacked they explode.

Floormasters roam around the room and are visible at all times, while Wallmasters hide on the ceiling out of sight. Also, Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked, whereas Wallmasters do not. Wallmasters first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda'' while Floormasters first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''. Floormasters appeared in ''The Wind Waker'' as a spectral arm and hand that will transport Link to a jail-like holding area if he is caught. They do not split up when attacked.\n*'''Gargoyles''' are statues that appear in ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''.  They shoot fireballs at Link in the underground dungeons.\n*{{nihongo|'''Gibdos'''|\u30ae\u30d6\u30c9|Gibudo}} are undead creatures wrapped like [[mummy|mummies]]. They resemble ReDeads in regards to their slow and zombie-like movement; in some games, setting a Gibdo's bandages alight will reveal a Stalfos or a ReDead underneath. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can use the Gibdo Mask to communicate with them. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Iron Knuckles'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|Aian-nakku}} are heavily armored knights with axes. While they are even slower than the Darknuts, they are the most powerful enemies in their games as they can take four hearts from Link with just one hit and because of that they are often used to guard treasures. They first appeared in ''The Adventure of Link''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Keese'''|\u30ad\u30fc\u30b9|K\u012bsu}} are [[bat]]-like creatures that often lurk in dark places such as caves and dungeons, where they dive bomb unwary travelers attempting to bite off chunks of flesh. Some Keese have the ability to pick up elements they fly through and there are fire, ice, cursed, and electric variants. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Leevers'''|\u30ea\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|R\u012bb\u0101}} are conical [[cactus]]-like monsters that primarily live in sandy areas, such as deserts and beaches. They hide beneath the sand, burrowing to the top to attack in ambush when they sense the footsteps of an intruder. Leevers attack by spinning rapidly and slamming their thorny bodies into their target. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Like Likes'''|\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30af|Raikuraiku}} are yellowish cylindrical monsters that can suck in creatures as large as humans and consume items they carry. They are known for swallowing the shields and tunics that Link uses. Like Likes dissolve into a puddle when killed, leaving the stolen items.

This creature has multiple different variations, consisting of red, blue, white, and silver. The white and silver Lynel only appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. In that game, red and blue Lynel can be found in many places. The white one appears in a lot of places too, but mostly in colder climates. They can be found naturally in Gerudo Highlands and N. Tabantha Snowfield. Every Lynel, except for the one in Shatterback Point northeast of Zora's Domain, will become Silver after being beaten enough.

They are sometimes accompanied by Pig Warriors, monsters with the same basic form but more porcine characteristics. Both types commonly wield spears, swords, bows, or occasionally massive clubs. They are one of the most common enemies within the games they appear, and are considered \"mighty\", but also \"dumb\".<ref>''The Wind Waker'', Moblin Figurine: \"These mighty enemies swing their long spears with the greatest of ease.\"</ref><ref>''The Minish Cap, Swiftblade: \"Those pig-faced Moblins...You see them around the Minish Woods, right?

In ''Spirit Tracks'', Miniblins were pirates usually led by a \"Big Blin\", a larger, muscled variation that wields a spiked club. In ''Skyward Sword'', they are depicted as fatter and will use their weight in a final attempt to crush Link before dying. In ''Breath of the Wild'', they are taller and lankier and revealed that they are carnivorous and require a diet of meat and fish to maintain their bulky frames. \n**'''Stalmoblin''' are the animated skeletons of Moblins that appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. Like Stalkoblin, their skeletons continue to reanimate as long as a Stalmoblin skull is present.

Octoroks produce rocks within their body that they can fire from their snout via compressed air with the force of a [[musket]] shot. Some species of Octorok are land-dwelling while others are mostly aquatic. '''Big Octos''' are a very large ocean-dwelling breed sometimes known to attack ships.

They are most commonly found in dark places, such as forests, caves, and dungeons but can also sometimes be found in towns at night. Skulltulas and Giant Skulltulas hang from ceiling surfaces, suspended by a strand of silk waiting to drop on unwary prey. Smaller Skulltulas called Skullwalltulas are commonly encountered on climbable surfaces and will attempt to bite Link if he doesn't first shoot them down. Rare Golden Skulltulas are associated with the \"Curse of Skulltula\" and must killed to break the curse.\n*{{nihongo|'''Stalchild'''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc|Sutarubeb\u012b}} are smaller forms of the Stalfos.

Unlike Stalfos, they do not carry any weapons, and instead swipe at their target with long, bloody claws. In ''Ocarina of Time'' there is an easter egg where after a certain number is defeated, a larger one appears. They make their debut in ''Ocarina of Time''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Stalfos'''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30b9|Sutarufosu}} are animated skeletons mostly from the remains of dead warriors who still have a strong will to fight, and serve evil powers such as [[Ganon]] or [[Vaati]]. In ''Ocarina of Time'', by using the Mask of Truth, the player learns from a Gossip Stone that humans that get lost while in the Lost Woods will become Stalfos.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia |publisher=Dark Horse Books |author=Gombos, Michael |year=2013 |isbn=9781616550417 |edition=First English |location=Milwaukie, OR |page=84 |oclc=808413518}}</ref> They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tektites'''|\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8|Tekutaito}} are cyclopean four-legged [[insect]]oid creatures who use their powerful legs to leap upon and attack prey.

Found on the Surface are several locations visited in games that take place after the events of ''Skyward Sword'': \"Faron Woods\" (shown in ''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''), \"Lake Floria\" (''Breath of the Wild''), \"Eldin\" (''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''), \"Eldin Volcano\" (implied to be Death Mountain), and the arid \"Lanayru Desert\", which is seen as a fecund region in ''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild''. The \"Lanayru Mining Facility\" has blue Time-Shift Stones that the Hyrule Historia ties to the titular blue ocarina from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''.\n\n===Master Sword===\n[[File:Master Sword.png|thumb|210px|Artwork of the Master Sword in its pedestal from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'']]\nThe {{nihongo|Master Sword|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9|Masut\u0101 S\u014ddo}}, also known as \"The Blade of Evil's Bane\", the \"Sword of Resurrection\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Aonuma ventures out into the wild to find the Master Sword of Resurrection|url= https://nintendowire.com/news/2017/02/03/aonuma-ventures-wild-find-master-sword-resurrection/ |publisher=NintendoWire |accessdate=12 July 2017|date= 2017-02-03 }}</ref> and the \"sword that seals the darkness\" is a [[magic sword]] that often acts as the ultimate weapon for [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as the chosen hero. It is one of the few weapons capable of harming [[Ganon]] and a key to the Sacred Realm. First introduced in ''[[A Link To The Past]]'', it has the power to \"repel evil\", which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and evil beings and keep them from using the sword. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', the blade originally began as the Goddess Sword, which has a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Eventually, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbs Demise's remains.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/16/e3-2010-nintendo-developer-roundtable-live-blog E3 2010: Nintendo Developer Roundtable Live Blog]. [[IGN]], June 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe sword traditionally rests in [[wiktionary:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] locations indigenous to [[#Hyrule|Hyrule]], such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to [[Arthurian legend]], the Master Sword is often obtained by [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|pulling it from a stone pedestal]]. The sword is often not at full power, leading it to need to be \"recharged\" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in ''[[A Link to the Past]]'', it was tempered to the Tempered Sword. It can later be upgraded to the Golden Sword. Similarly, in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce.<ref>[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], King of Red Lions: The fact that the Master Sword lost the power to repel evil suggests to me that something has happened to the sages who infused the blade with the gods\u2019 power. The sages should be in Hyrule...  in the Wind Temple to the north and the Earth Temple to the south, praying to the gods.</ref> In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'' the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged becoming temporarily unusable. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods. Zelda moved it there to be guarded by the Great Deku Tree and to protect knowledge of its location from Calamity Ganon. Link can travel to the Korok Forest at any point after receiving the Paraglider, though he can only remove the sword after obtaining 13 or more Heart Containers, as removing it drains Link's hearts as a way to test his strength. In addition to its unbreakability, Link can also fire Sword Beams while he is at full health. The Master Sword has a base damage of 30 but its true power glows when in the presence of pools of Calamity Ganon's Malice, Cursed Enemies, and all of Calamity Ganon's various forms; its durability is greatly increased in this state. It can later be enhanced to 60 damage once completing the \"trial of the sword\" side quest.\n\nOnce removed, Link sees a vision of Zelda entrusting the Master Sword to the protection of the Great Deku Tree 100 years ago. During her conversation with him, Princess Zelda reveals that the sword spoke to her (which is implied to be Fi, whose consciousness apparently still exists within the sword though unable to manifest her spirit form) and told her that her destiny was not finished and that she still had something she must do, leading to Princess Zelda's sealing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle for 100 years while Link slept. The weapon's in-game description reveals that the sword is delighted to be in Link's possession, echoing Fi's words at the end of ''Skyward Sword''. 100 years after Calamity Ganon was sealed in Hyrule Castle, the sword became known across Hyrule as the Sword that Seals the Darkness and is sought by several travelers Link encounters despite the fact that only the chosen hero can wield its power.\n\nThe Master Sword is a [[Arming sword|double-edged one-handed sword]]. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]. On the flats of the blade near the [[hilt]] is a [[Triforce]] symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a blue or purple curved [[Guard (weapon)|crossguard]] in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. Since ''The Wind Waker'', the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the [[Wise old man|sages]] in the mid-game. In ''Breath of the Wild'', this glow represents the Master Sword's true power. ''Breath of the Wild'' is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state.\n\n[[Nintendo Power]] listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming: citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=44 |title-link=Nintendo Power }}</ref>\n\n===Triforce===\n{{main|Triforce}}\n[[File:Triforce.svg|thumb|210px|The Triforce is represented as three conjoined golden triangles, with one triangle placed above the other two.]]\nThe {{nihongo|Triforce|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Toraif\u014dsu}}, also called {{nihongo|\"Power of the Gods\"|\u795e\u306e\u529b|Kami no Chikara}} and the {{nihongo|\"Golden Triangle\"|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u5927\u4e09\u89d2|\u014cgon no Dai-Sankaku}}, is a triangular sacred [[relic]] left behind by the three [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Golden Goddesses]] when they created Hyrule. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Power]]|\u529b\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chikara no Toraif\u014dsu}}, the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Wisdom]]|\u77e5\u6075\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chie no Toraif\u014dsu}}, and the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Courage]]|\u52c7\u6c17\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Y\u016bki no Toraif\u014dsu}}. These embody the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|their respective goddesses]], and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers as a result.\n\nWhen united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic they value most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters \"chosen by destiny\". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.\n\nThe Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with [[Ganon]], who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with [[Princess Zelda]], whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.\n\n==Other worlds==\n===Termina===\n{{nihongo|Termina|\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30ca|Tarumina}} is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''. Link falls into this world from a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule, and many of its citizens have identical names and appearances to (although different personalities from) people in Hyrule. The land itself is split into four distinct regions, one for every compass direction, and each guarded by four giant deities: The [[swamp]]y Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; The icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east. Its capital, Clock Town, lies in the center.\n\n===Lorule===\n{{nihongo|Lorule|\u30ed\u30a6\u30e9\u30eb|Rouraru}} is a parallel world to Hyrule in ''A Link Between Worlds''. It is similar to Hyrule in geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda's Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce and was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link, and Hilda's former servant Ravio manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from ''Twilight Princess'', ''The Phantom Hourglass'', and ''A Link to the Past'', respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. In ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'', Link travels to Labrynna and Holodrum. ''Triforce Heroes'' is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite web |quote= Hyrule and Hytopia are connected. |author=Tri Force Heroes developers |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/NintendoHandheldGaming/photos/a.150955828309750.40686.149152295156770/953796588025666/?type=3 |title=Most games in The Legend of Zelda series have a connection to Hyrule. Does the land of Hytopia connect to Hyrule in any way? |website=Facebook}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Races==\n===Ancient Robots===\nThe {{nihongo|Ancient Robots|RS-301}} are a mechanical race from ''Skyward Sword''. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone they can be revived and serve three purposes. Some of them mine for Timeshift Stones, one group protected one of the Sacred Flames, and some act as Lanayru's servants. In addition there is a band of Ancient Robot Pirates, though only two of them are seen: LD-002S Scervo on the Sandship, and LD-003D Dreadfuse in the Sky Keep. During Link's quest for Nayru's Flame, Link is aided by a robot named Skipper, who is captain of the Sandship and lost his ship to the Pirate Scervo. Skipper aids Link in traversing the Lanayru Sand Sea using his Timeshift Stone powered motorboat, which can transform the impassible sea of sand into the ancient sea of water that once existed in the past. Also, Gondo, one of the citizens of Skyloft, owns an Ancient Robot that he inherited from his grandfather; at one point in the game this robot, named Scrapper, is restored to full functionality, and assists Link by carrying items up to Skyloft from the surface. The Ancient Robots require the oil produced by Ancient Flowers to function; because these flowers can no longer be found in the present day Lanayru Desert, it is implied that the flower's disappearance resulted in the decline of the LD-301 Series Ancient Robots. Most ancient robots are part of the LD-301 Series, including LD-301S Scrapper and LD-301N Skipper, while Servo and Dreadfuse are part of the LD-002 and LD-003 series, which unlike the LD-301 Series remain functional in the present.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', similar robots exist called Guardians and Divine Beasts. The Divine Beasts consist of Vah Ruta of the Zora, Vah Rudania of the Gorons, Vah Naboris of the Gerudo, and Vah Medoh of the Rito. The Guardians are ancient mechanisms with powerful sniper blasts who were intended to be used to defeat Ganon, but Ganon used his power to turn the robots against Hyrule. Mipha, the Zora Champion, Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion, Daruk, the Goron Champion, and Revali, the Rito Champion, who once piloted the Divine Beasts, were killed by the Blight Ganons, creations of Ganon who represent the element of the Divine Beast e.g. Thunderblight Ganon for Vah Naboris.\n\n===Anouki===\n{{nihongo|Anouki|\u30e6\u30ad\u30ef\u30ed\u30b7|Yukiwaroshi}} are an Inuit-like race that appear to be a cross between a reindeer and penguins. There are different variations of them with purple, red, blue, and yellow shirts and facial hair or small or big antlers. They are found on the Isle of Frost in the World of Ocean King and in Anouki Village in New Hyrule. In ''Spirit Tracks'', the Anouki are the only race who live in the snow realm.\n\n===Bokoblin===\nBokoblins are a race of humanoid [[goblin]]-like creatures, that first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and wield Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In ''Twilight Princess'', they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In ''Skyward Sword'', Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield ancient technology; and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. The game introduces the bow-wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of weapons, but tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows, the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continuously regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed, because a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins, which are stronger and more resilient. Cursed Bokoblins return in ''Breath of the Wild,'' but are depicted as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice.\n\nRed Bokoblins and Stalkoblins drop Bokoblin Horns and Bokoblin Fangs, while Blue, Black, and Silver Bokoblins drop those parts along with Bokoblin Guts. These monster parts can be sold to shops and merchants for Rupees or to Kilton for ''Mon'' at the Fang and Bone shop, though Link can also cook them with bugs to make Elixirs or use them as materials by the four Great Fairies to upgrade his armor. Link can also buy a Bokoblin Mask from Kilton, which allows him to disguise himself as a Bokoblin and blend in with them.\n\n===Bulblin===\n{{nihongo|Bulblins|\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Buruburin}} are a green, horned race that resemble the [[orc]]s of classic fantasy. They are led by {{nihongo|King Bulblin|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Kingu Buruburin}},<ref name=\"BulblinTrophy\"><!--\"Creatures that serve under King Bulblin.

They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' King Bulblin appears as an obstacle in the Bridge of Eldin stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.\n\n===Cobble===\nThe Cobble are a race that appear in ''Phantom Hourglass''. The Cobble once inhabited a prosperous land called the Cobble Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only Cobble that remain are the ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress in ancient Egyptian-like clothes and live in pyramid-like temples. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is all that remains of the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the Cobble by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt Cobble war machine that is disrupting the king's eternal rest.\n\n===Deku===\nThe {{nihongo|Deku|\u30c7\u30af\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4|Dekunattsu}} are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' that appear mostly in the [[overworld]] and dungeons. Deku are small creatures with leaves sprouting out from their heads. They often have red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. Their bodies consist of wood and leaves and perish quickly if set on fire. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs. Deku Scrubs are the most common type, which have green leaves and often give information when caught. Mad Scrubs are violent, have red and yellow leaves, and do not talk. Business Scrubs are traders who offer to sell their wares and services. Royal Scrubs have larger heads, bigger eyes, smaller mouths, and extra leaves covering their body. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of an unknown deceased Deku Scrub who is  implied to be the son of the Deku King's butler. In this form, Link can temporarily fly using a Deku Flower, shoot bubbles, and hop on deep water five times before sinking.\n\n===Dragon===\n[[Dragon]]s are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia's ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he could not locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In ''The Wind Waker'', the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the protector and patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo, and defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In ''Skyward Sword'', Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. During his quest for Farore's Flame, Link aids Faron, who had been injured while fighting Ghirahim; she leads him to the Ancient Cistern. During his quest for the Song of the Hero, Link encounters Eldin after he is captured and imprisoned by Bokoblins during an eruption. Link learns that the Fire Dragon had caused the eruption, and the dragon apologizes to Link for all the trouble it caused him. Unlike the other two dragons, Lanayru is shown to have died from an illness in the past, forcing Link to go back in time, cure him of his illness, and prevent his death. After Link cures him and learning his part of the song, Lanayru allows Link to take part in the Lightning Round, which allows him to face a boss battle challenge and a Silent Realm challenge for various prizes. If Link completes eight boss battles, Lanayru will reward him with the unbreakable Hylian Shield, the strongest shield in the game.\n\n===Fairy===\n{{nihongo|[[Fairy|Fairies]]|\u5996\u7cbe|[[Y\u014dsei]]}} are magical creatures associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that appear as small, winged [[humanoid]]s often obscured by light. Fairies tend to shy away from human settlements and are most often associated with the Lost Woods, but can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule. Fairy Fountains or Fairy Springs are special places that contain sparkling magical water and attract Fairies in large numbers. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one and he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him instead of receiving a [[Game Over]].\n\n{{nihongo|Great Fairies|\u5927\u5996\u7cbe|Dai-y\u014dsei}} are powerful, high ranking fairies that often watch over their smaller brethren. They use their magic to enchant Link's items into more powerful versions and in some games they can also teach Link various magic spells. In ''Ocarina of Time'', the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their Guardian Fairies, who act as constant companions and mentors. One of these is [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]], who serves as Link's sidekick and aids Link in learning about the world outside Kokiri Forest. Another Guardian Fairy is Tatl from ''Majora's Mask'' who was a friend of the Skull Kid until he betrayed her and her brother Tael. In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as ''The Minish Cap'', players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], fairies can be found around the springs of the four great fairies. There is a fifth fairy named Malayna, but she is not a Great Fairy; instead, she is known as the Horse God and can revive dead horses. Fairies can be used to cook potions and other food; if they are used in making a dish, they increase the amount of hearts the food heals before disappearing from the player's inventory.\n\n===Gerudo===\nThe {{nihongo|Gerudo|\u30b2\u30eb\u30c9}} are a tribe of humanoid [[Theft|thieves]] who mainly live in the desert. Physical Gerudo traits typically include bronzed skin, scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold eyes and round ears; however, evil Gerudo like Ganondorf and the Twinrova Sisters possess an olive skin color. Gerudo sentries carry [[pole weapon|polearms]] reminiscent of the Japanese ''[[naginata]]''. Apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century and is crowned king of the tribe, the race consists entirely of women.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Nabooru: \"A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years\u2026 Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!\"</ref> [[Ganon]]dorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo in ''Ocarina of Time'' and the surrogate son of the twin Gerudo witch sisters Kotake and Koume. Gerudo appear as pirates in ''Majora's Mask'', where they live in the ocean at Great Bay, and are ruled by a woman instead of a man.  These Gerudo are enemies of the Zoras. They search for treasures in the sea and assault Zora and fishermen but do not approach Clock Town. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', only women are permitted in the town, so [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] has to [[crossdress]] as a female in order to enter the town. After gaining entrance to Gerudo Town, Link has to retrieve a thunder-resistant helmet known as the Thunder Helm from a clan of thieves called the Yiga, a traitorous formation who broke away from the Sheikah tribe. The helm is used to board Vah Naboris, named after the Sage of Spirit, Nabooru, as stated by the spirit of former Gerudo Champion Urbosa.\n\n===Goron===\n[[File:Goron.JPG|thumb|A Goron, as seen in ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'']]\nThe {{nihongo|Goron|\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3}} are a race of mountain-dwelling [[giant]]s who first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as \"Brother\" or \"Big Brother\". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as [[sumo wrestling]]<ref><!--\"They like sumo wrestling\"-->In-game trophy description of a \"Goron\" from [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008).</ref> and [[racing]]. While not all ''Zelda'' games featuring Gorons include full tribes, the games that do depict as tribes depict them as headed by a [[patriarch]] who is aided by one or more elders who assume leadership of the tribe in the event that the patriarch cannot. {{nihongo|Darunia|\u30c0\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2}} is the patriarch in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Goron elders in ''Twilight Princess'' are {{nihongo|Gor Coron|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Don Kor\u014dne}}, {{nihongo|Gor Amoto|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Don S\u012bgeru}} {{nihongo|Gor Ebizo|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30d3\u30fc\u30be|Don Eb\u012bzo}}, and {{nihongo|Gor Liggs|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30b2\u30fc\u30cc|Don Reg\u0113nu}}.\n\nOne of the oldest races in Hyrule, Gorons' bodies are resistant to intense heat and lava and they consume rocks and minerals,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', Goron figurine: \"These rock- and iron-eaters once lived on Mount Crenel in Western Hyrule.\"</ref><ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \"You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all of your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and strong!\"</ref> which they mine from the earth. By adulthood, most Gorons gain rock-like protrusions on their backs and sometimes on their arms and head as well. These stony growths act as a natural armor and continue to grow as the Goron ages. Gorons enter the [[fetal position]] when resting, and can also assume this position for self defense or to travel at high speed by [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|rolling]]. Gorons endowed with magic power can sprout metal spikes from their body while rolling.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani's memorial: \"If Gorons who possess magic power roll swiftly enough, spikes will emerge from their bodies so that they may mow down enemies.\"</ref>\n\nFor leisure, Gorons enjoy music and dance, rolling and racing,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \u201cThis wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!\u201d [\u2026] \u201cLet me express my joy with more wild rolling!\u201d</ref> games,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages'', Goron: \"We Gorons love games!\"</ref> sumo wrestling, and bathing in hot springs. Gorons have taken on occupations such as crafting, blacksmithing, sculpting, demolition, and merchantry. Rock sirloin, [[amber]], and metal shields are some Goron delicacies.\n\nThree Gorons appear in ''Skyward Sword:'' Gorko, Golo, and Gortram. Gorko and his assistant Golo, are shown working as archaeologists; Gorko travels the land researching ancient artifacts and ruins, while Golo excavates the Lanayru Caves. Unlike the other two, Gortram works as the proprietor of the Rickety Coaster mine cart ride at the abandoned Lanayru Shipyards. All three Gorons are encountered in the Lanayru Desert region at some point and the Lanayru Caves seems to serve as the base of operations for Gorko and Golo.\n\nGorons are large humanoids with long muscular arms, stout legs, hulking shoulders and necks, and rotund bellies. Their skin is generally beige in color and their hair is typically white. Gorons lack external hearing organs; Goron ears are instead holes on the sides of their heads. Most are as tall as a human, though some individuals such as {{nihongo|Biggoron|\u30c0\u30a4\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3|Daigoron}} can grow as large as a mountain. To date, no female Gorons have been seen in the series, but they do exist, as child and baby Gorons do appear and Darunia has a son during the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. Due to their great density, Gorons sink to the bottom of bodies of water and are thus helpless in such an environment. However, they do not need to breath to survive, as a Goron child proves by resting underwater and mentioning that he never feels the need to take a breath. Also, in ''Twilight Princess'', a Goron becomes submerged in the main pool in Zora's Domain, but enjoys the cold water rather than drowning.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani III's memorial: \"Water is disastrous for Goron heroes, for they sink like stones and are rendered motionless in the deep. Beware.\"</ref> Gorons are exceptionally resistant to heat and can walk through shallow [[lava]].\n\nIn ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of the deceased Goron hero Darmani and roll and punch as hard as the Megaton Hammer from ''Ocarina of Time.''\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the Gorons are encountered all over Hyrule, but mostly appear in the Eldin region. They live around Death Mountain, which Link must use heat-resistant armor or elixirs to enter.\n\n===Hylian===<!-- In the official game they call them \"Hylians\". They also call them this on Zelda Universe. (Nintendo's official website) -->\n{{Redirect|Hylian|the language|#Hylian language}}\n{{nihongo|Hylians|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u65cf|Hairia-zoku}} are an [[elf]]-like race that make up the main population of Hyrule, which they established organized civilization on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |title=Zelda Universe |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075201/http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |archive-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|the goddesses]] that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. Link and Princess Zelda belong to this race in all games of the series. In some games, such as ''Twilight Princess'', Hylians are referred to as \"humans\". In ''Skyward Sword'', Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings.\n\n===Keaton===\n{{nihongo|Keaton|\u30ad\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3|K\u012btan}} are a three-tailed fox-like race mostly found in Termina. They normally stay hidden from sight, but reveal themselves to Link and challenge him with a quiz if he wears a Keaton Mask. No known Keaton exist in Hyrule in ''Ocarina of Time'', although at least one of them is a well-known fictional character in Hyrule Castle Town.<ref name=\"Keaton-1\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'': \"Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!\"</ref><ref name=\"Keaton-2\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Death Mountain Guard: \"Oh? Is that a \"Kee...something...\" character mask? I heard he's very popular recently? He's my boy's favorite.\"</ref> In ''The Minish Cap'', however, some thuggish Keaton roam the Hyrule countryside, walking on their hindpaws and having only one tail instead of three; if they injure Link, he loses some Rupees.\n\n===Kikwi===\nThe {{nihongo|Kikwi|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a4\u65cf|Kyui-zoku}} are a race in ''Skyward Sword'' who inhabit the Faron Woods. They have the appearance of black-and-white masked wingless birds, and can cause a plant to blossom from their backs for camouflage.\n\n===Kokiri and Koroks===\nThe {{nihongo|Kokiri|\u30b3\u30ad\u30ea\u65cf|Kokiri-zoku}} are a [[pixie]]-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They were created by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. They do not age once they grow up into kids. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe that they will die if they leave the forest.<ref>'': Ocarina of Time'', Kokiri boy: \"The Great Deku Tree said that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!\"</ref> This belief seems to be false, as Saria leaves the forest when she becomes the Forest Sage. It is also suggested that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid, although this has not been proven definitively.\n\nA Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in ''The Wind Waker'', but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in ''Ocarina of Time'', but he is actually a Hylian whose mother entrusted the Great Deku Tree with his care when he was an infant. It wasn't until he traveled into the future when getting the Master Sword that Link found out he wasn't a Kokiri by aging.\n\nThe {{nihongo|Koroks|\u30b3\u30ed\u30b0|Korogu}} of ''The Wind Waker'' are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood.<ref name=\"Kokiri forms\">''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', Great Deku Tree: \"Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes.\"</ref> They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the \"Forest Haven\", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. The player must solve puzzles to get Korok Seeds from them. Once the player retrieves Korok Seeds from Koroks, one can trade it with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for swords, shields, and bows.\n\n===Light Spirits===\nThere are four {{nihongo|Light Spirits|\u5149\u306e\u7cbe\u970a|Hikari no Seirei}} throughout Hyrule in ''Twilight Princess''.\n\nThe first light spirit is {{Nihongo|Ordona|\u30e9\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30cc|Rato\u0101nu}}, who resembles an Ordon Goat. Ordona has an orb between her antlers and first appears at Ordon Spring when Link has defeated the first Shadow Beast.\n\nThe second light spirit, {{nihongo|Faron|\u30d5\u30a3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Fir\u014dne}}, resembles a monkey. He holds his golden orb with his tail over his head. He appears in Faron Spring when Link has completed the first collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe third light spirit, {{nihongo|Eldin|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Orudin}}, resembles an eagle with his orb between his feet. He appears in the lake near the shaman's house in Kakariko Village once Link has completed the second collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe fourth and last light spirit, {{nihongo|Lanayru|\u30e9\u30cd\u30fc\u30eb|Ran\u0113ru}}, resembles a serpent with his orb inside his mouth. He appears in the cave at Lake Hylia when Link has completed the third and final collection of twilight bugs. But after Lanayru tells Link the story of the three goddesses and the three Fused Shadows, Zant appears and embeds the Shadow Crystal in Link's skull that later allows him to transform between his human and wolf form. He also exposes Midna to Lanayru's light causing her to become very ill and sends Link on the quest for the Master Sword.\n\n===Lokomo===\n{{nihongo|Lokomos|\u30ed\u30b3\u30e2|Rokomo}} are a humanoid race who first appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]''. All but one of the encountered Lokomo are sages who reside in the New Hyrule and the Tower of Spirits. They are distinguishable by their pointed ears and short legs, the latter of which forces them to use motorized carts for transportation.  However, an exceptionally strong Lokomo named Byrne is capable of walking on his legs.\n\n===Oocca===\nThe {{nihongo|Oocca|\u5929\u7a7a\u4eba|Tenk\u016b-jin|lit. \"sky people\"}}  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in ''Twilight Princess''. They live in the {{nihongo|\"City in the Sky\"|\u5929\u7a7a\u90fd\u5e02|Tenk\u016b Toshi}},<ref>\"One of the Oocca, Ooccoo travels around with her son in search of a means to return to her home, the City in the Sky.\" [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Ooccoo & Son in-game trophy description.</ref> an airborne city that acts as the seventh [[dungeon]] in ''Twilight Princess''. A female Oocca named {{nihongo|Ooccoo|\u304a\u3070\u3061\u3083\u3093|Oba-chan}} can warp the player back to the entrance of the game's dungeons. Ooccoo's son, {{nihongo|Ooccoo Jr|\u307c\u304f\u3061\u3083\u3093|Boku-chan}}, warps the player to Ooccoo's location. In ''Twilight Princess'', these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous cannon.\n\n===Minish===\nMinish, referred to in their native language as {{nihongo|Picori|\u30d4\u30c3\u30b3\u30eb|Pikkoru|inspired by the [[Koropokkuru]]}}, are small humanoid [[Sprite (folklore)|sprites]] no bigger than a human [[thumb]] that live in secret. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in ''The Minish Cap''. Most Minish are helpful, and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, {{nihongo|Vaati|\u30b0\u30d5\u30fc|Guf\u016b}} became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.\n\n===Mogma===\nThe {{nihongo|Mogma|\u30e2\u30b0\u30de\u65cf|Moguma-zoku}} are long-armed anthropomorphic rodents who debuted in ''Skyward Sword.'' They are demolition experts who like digging for treasure and are known to never go anywhere without their bomb bag.  Mogmas are found in Eldin Volcano and play major parts in the plot of the Volcano Summit, Eldin Volcano, the Fire Sanctuary, and the Earth Temple.\n\n===Parella===\nThe {{nihongo|Parella|\u30d1\u30e9\u30b2\u65cf|Parage-zoku}} are an aquatic squid-like race who debuted in ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the underwater spiraling caverns of Lake Floria. Conical spirals appear as their central body and the shape of their dwellings.\n\n===Rito===\nThe {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} are a race of bird-like humanoids who debuted in ''The Wind Waker''. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. No Rito is born with wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings.\n\nRito appear to be covered by dark shaded skin or feathers. Most Rito have red eyes, but the Rito Chieftain has yellow eyes. They have pointed ears,  bird-like feet, and a beak whose shape and size varies from Rito to Rito. Unlike real-life birds, his beak appears to only be used for smelling, and cannot be used as a mouth. However, the Rito have a mouth below this beak.\n\nThroughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. While not in use,  Rito wings are mostly white with black colored plumage along the ends. When in flight the top of a Rito's wings are colored brown with black along the edges while the bottoms of the wings contain white plumage along the wings interior. However Medli has pure white wings, possibly suggesting that female Rito have white wings or that her wings are not fully grown yet. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time, likely due to inexperience.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], the Rito reside in the Tabantha region in northwest Hyrule. The Rito cannot fly at a preferred height because the Divine Beast Vah Medoh shoots down Rito who fly at its height. The Rito warrior Teba helps Link board Vah Medoh, but is severely injured by Medoh's cannons. After Link defeats Windblight Ganon, the Rito Champion Revali regains control of Vah Medoh and prepares to blast Ganon when Link finally fights him. Notably, Revali resents Link, stating that he has many skills as an archer, and that he was only called to assist Link because Link has the Master Sword.\n\n===Sheikah===\nThe {{nihongo|Sheikah|\u30b7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc|Sh\u012bk\u0101}} are an ancient clan of mysterious [[ninja]]-like warriors distinguished by, but not limited to, red eyes, and white hair, who protect the Hylian Royal Family.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Professor Shikashi: \"Have you heard the legend of the \"Shadow Folk\"? They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family.\"</ref> They bear some physical resemblance the to Hylians, but are a completely different species, with much more technological prowess and lifespans that can extend over many millenia as they . As revealed in ''Skyward Sword'', the Sheikah are servants of the goddess Hylia, whose reincarnation is Zelda. The Sheikah crying eye symbol is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. It is alluded that the tear was added after the Hyrule Civil War, which took place some time before the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. By the events of ''Ocarina of Time'', the Sheikah are referred to as an extinct race who built the Shadow Temple, with Impa among the last few members. In ''Skyward Sword'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Majora's Mask'', Sheikah Stones or Gossip Stones created by the Sheikah give Link information on where to go and what to do.\n\nVery few Sheikah members are met throughout the games, with the only recurring one being various incarnations of Zelda's [[nursemaid]] Impa. Others include Impa's descendant Impaz and the [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] Madame Fanadi, both from ''Twilight Princess'', and the Composer Brothers from ''Ocarina of Time'', who researched magical music for the Royal Family before killing themselves when Ganondorf demanded the fruits of their labour. They are met in an undead form, as Poes, in the Kakariko Graveyard.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the ancient Sheikah invented the Divine Beasts and Guardians 10,000 years before the Great Calamity to fight Ganon. The Sheikah reside primarily in Kakariko Village, but can be found elsewhere, such as the two Ancient Tech Labs or in Tarrey Town. An old painter named Pikango left Kakariko Village many years ago to search for beautiful landscapes, and uses his knowledge to help Link locate his memories. Link also possesses a Sheikah Slate, a piece of ancient technology that can be upgraded with various runes. The four primary Runes are Magnesis, which can move metallic objects; Remote Bombs, circular or cube-shaped bombs that can remotely detonate once thrown or dropped; Stasis, which can freeze objects and monsters; and Cryonis, which can create icy blocks on watery surfaces.\n\nAdditionally in ''Breath of the Wild'' is a group of rebellious, antagonistic Sheikah known as the Yiga Clan. 10,000 years ago, after the First Great Calamity, the Sheikah split due to the king of the time exiling them out of fear of their technology. Some remained loyal, and went to live as peaceful farmers in Kakariko Village. Others felt betrayed, and turned against the kingdom, becoming a militant Sheikah group  and siding with Calamity Ganon due to both now having a common enemy. They then adopted an upside-down Sheikah eye as their symbol. Just over 100 years ago, when the Calamity's return was inevitable, the militant Sheikah came out of hiding. Spearheaded by Master Kohga, whose family had lead for at least four generations, they called themselves the Yiga Clan and went on the hunt for the enemies of the Calamity, including Link and Princess Zelda, but were pushed back and forced to make a hideout in an abandoned Gerudo archaeological site. Their hideout is located in Karusa Valley in the Gerudo Highlands. They spawn throughout the world and sometimes appear as lost travelers or merchants who will attack Link if he talks to them. There are three types of Yiga Clansmen: Yiga Footsoldiers, who may ambush Link with a Duplex Bow which can fire two arrows at once, or may disguise as a Hylian, only to reveal themselves and fight with a Vicious Sickle or a Demon Carver; Yiga Blademasters, who carry around a Windcleaver, and Master Kogha, a large master of esoteric arts who waits in the Yiga Clan Hideout while his minions search for Link. He is referenced by certain disguised Yiga. One Kakariko Villager, the guard Dorian, is an ex-Yiga member. After being stationed there, he found a wife who bore two daughters with him, Koko and Cottla, all of whom made him want to change his ways; the Yiga murdered his wife when they discovered his defection.\n\nIt is also here that the Sheikah are shown as a race with diversity, with many members sporting grey, brown or blue eyes and some having varying hair colour. Only one member, Purah, the ancient researcher and older sister of Impa, is shown to have red eyes. Jerrin, wife of elderly researcher Robbie, and her son Grant\u00e9 are the only two members with blonde hair, and Rola, as well as the entire Yiga Clan, exhibit black hair. Rola and as the elderly couple Steen and Trissa have brown skin; the other members have skin ranging from pale to tan.\n\n===Subrosian===\n{{nihongo|Subrosians|\u30a6\u30fc\u30e9|\u016ara}} are a mysterious race that live in the subterranean world of Subrosia in ''Oracle of Seasons''. They have large glowing eyes and are always seen wearing either green, blue or red hooded cloaks. There are two exceptions: Rosa, who wears a yellow cloak with a ribbon, and another unnamed yellow-clothed Subrosian who gives Link a Secret to use in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are shy when around people of other races and prefer to be rarely seen. They can survive in lava and use a currency made of metal rocks found in the ground called Ore Chunks.\n\n===Tokay===\n{{nihongo|Tokay|\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2\u4eba|Tokage-jin|lit. \"lizard people\"}} are green-scaled lizards who reside on Crescent Island in Labrynna in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are known to search for valuable items and be deceitful. They are also expert gardeners which can grow scent seeds from seedlings over a course of four hundred years. They have never seen anyone from other races, so when they see Link, they think he is a Tokay without a tail and call him \"Strange Tokay\".\n\n===Twili===\n{{nihongo|Twili|\u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u6c11|Towairaito no Tami}} are a race that come from the Twilight Realm and first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' They are the descendants of the Dark Interlopers, who were sent to the Twilight Realm by the {{nihongo|Golden Goddesses|\u4e09\u67f1\u306e\u5973\u795e|Mihashira no Megami <small>Three Goddesses</small>}} after trying to seize control of the Sacred Realm. Eventually, they abandoned their plans to rule the Sacred Realm and Hyrule and became peacefully adapted to the Twilight Realm. One member of their race is {{nihongo|[[Midna]]|\u30df\u30c9\u30ca|Midona}}. {{nihongo|Zant|\u30b6\u30f3\u30c8|Zanto}} was also part of this race. He overthrew Midna with Ganon's help and helped Ganon take over Hyrule.\n\nThe skin tone of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, necks, and chest tend to be gray. The Twili have long limbs, necks, and heads, and great variances in appearance.\n\n===Wizzrobes===\n{{nihongo|Wizzrobes|\u30a6\u30a3\u30ba\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Wizur\u014dbu}} are [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] creatures that wear [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] robes and often use fire and ice magic. In ''The Wind Waker,'' they can also summon other enemies and wear [[toucan]]-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda.]]''\n\n''Breath of the Wild'' introduced Electric Wizzrobes, who use Lighting or Thunderstorm Rods. They can teleport and shoot electricity. The other Wizzrobes can also teleport and shoot fire and ice respectively.\n\n===Yeti===\nYetis are creatures that resemble the 'real-life' yeti, but have large beaver-like tails and speak with poor grammar. The females are smaller than the males and wear an armless sweater, showing no arms or tail. {{nihongo|Yeta|\u30de\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3|Mat\u014dnya}} and {{nihongo|Yeto|\u30c9\u30b5\u30f3\u30b3\u30d5|Dosankofu}}, characters who live in Snowpeak Ruins in ''Twilight Princess'' were {{nihongo|[[Yeti]]s|\u96ea\u7537|yukiotoko}}.<ref><!--\"The wife of Yeto.

In the original game and ''Link to the Past'', Zoras were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in ''A Link to the Past'', allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By ''Ocarina of Time'', their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zoras rely heavily on water, and can only live on land for limited time periods.<ref>[[Super Smash Brothers Brawl]] (2008). In game trophy description of the \"Zora\" trophy.</ref> Zoras are mostly seen gracefully swimming about and frolicking in water. Besides routine swimming and sports, Zoras also enjoy music.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040347/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/z.jsp \"Led by their King, the Zoras are peaceful creatures who enjoy music and sports\"]</ref>\n\nMost Zoras do not wear [[clothing]], and they are generally covered in silver [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], which give them a pale blue sheen from a distance. Where humans sometimes have long hair, average Zoras have rear-hanging [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions that resemble tails. These tails undulate periodically, which gives a Zora's head the unique semblance of a fish. They are sometimes depicted as having webbed feet and hands. They lack ears in the traditional sense, but do have pronounced noses and gills on their abdomen. Their fins can be used to fight by extending out to serve as sharp weapons. Zoras lay [[egg]]s to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zoras are [[tadpole]]-like with a circular body and a long, skinny tail ending in a [[wikt:fluke|fluke]].\n\nZora government is apparently [[Monarchy|monarchical]], either ruled by a king, {{nihongo|King Zora|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Kinguz\u014dra}}, or queen, such as Queen {{nihongo|Rutela|\u30eb\u30c6\u30e9|Rutera}} from ''Twilight Princess''. Two different tribes exist: \"river Zora\" are more violent and can shoot fire, while \"sea Zora\" make up the friendly Zoras. The Zora Royal Family is responsible for maintaining order among their people, overseeing care for {{nihongo|Jabu Jabu|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6}}, whom they worship as a guardian god,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', [[King Zora]]: \u201cOur guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear [[Princess Ruto]]!\u201d</ref> and assuring that the waters upon which he and all creatures rely are clean and pure.\n\nThe Zora appear to be extinct in ''The Wind Waker''; a sage named {{nihongo|Laruto|\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8|Raruto}} is encountered in spirit. They may be linked to the {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} race, along with Princess {{nihongo|Ruto|\u30eb\u30c8}}. The Zora typically inhabit fresh water such as Zora River and Lake Hylia, while sea-dwelling Zora are known to appear in Termina (''Majora's Mask'') and Labrynna (''Oracle of Ages'')\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', Link is able to inhabit the body of the Zora Mikau, who was killed by Gerudo pirates, and can use his fins in the same manner as the boomerang.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Zoras are a major part of the game. Link must head to Zora's Domain in Lanayru to meet with King Dorephan and Prince Sidon. The King called for a Hylian because Zora's Domain was in danger of being washed away by Divine Beast Vah Ruta, who was at the East Reservoir Lake. Muzu, a Zora elder and the King's assistant, resents Link, because him and most Zora elders blame Link for the death of the beloved Zora Champion and Princess, Mipha. After realizing that Link has had a special connection with the princess, he tasks Link with finding 20 Shock Arrows from Ploymus Mountain, which is guarded by a Lynel. After retrieving the arrows, Link heads for the East Reservoir Lake to board Vah Ruta. Once he regains control of the beast, Mipha appears as a spirit and grants Link her healing ability. She then moves Vah Ruta to a location that isn't blocked so she can have a direct lock on Hyrule Castle and assist Link in fighting Ganon.\n\n===Creatures===\nNote: Some creatures' outlook may vary in different titles of the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Armos'''|\u30a2\u30e2\u30b9|Amosu}} are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. ''The Minish Cap'' features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Beamos'''|\u30d3\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9|B\u012bmosu}} like Armos are statues built to guard ancient ruins. Beamos sit stationary scanning the room with a single rotating \"eye\". When they spot an intruder they fire off a high powered laser that tracks the target some distance. They first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Biri and Bari'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2|G\u014dria}} are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.\n*'''Blade Traps''': Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Bokoblin'''|\u30dc\u30b3\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Bokoburin}} are demonic goblin-like enemies that wield bladed weapons or clubs. They have red skin and small horns and are very aggressive to intruders. They first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Later, they reappear in ''Skyward Sword'' and ''Breath of the Wild'' as a common enemy. Like Bulblins, they are prone to following particular evil forces, mainly the Demon Lord Ghirahim from ''Skyward Sword''.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Bubbles'''|\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb|Baburu}}, also known as Anti-Fairies or Whisps, are dark fairies that take the form of giant flaming skulls. They can place curses on their victims, the color of their flame denoting the abilities they possess. For example, if a Blue Bubble bites Link he will be temporarily unable to draw his sword. In some games Link can use Magic Powder to turn Bubbles into healing fairies. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Buzz Blobs'''|\u30d0\u30ba\u30d6\u30ed\u30d6|Bazuburobu}} are electrical tapering creatures made of goo. They are passive, but generate large amounts of static electricity when hit. Buzz Blobs deal damage when struck with metal weapons such as swords, with the exception of the Golden Sword, requiring the use of ranged weapons, which can either defeat them instantly or stun them, leaving them vulnerable to sword strikes. They are skinny down near the ground and widen at the top.\n*{{nihongo|'''ChuChus'''|\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|Chuchu}} are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a smiling mouth that have a variety of colors. In ''The Wind Waker'' their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in ''Majora's Mask'', but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' named \"Bit\" and \"Bot\", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In ''Twilight Princess'', after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In ''Skyward Sword'', ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In ''Breath of the Wild'', ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but retain their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-enemies.php#ChuchuBlue |title=Zelda Dungeon Wiki: Enemies: ChuChus |publisher=Zeldadungeon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>\n*{{nihongo|'''Cuccos'''|\u30b3\u30c3\u30b3|Kokko}} are a type of Hylian [[chicken]] commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat. Although Cuccos strongly resemble real-life chickens they differ in several key ways. Most Cuccos can fly short distances and are even strong enough to glide while carrying the weight of an adult man, allowing Link to use them to glide to otherwise unreachable areas. Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. While normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if attacked repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area. Cuccos first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''. They mostly come in white, although ''The Minish Cap'' had gold Cuccos and ''Twilight Princess'' had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well. In ''Ocarina of Time'', there was a single blue Cucco that was used in a trading sequence.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Darknuts'''|\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|T\u0101tonakku}} are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. In ''The Wind Waker'', when their helmets are removed, they are revealed to have jackal-like heads. Some Darknuts also have capes, which must be destroyed before they can be hurt. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''. They reappear in groups at Hyrule Castle. They also appeared in ''Twilight Princess'' for the first time in The Temple of Time, and in several other dungeons thereafter.\n*{{nihongo|'''Deku Babas'''|\u30c7\u30af\u30d0\u30d0|Deku Baba}} are [[Venus fly trap]]-like [[carnivorous plant]]s, that live in forests. They spend much of their time shrunk down springing from the ground whenever their [[root]]s detect the footsteps of potential prey.

Floormasters roam around the room and are visible at all times, while Wallmasters hide on the ceiling out of sight. Also, Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked, whereas Wallmasters do not. Wallmasters first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda'' while Floormasters first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''. Floormasters appeared in ''The Wind Waker'' as a spectral arm and hand that will transport Link to a jail-like holding area if he is caught. They do not split up when attacked.\n*'''Gargoyles''' are statues that appear in ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''.  They shoot fireballs at Link in the underground dungeons.\n*{{nihongo|'''Gibdos'''|\u30ae\u30d6\u30c9|Gibudo}} are undead creatures wrapped like [[mummy|mummies]]. They resemble ReDeads in regards to their slow and zombie-like movement; in some games, setting a Gibdo's bandages alight will reveal a Stalfos or a ReDead underneath. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can use the Gibdo Mask to communicate with them. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Iron Knuckles'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|Aian-nakku}} are heavily armored knights with axes. While they are even slower than the Darknuts, they are the most powerful enemies in their games as they can take four hearts from Link with just one hit and because of that they are often used to guard treasures. They first appeared in ''The Adventure of Link''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Keese'''|\u30ad\u30fc\u30b9|K\u012bsu}} are [[bat]]-like creatures that often lurk in dark places such as caves and dungeons, where they dive bomb unwary travelers attempting to bite off chunks of flesh. Some Keese have the ability to pick up elements they fly through and there are fire, ice, cursed, and electric variants. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Leevers'''|\u30ea\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|R\u012bb\u0101}} are conical [[cactus]]-like monsters that primarily live in sandy areas, such as deserts and beaches. They hide beneath the sand, burrowing to the top to attack in ambush when they sense the footsteps of an intruder. Leevers attack by spinning rapidly and slamming their thorny bodies into their target. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Like Likes'''|\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30af|Raikuraiku}} are yellowish cylindrical monsters that can suck in creatures as large as humans and consume items they carry.

This creature has multiple different variations, consisting of red, blue, white, and silver. The white and silver Lynel only appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. In that game, red and blue Lynel can be found in many places. The white one appears in a lot of places too, but mostly in colder climates. They can be found naturally in Gerudo Highlands and N. Tabantha Snowfield. Every Lynel, except for the one in Shatterback Point northeast of Zora's Domain, will become Silver after being beaten enough. After every Blood Moon, the Lynel's type will change to a stronger variant (i.e. a defeated red Lynel will become a blue Lynel after being defeated). They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Moblins'''|\u30e2\u30ea\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Moriburin}} are humanoid monsters that usually reside in forests. In ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link'', Moblins resembled [[bulldog]]s, but are pig-like in more recent games. They are sometimes accompanied by Pig Warriors, monsters with the same basic form but more porcine characteristics. Both types commonly wield spears, swords, bows, or occasionally massive clubs. They are one of the most common enemies within the games they appear, and are considered \"mighty\", but also \"dumb\".<ref>''The Wind Waker'', Moblin Figurine: \"These mighty enemies swing their long spears with the greatest of ease.\"</ref><ref>''The Minish Cap, Swiftblade: \"Those pig-faced Moblins...You see them around the Minish Woods, right?

In ''Spirit Tracks'', Miniblins were pirates usually led by a \"Big Blin\", a larger, muscled variation that wields a spiked club. In ''Skyward Sword'', they are depicted as fatter and will use their weight in a final attempt to crush Link before dying. In ''Breath of the Wild'', they are taller and lankier and revealed that they are carnivorous and require a diet of meat and fish to maintain their bulky frames. \n**'''Stalmoblin''' are the animated skeletons of Moblins that appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. Like Stalkoblin, their skeletons continue to reanimate as long as a Stalmoblin skull is present. While just as powerful as their living counterparts, they are much easier to defeat by focusing on destroying their skulls.\n*{{nihongo|'''Octoroks'''|\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Okutarokku}} are [[octopus]] monsters that have appeared in almost every ''Legend of Zelda'' game (except for ''Twilight Princess'').

Once when Raghu attacks Sujatha's classmate when he helps her, Sujatha breaks all bonds with Raghu. When Raghu's family move to another village, Sujatha and Raghu do not even say goodbye to each other. Meanwhile, Raghu's father gifts Sujatha with silver anklets and requests her to never remove them to which obliges. Several years pass by. Raghu and Sujatha are farly distanced. Sujatha grows up to be a beautiful teenage girl whereas Raghu becomes a rogue and a womanizer. Everytime his mother speaks of Sujatha, he feels disgusted. He goes to the extent of sleeping with his servant.\n\nMeanwhile, Sujatha goes to college where she meets Venkat. Venkat is from an extremely poor family and does small jobs to survive his only mother, and pay money to the money lender. He has a decent group of friends and they are classmates with Sujatha. Venkat has an instant crush for Sujatha, while Sujatha does not reciprocate. Venkat asks Sujatha to come to the temple festival to which she denies. But in the end, Sujatha comes, indicating that she is in love with Venkat. Venkat and Sujatha start dating and communicate with each other on the train by writing to each other on the black board at the side of the train.\n\nOnce, when building up the courage to board the same compartment in the train as Venkat, Sujatha is spotted by the family astrologer. She goes home scared and as she had expected, the astrologer had told Sujatha's father. Her father tells her that she would be married to Raghu just like decided years ago. Sujatha protests but her father stays firms. This results in Sujatha dropped out from college and staying at home. \n\nRaghu comes for the engagement reluctantly (still thinking their childhood encounter), but instantly falls for her the moment he sees her. He warns Sujatha that she would never go away and marry him in the end. They both are engaged. Sujatha has a Younger sister Kalyani who turns out to be the messenger between her and Venkat. She give message to Venkat  to meet Sujatha at temple. The whole family go to the temple after the engagement and there Sujatha sees Venkat waiting for her.

The country comprises the eastern half of the island of [[Timor]] and the nearby islands of [[Atauro Island|Atauro]] and Jaco. The first inhabitants are thought to be descendant of [[Australoid]] and [[Melanesian]] peoples. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] began to trade with Timor by the early 16th century and [[Portuguese Timor|colonised]] it throughout the mid-century. Skirmishing with the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty for which Portugal ceded the western half of the island. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Battle of Timor|occupied East Timor]] during [[World War II]], but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]].\n\nEast Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975, but was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by neighbouring Indonesia]] nine days later. The country was later incorporated as a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]] afterwards. During the subsequent [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|two-decade occupation]], a campaign of pacification ensued. Although Indonesia did make substantial investment in infrastructures during its occupation in East Timor,<ref>[http://www.idsa-india.org/an-nov-00-9.html Indonesia: From Economic Crisis to Political Turmoil Dr. Udai Bhanu Singh, Research Fellow, IDSA]</ref> dissatisfaction remained widespread. Between 1975 and 1999, there were an estimated about 102,800 conflict-related deaths (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness), the majority of which occurred during the Indonesian occupation.\n\nOn 30 August 1999, in a [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|UN-sponsored referendum]], an overwhelming majority of East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. Immediately following the referendum, [[Pro-Indonesia militia|anti-independence Timorese militias]] \u2013 organised and supported by the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] \u2013 commenced a punitive scorched-earth campaign. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into [[West Timor]] as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure was destroyed during this punitive attack. On 20 September 1999, the [[International Force for East Timor]] (INTERFET) was deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. Following a [[East Timor (transition)|United Nations-administered transition period]], East Timor was internationally recognised as an independent nation on 20 May 2002.\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n{{Main article|Pre-colonial Timor}}\nThe island of [[Timor]] was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped Australasia more generally. As of 2019, the oldest traces of human settlement are 43,000 to 44,000 years old, and were found in the [[Laili (cave)|Laili cave]] in [[Manatuto Municipality]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=Stuart |last2=O'Connor |first2=Sue |last3=Maloney |first3=Tim Ryan |last4=Litster |first4=Mirani |last5=Kealy |first5=Shimona |last6=Fenner |first6=Jack N. |last7=Aplin |first7=Ken |last8=Boulanger |first8=Clara |last9=Brockwell |first9=Sally |last10=Willan |first10=Richard |last11=Piotto |first11=Elena |last12=Louys |first12=Julien |title=Oldest human occupation of Wallacea at Laili Cave, Timor-Leste, shows broad-spectrum foraging responses to late Pleistocene environments |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |date=September 2017 |volume=171 |pages=58\u201372 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.07.008}}</ref> These early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2011/evidence-of-42000-year-old-deep-sea-fishing-revealed |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515133750/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2011/evidence-of-42000-year-old-deep-sea-fishing-revealed |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> One of the oldest fish hooks in the world, dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old, was excavated at the [[Jerimalai (cave)|Jerimalai cave]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=S. |last2=Ono |first2=R. |last3=Clarkson |first3=C. |title=Pelagic Fishing at 42,000 Years Before the Present and the Maritime Skills of Modern Humans |journal=Science |date=24 November 2011 |volume=334 |issue=6059 |pages=1117\u20131121 |doi=10.1126/science.1207703|pmid=22116883 }}</ref> It is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country.

Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 378\"/>\n\nSeveral fortifications uncovered in Timor were built between 1000 and 1300. Climatic changes, in particular during the [[Little Ice Age]], and the increased trade in sandalwood, are thought to have increased tensions around the control of resources during that time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Connor |first1=Sue |last2=McWilliam |first2=Andrew |last3=Fenner |first3=Jack N. |last4=Brockwell |first4=Sally |title=Examining the Origin of Fortifications in East Timor: Social and Environmental Factors |journal=The Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology |date=May 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=200\u2013218 |doi=10.1080/15564894.2011.619245}}</ref>\n\nThe first known mention of Timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century Chinese [[Zhu Fan Zhi]], which describes various products and civilizations found outside China. In the Zhu Fan Zhi, Timor is called ''Ti-Wen'' and is noted for its sandalwood. In 1365, the [[Nagarakretagama]], which contains descriptions of the Majapahit Empire at its peak, identifies Timor as an island within Majapahit's realm. However, as Portuguese chronologist Tom\u00e9 Pires wrote in the 16th century, all islands east of Java were called \"Timor\".<ref>[http://www.uc.pt/timor/CURSO1A.HTM Population Settlements in East Timor and Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202035244/http://www.uc.pt/Timor/CURSO1A.HTM |date=2 February 1999 }} \u2013 University of Coimbra</ref>\n\nEarly European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century.

These Portuguese were traders that arrived between 1512 and 1515. However, only in 1556 did a group of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Dominican friar|friars]] establish their missionary work in the area. By the seventeenth century the village of [[Lifau]] - today part of the [[Oecusse District|Oecussi]] enclave - became the centre of Portuguese activities. At this time, the Portuguese began to convert the Timorese to Catholicism. Starting in 1642, a military expedition led by the Portuguese Francisco Fernandes took place. The aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the Timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the [[Topasses]], the 'Black Portuguese', it succeeded to extend the Portuguese influence into the interior of the country.  In 1702 the territory officially became a Portuguese colony, known as [[Portuguese Timor]], when [[Lisbon]] sent its first governor, with [[Lifau]] as its capital. Portuguese control over the territory was tenuous particularly in the mountainous interior. [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars, the occasional Dutch raid, and the Timorese themselves provided opposition to the Portuguese. The control of colonial administrators, largely restricted to [[Dili]], had to rely on traditional tribal chieftains for control and influence.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994 198\">{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 198] |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=1-86373-635-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 }}</ref>\n\nFor the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health,  and education was minimal. The island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in Lisbon saw as \"problems\" - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals. Portuguese ruled through a traditional system of liurai (local chiefs). Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994 198\"/>\n\nThe capital was moved from Lifau to [[Dili]] in 1769, due to attacks from the [[Topasses]], an independent-minded Eurasian group. Meanwhile, the Dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now [[Indonesia]]. The border between Portuguese Timor and the Dutch East Indies was formally decided in 1859 with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1859)|Treaty of Lisbon]]. Portugal received the eastern half, together with the north coast pocket of Oecussi. In 1910\u201312, the [[East Timorese rebellion of 1910\u201312|East Timorese rebelled]] against Portugal. Troops from Mozambique and naval gunfire were brought in to suppress the rebels. The definitive border was drawn by [[The Hague]] in 1914,<ref>Deeley, Furness, and Schofield (2001) ''The International Boundaries of East Timor'' p. 8</ref> and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of East Timor and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough Portugal was neutral during [[World War II]], in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by [[Australia]]n and Dutch forces, which were expecting a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion. This Australian military intervention dragged Portuguese Timor into the Pacific War but it also slowed the Japanese expansion. When the Japanese did occupy Timor, in February 1942, a 400-strong Dutch-Australian force and large numbers of Timorese volunteers engaged them in [[Battle of Timor (1942\u201343)|a one-year guerilla campaign]].  After the allied evacuation in February 1943 the East Timorese continued fighting the Japanese, with comparatively little [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with the enemy taking place. This assistance cost the civilian population dearly: Japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies. The Japanese occupation resulted in the deaths of 40,000\u201370,000 Timorese.\n\nPortuguese Timor was handed back to Portugal after the war, but Portugal continued to neglect the colony. Very little investment was made in infrastructure, education and healthcare. The colony was declared an 'Overseas Province' of the Portuguese Republic in 1955. Locally, authority rested with the Portuguese Governor and the Legislative Council, as well as local chiefs or ''liurai''.  Only a small minority of Timorese were educated, and even fewer went on to university in Portugal (there were no universities in the territory until 2000).\n\nDuring this time, [[Indonesia]] did not express any interest in Portuguese Timor, despite the anti-colonial rhetoric of President [[Sukarno]]. This was partly as Indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of [[West Irian]], now called Papua, which had been retained by the [[Netherlands]] after Indonesian independence. In fact, at the [[United Nations]], Indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former Netherlands East Indies, explicitly mentioning Portuguese Timor.\n\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Decolonisation, coup, and independence==\nThe decolonisation process instigated by [[Carnation Revolution|the 1974 Portuguese revolution]] saw Portugal effectively abandon the colony of Portuguese Timor. A civil war between supporters of Portuguese Timorese political parties, [[Fretilin]] and the [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]], broke out in 1975 as UDT attempted a coup which Fretilin resisted with the help of local Portuguese military.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ricklefs |first=M. C. |title=A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300 |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan |year=1991 |page=301|isbn=0-333-57689-6}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first acts of the new government in [[Lisbon]] was to appoint a new Governor for the colony on 18 November 1974, in the form of [[M\u00e1rio Lemos Pires]], who would ultimately be, as events were to prove, the last Governor of Portuguese Timor.\n\nOne of his first decrees made upon his arrival in [[Dili]] was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a [[Constituent Assembly]] in 1976. Three main political parties were formed:\n\n* The ''Uni\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' ([[Timorese Democratic Union|Timorese Democratic Union or UDT]]), was supported by the traditional elites, initially argued for a continued association with Lisbon, or as they put it in [[Tetum]], ''mate bandera hum'' \u2014 'in the shadow of the [Portuguese] flag', but later adopted a 'gradualist' approach to independence. One of its leaders, M\u00e1rio Viegas Carrascal\u00e3o, one of the few Timorese to have been educated at university in [[Portugal]], later became [[Indonesia]]n Governor of East Timor during the 1980s and early 1990s, although with the demise of Indonesian rule, he would change to supporting independence.\n* The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Social Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' (Timorese Social Democratic Association ASDT) supported a rapid movement to independence. It later changed its name to ''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'' (Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor or [[Fretilin]]). Fretilin was regarded by many in [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]] as being Marxist, its name sounding reminiscent of [[FRELIMO]] in [[Mozambique]]. The party committed itself to \"the universal doctrines of socialism\".\n* The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Popular Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' ([[Timorese Popular Democratic Association]] or \"Apodeti\") supported integration with Indonesia, as an autonomous province, but had little grassroots support. One of its leaders, Ab\u00edlio Os\u00f3rio Soares, later served as the last Indonesian-appointed Governor of East Timor. Apodeti drew support from a few ''liurai'' in the border region, some of whom had collaborated with the [[Japan]]ese during the [[Second World War]]. It also had some support in the small [[Muslim]] minority, although [[Mar\u00ed Alkatiri]], a Muslim, was a prominent Fretilin leader, and became Prime Minister in 2002.\n\nOther smaller parties included ''Klibur Oan Timur Asuwain'' or KOTA whose name translated from the [[Tetum]] language as 'Sons of the Mountain Warriors', which sought to create a form of [[monarchy]] involving the local ''liurai'', and the ''Partido Trabalhista'' or Labour Party, but neither had any significant support. They would, however, collaborate with Indonesia. The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica para a Integra\u00e7\u00e3o de Timor-Leste na Austr\u00e1lia''  (ADITLA), advocated integration with [[Australia]], but folded after the [[Australia]]n government emphatically ruled out the idea.\n\n===Parties compete, foreign powers take interest===\nDevelopments in Portuguese Timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by [[Indonesia]] and [[Australia]]. [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\"]], which had effectively eliminated Indonesia's Communist Party [[Communist Party of Indonesia|PKI]] in 1965, was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning Fretilin, and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago.\n\nAustralia's Labor Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], had developed a close working relationship with the Indonesian leader, and also followed events with concern. At a meeting in the [[Javanese language|Java]]nese town of [[Wonosobo]] in 1974, he told Suharto that an independent Portuguese Timor would be 'an unviable state, and a potential threat to the stability of the region'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/03/whit-m09.html|title=Leaked documents reveal Australian Labor leader's East Timor role|last=Head|first=Mike|date=9 March 1999|website=World Socialist Web Site|access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> While recognising the need for an act of self-determination, he considered integration with Indonesia to be in Portuguese Timor's best interests.\n\nIn local elections on 13 March 1975, Fretilin and UDT emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence.\n\nIndonesian military intelligence, known as BAKIN, began attempting to cause divisions between the pro-independence parties, and promote the support of Apodeti. This was known as ''Operasi Komodo'' or 'Operation Komodo' after the giant [[Komodo dragon|Komodo]] lizard found in the eastern Indonesian island of the same name. Many Indonesian military figures held meetings with UDT leaders, who made it plain that [[Jakarta]] would not tolerate a Fretilin-led administration in an independent East Timor. The coalition between Fretilin and UDT later broke up.\n\nDuring the course of 1975, Portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony, becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises, and more concerned with decolonisation in its [[Africa]]n colonies of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] than with Portuguese Timor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.easttimorgovernment.com/history.htm|title=East Timor History|website=www.easttimorgovernment.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> Many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic, and were open to discussions with Jakarta over Portuguese Timor's incorporation into the Indonesian state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The coup===\nOn 11 August 1975, the UDT mounted a coup, in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of Fretilin. Governor Pires fled to the offshore island of [[Atauro]], north of the capital, [[Dili]], from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides. He was urged by Fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process, but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in Lisbon, now increasingly uninterested.\n\nIndonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war, which had plunged Portuguese Timor into chaos, but after only a month, aid and relief agencies from [[Australia]] and elsewhere visited the territory, and reported that the situation was stable. Nevertheless, many UDT supporters had fled across the border into Indonesian Timor, where they were coerced into supporting integration with Indonesia. In October 1975, in the border town of [[Balibo]], two Australian television crews (the \"[[Balibo Five]]\") reporting on the conflict were killed by Indonesian forces, after they witnessed Indonesian incursions into Portuguese Timor.\n\n===Break from Portugal===\nWhile Fretilin had sought the return of the Portuguese Governor, pointedly flying the Portuguese flag from government offices, the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support, independently of Portugal.\n\nOn 28 November 1975, Fretilin made a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] of the ''Democratic Republic of East Timor'' (''Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica de Timor-Leste'' in Portuguese). This was not recognised by either Portugal, Indonesia, or Australia; however, the UDI state received formal diplomatic recognition from six countries that were led by leftist or Marxist\u2013Leninist parties, namely [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]. Fretilin's [[Francisco Xavier do Amaral]] became the first President, while Fretilin leader [[Nicolau dos Reis Lobato]] was Prime Minister.\n\nIndonesia's response was to have UDT, Apodeti, KOTA and Trabalhista leaders sign a declaration calling for integration with Indonesia called the ''[[Balibo]] Declaration'', although it was drafted by Indonesian intelligence and signed in [[Bali]], Indonesia not Balibo, Portuguese Timor. [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]], now the country's Prime Minister, described this as the 'Balibohong Declaration', a [[pun]] on the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word for 'lie'.\n\n===East Timor solidarity movement===\nAn international ''East Timor solidarity movement'' arose in response to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|1975 invasion]] of East Timor by Indonesia and the occupation that followed. The movement was supported by churches, human rights groups, and peace campaigners, but developed its own organisations and infrastructure in many countries. Many demonstrations and vigils backed legislative actions to cut off military supplies to Indonesia. The movement was most extensive in neighbouring [[Australia]], in [[Portugal]], in the [[Philippines]] and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, but had significant force in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Europe]].\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta]], later President of East Timor, stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement \"was instrumental. They were like our peaceful foot soldiers, and fought many battles for us.\"\n\n==Indonesian invasion and annexation==\n{{Main article|Indonesian invasion of East Timor}}\nThe Indonesian invasion of East Timor began on 7 December 1975. [[Indonesia]]n forces launched a massive air and sea invasion, known as ''Operasi Seroja'', or 'Operation Komodo', almost entirely using US-supplied equipment even if Kissinger feared this would be revealed to the public.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB174/1010.pdf GWU.edu]</ref> Moreover, according to declassified documents released by the National Security Archive (NSA) in December 2001, USA gave its agreement to Indonesia for the invasion.  In fact, when the Indonesian president Suharto asked the understanding of taking rapid drastic action in East Timor to the American president, President Ford replied, \"We will understand and not press you on the issue.  We understand the problem and the intentions you have.\"\nAustralian government did not react to this invasion. The reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between Indonesia and Australia.  This lack of action resulted in massive protests by Australian citizens remembering the heroic actions of the Timorese during World War II.\n\nIn an effort to stamp greater control over its dissident new province - whose seizure was condemned by the United Nations - Indonesia invested considerable sums in Timor-Leste leading to more rapid economic growth which averaged 6% per year over the period 1983-1997.  Unlike the Portuguese, the Indonesians favoured strong, direct rule, which was never accepted by the Timorese people who were determined to preserve their culture and national identity.\nBy 1976 there were 35,000 Indonesian troops in East Timor. Falintil, the military wing of Fretilin, fought a guerrilla war with marked success in the first few years but weakened considerably thereafter. The cost of the brutal takeover to the East Timorese was huge; it\u2019s estimated that at least 100,000 died in the hostilities, and ensuing disease and famine. Other reported death tolls from the 24-year occupation range from 60,000 to 200,000.<ref name=\"aiusa01\">[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=30AE6F0E6ABBA62A802569A60060395F AmnestyUSA.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714151015/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=30AE6F0E6ABBA62A802569A60060395F |date=14 July 2007 }}, \"Indonesia/East Timor: Seven East Timorese Still in Danger\".

Troop numbers were increased and draconian controls were imposed on the population, isolating the territory from the outside world.\n\nA [[puppet government|puppet]] <nowiki>''Provisional Government of East Timor''</nowiki> was installed in mid-December, consisting of Apodeti and UDT leaders. Attempts by the [[United Nations Secretary General]]'s Special Representative, [[Vittorio Winspeare-Guicciardi]] to visit Fretilin-held areas from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]], were obstructed by the Indonesian military, which blockaded East Timor.  On 31 May 1976, a 'People's Assembly' in Dili, selected by Indonesian intelligence, unanimously endorsed an 'Act of Integration', and on 17 July, East Timor officially became the 27th province of the Republic of Indonesia ([[East Timor (province)|Timor Timur]]). The occupation of East Timor remained a public issue in many nations, Portugal in particular, and the UN never recognised either the regime installed by the Indonesians or the subsequent annexation. We can refer to the resolution approved by the United nations General Assembly on 12 December 1975, saying \"having heard the statements of the representatives of Portugal, as the Administering Power, concerning developments in Portuguese Timor...deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of Indonesia in Portuguese Timor and calls upon the Government of Indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the Territory...and recommends that the Security Council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of Portuguese Timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination\".\n\nWestern countries were criticised because they supported the Indonesian invasion. Indeed, they supported it by selling arms or making offerings of aid (it is believed that the United States provided 90% of Indonesia's arms), by making some military training programs in Indonesia, by not covering the events taking place in Timor, or by saying that the deaths were due to former conflicts.\n\nBy 1989, Indonesia had things firmly under control and opened East Timor to tourism. Then, on 12 November 1991 Indonesian troops fired on protesters gathered at the Santa Cruz Cemetery in Dili to commemorate the killing of an independence activist. With the event captured on film and aired around the world, the embarrassed Indonesian government admitted to 19 killings, although it\u2019s estimated that over 200 died in the massacre.\n\nWhile Indonesia introduced a civilian administration, the military remained in control. Aided by secret police and civilian Timorese militia to crush dissent, reports of arrest, torture, and murder were numerous.\n\n== Towards independence ==\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the Santa Cruz [[Dili massacre]], November 1998]] \nTimorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against Indonesian forces for the independence of East Timor, during which many atrocities and [[human rights]] violations by the Indonesian army were reported.

In [[Australia]], there was also widespread public outrage, and criticism of Canberra's close relationship with the Suharto regime and recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over East Timor. This caused the Australian government embarrassment, but Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] played down the killings, describing them as \"an aberration, not an act of state policy\". Prime Minister Keating's first overseas trip was to Indonesia in April 1992 and sought to improve trade and cultural relations, but  repression of the East Timorese continued to mar co-operation between the two nations.<ref name=\"primeministers.naa.gov.au\">http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/keating/in-office.aspx</ref>\n\nGareth Evans and Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] (1991\u20131996) gave maintenance of close relations with the Indonesian government a high priority, as did the subsequent Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] during their first term in office (1996\u20131998).

While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics in 1975, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. During the occupation, [[Bishop]] [[Carlos Ximenes Belo]] became one of the most prominent advocates for [[human rights]] in East Timor and many priests and nuns risked their lives in defending citizens from military abuses. [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]]'s 1989 visit to East Timor exposed the occupied territory's situation to world media and provided a catalyst for independence activists to seek global support. Officially neutral, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] wished to retain good relations with the Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation. Upon his arrival in East Timor, the Pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground, alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation, and yet avoiding overtly suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country.

In late 1998, the Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] with his Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] drafted a letter setting out a major change in Australian policy. The letter supported the idea of autonomy but went much further by suggesting that the East Timores be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade. The letter upset Habibie, who saw it as implying Indonesia was a \"colonial power\" and he decided in response to announce a snap referendum to be conducted within six months.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nNews of the proposal provoked a violent reaction in East Timor from pro-Indonesian militia. The Indonesian army did not intervene to restore order. At a summit in Bali John Howard told Habibie that a United Nations Peace Keeping force should oversee the process.

Approximately 1,400 Timorese were killed and 300,000 forcibly pushed into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed.\n\nActivists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. The violence was met with widespread public anger in Australia. The Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Labor's [[Laurie Brereton]], was vocal in highlighting evidence of the Indonesian military's involvement in pro-integrationist violence and advocated United Nations peacekeeping to support the East Timor's ballot. The [[Catholic Church in Australia]] urged the Australian Government to send an armed peacekeeping force to [[East Timor]] to end the violence.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-23049715.html</ref> Street protesters harried the Indonesian Embassy.\n\n[[File:K-CNRT rally Dili 07'99-25.jpg|thumb|East Timorese independence referendum, 1999]]\nJohn Howard conferred with United Nations Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and lobbied [[U.

The United States offered crucial logistical and intelligence resources and an \"over-horizon\" deterrent presence.

The country comprises the eastern half of the island of [[Timor]] and the nearby islands of [[Atauro Island|Atauro]] and Jaco. The first inhabitants are thought to be descendant of [[Australoid]] and [[Melanesian]] peoples. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] began to trade with Timor by the early 16th century and [[Portuguese Timor|colonised]] it throughout the mid-century. Skirmishing with the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty for which Portugal ceded the western half of the island. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Battle of Timor|occupied East Timor]] during [[World War II]], but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]].\n\nEast Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975, but was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by neighbouring Indonesia]] nine days later. The country was later incorporated as a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]] afterwards. During the subsequent [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|two-decade occupation]], a campaign of pacification ensued. Although Indonesia did make substantial investment in infrastructures during its occupation in East Timor,<ref>[http://www.idsa-india.org/an-nov-00-9.html Indonesia: From Economic Crisis to Political Turmoil Dr. Udai Bhanu Singh, Research Fellow, IDSA]</ref> dissatisfaction remained widespread. Between 1975 and 1999, there were an estimated about 102,800 conflict-related deaths (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness), the majority of which occurred during the Indonesian occupation.\n\nOn 30 August 1999, in a [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|UN-sponsored referendum]], an overwhelming majority of East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. Immediately following the referendum, [[Pro-Indonesia militia|anti-independence Timorese militias]] \u2013 organised and supported by the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] \u2013 commenced a punitive scorched-earth campaign. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into [[West Timor]] as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure was destroyed during this punitive attack. On 20 September 1999, the [[International Force for East Timor]] (INTERFET) was deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. Following a [[East Timor (transition)|United Nations-administered transition period]], East Timor was internationally recognised as an independent nation on 20 May 2002.\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\n{{Main article|Pre-colonial Timor}}\nThe island of [[Timor]] was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped Australasia more generally.

Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 378\"/>\n\nSeveral fortifications uncovered in Timor were built between 1000 and 1300.

In the Zhu Fan Zhi, Timor is called ''Ti-Wen'' and is noted for its sandalwood. In 1365, the [[Nagarakretagama]], which contains descriptions of the Majapahit Empire at its peak, identifies Timor as an island within Majapahit's realm. However, as Portuguese chronologist Tom\u00e9 Pires wrote in the 16th century, all islands east of Java were called \"Timor\".<ref>[http://www.uc.pt/timor/CURSO1A.HTM Population Settlements in East Timor and Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202035244/http://www.uc.pt/Timor/CURSO1A.HTM |date=2 February 1999 }} \u2013 University of Coimbra</ref>\n\nEarly European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century.

These Portuguese were traders that arrived between 1512 and 1515. However, only in 1556 did a group of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Dominican friar|friars]] establish their missionary work in the area. By the seventeenth century the village of [[Lifau]] - today part of the [[Oecusse District|Oecussi]] enclave - became the centre of Portuguese activities. At this time, the Portuguese began to convert the Timorese to Catholicism. Starting in 1642, a military expedition led by the Portuguese Francisco Fernandes took place. The aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the Timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the [[Topasses]], the 'Black Portuguese', it succeeded to extend the Portuguese influence into the interior of the country.  In 1702 the territory officially became a Portuguese colony, known as [[Portuguese Timor]], when [[Lisbon]] sent its first governor, with [[Lifau]] as its capital. Portuguese control over the territory was tenuous particularly in the mountainous interior. [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars, the occasional Dutch raid, and the Timorese themselves provided opposition to the Portuguese. The control of colonial administrators, largely restricted to [[Dili]], had to rely on traditional tribal chieftains for control and influence.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994 198\">{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 198] |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=1-86373-635-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 }}</ref>\n\nFor the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century. Investment in infrastructure, health,  and education was minimal. The island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in Lisbon saw as \"problems\" - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals. Portuguese ruled through a traditional system of liurai (local chiefs). Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. In places where Portuguese rule was asserted, it tended to be brutal and exploitative. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994 198\"/>\n\nThe capital was moved from Lifau to [[Dili]] in 1769, due to attacks from the [[Topasses]], an independent-minded Eurasian group. Meanwhile, the Dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now [[Indonesia]]. The border between Portuguese Timor and the Dutch East Indies was formally decided in 1859 with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1859)|Treaty of Lisbon]]. Portugal received the eastern half, together with the north coast pocket of Oecussi. In 1910\u201312, the [[East Timorese rebellion of 1910\u201312|East Timorese rebelled]] against Portugal. Troops from Mozambique and naval gunfire were brought in to suppress the rebels. The definitive border was drawn by [[The Hague]] in 1914,<ref>Deeley, Furness, and Schofield (2001) ''The International Boundaries of East Timor'' p. 8</ref> and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of East Timor and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough Portugal was neutral during [[World War II]], in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by [[Australia]]n and Dutch forces, which were expecting a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion. This Australian military intervention dragged Portuguese Timor into the Pacific War but it also slowed the Japanese expansion. When the Japanese did occupy Timor, in February 1942, a 400-strong Dutch-Australian force and large numbers of Timorese volunteers engaged them in [[Battle of Timor (1942\u201343)|a one-year guerilla campaign]].  After the allied evacuation in February 1943 the East Timorese continued fighting the Japanese, with comparatively little [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with the enemy taking place. This assistance cost the civilian population dearly: Japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies. The Japanese occupation resulted in the deaths of 40,000\u201370,000 Timorese.\n\nPortuguese Timor was handed back to Portugal after the war, but Portugal continued to neglect the colony. Very little investment was made in infrastructure, education and healthcare. The colony was declared an 'Overseas Province' of the Portuguese Republic in 1955. Locally, authority rested with the Portuguese Governor and the Legislative Council, as well as local chiefs or ''liurai''.  Only a small minority of Timorese were educated, and even fewer went on to university in Portugal (there were no universities in the territory until 2000).\n\nDuring this time, [[Indonesia]] did not express any interest in Portuguese Timor, despite the anti-colonial rhetoric of President [[Sukarno]]. This was partly as Indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of [[West Irian]], now called Papua, which had been retained by the [[Netherlands]] after Indonesian independence. In fact, at the [[United Nations]], Indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former Netherlands East Indies, explicitly mentioning Portuguese Timor.\n\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Decolonisation, coup, and independence==\nThe decolonisation process instigated by [[Carnation Revolution|the 1974 Portuguese revolution]] saw Portugal effectively abandon the colony of Portuguese Timor. A civil war between supporters of Portuguese Timorese political parties, [[Fretilin]] and the [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]], broke out in 1975 as UDT attempted a coup which Fretilin resisted with the help of local Portuguese military.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ricklefs |first=M. C. |title=A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300 |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan |year=1991 |page=301|isbn=0-333-57689-6}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first acts of the new government in [[Lisbon]] was to appoint a new Governor for the colony on 18 November 1974, in the form of [[M\u00e1rio Lemos Pires]], who would ultimately be, as events were to prove, the last Governor of Portuguese Timor.\n\nOne of his first decrees made upon his arrival in [[Dili]] was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a [[Constituent Assembly]] in 1976. Three main political parties were formed:\n\n* The ''Uni\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' ([[Timorese Democratic Union|Timorese Democratic Union or UDT]]), was supported by the traditional elites, initially argued for a continued association with Lisbon, or as they put it in [[Tetum]], ''mate bandera hum'' \u2014 'in the shadow of the [Portuguese] flag', but later adopted a 'gradualist' approach to independence. One of its leaders, M\u00e1rio Viegas Carrascal\u00e3o, one of the few Timorese to have been educated at university in [[Portugal]], later became [[Indonesia]]n Governor of East Timor during the 1980s and early 1990s, although with the demise of Indonesian rule, he would change to supporting independence.\n* The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Social Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' (Timorese Social Democratic Association ASDT) supported a rapid movement to independence. It later changed its name to ''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'' (Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor or [[Fretilin]]). Fretilin was regarded by many in [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]] as being Marxist, its name sounding reminiscent of [[FRELIMO]] in [[Mozambique]]. The party committed itself to \"the universal doctrines of socialism\".\n* The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Popular Democr\u00e1tica Timorense'' ([[Timorese Popular Democratic Association]] or \"Apodeti\") supported integration with Indonesia, as an autonomous province, but had little grassroots support. One of its leaders, Ab\u00edlio Os\u00f3rio Soares, later served as the last Indonesian-appointed Governor of East Timor. Apodeti drew support from a few ''liurai'' in the border region, some of whom had collaborated with the [[Japan]]ese during the [[Second World War]]. It also had some support in the small [[Muslim]] minority, although [[Mar\u00ed Alkatiri]], a Muslim, was a prominent Fretilin leader, and became Prime Minister in 2002.\n\nOther smaller parties included ''Klibur Oan Timur Asuwain'' or KOTA whose name translated from the [[Tetum]] language as 'Sons of the Mountain Warriors', which sought to create a form of [[monarchy]] involving the local ''liurai'', and the ''Partido Trabalhista'' or Labour Party, but neither had any significant support. They would, however, collaborate with Indonesia. The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica para a Integra\u00e7\u00e3o de Timor-Leste na Austr\u00e1lia''  (ADITLA), advocated integration with [[Australia]], but folded after the [[Australia]]n government emphatically ruled out the idea.\n\n===Parties compete, foreign powers take interest===\nDevelopments in Portuguese Timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by [[Indonesia]] and [[Australia]]. [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\"]], which had effectively eliminated Indonesia's Communist Party [[Communist Party of Indonesia|PKI]] in 1965, was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning Fretilin, and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago.\n\nAustralia's Labor Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], had developed a close working relationship with the Indonesian leader, and also followed events with concern. At a meeting in the [[Javanese language|Java]]nese town of [[Wonosobo]] in 1974, he told Suharto that an independent Portuguese Timor would be 'an unviable state, and a potential threat to the stability of the region'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/03/whit-m09.html|title=Leaked documents reveal Australian Labor leader's East Timor role|last=Head|first=Mike|date=9 March 1999|website=World Socialist Web Site|access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> While recognising the need for an act of self-determination, he considered integration with Indonesia to be in Portuguese Timor's best interests.\n\nIn local elections on 13 March 1975, Fretilin and UDT emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence.\n\nIndonesian military intelligence, known as BAKIN, began attempting to cause divisions between the pro-independence parties, and promote the support of Apodeti. This was known as ''Operasi Komodo'' or 'Operation Komodo' after the giant [[Komodo dragon|Komodo]] lizard found in the eastern Indonesian island of the same name. Many Indonesian military figures held meetings with UDT leaders, who made it plain that [[Jakarta]] would not tolerate a Fretilin-led administration in an independent East Timor. The coalition between Fretilin and UDT later broke up.\n\nDuring the course of 1975, Portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony, becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises, and more concerned with decolonisation in its [[Africa]]n colonies of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] than with Portuguese Timor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.easttimorgovernment.com/history.htm|title=East Timor History|website=www.easttimorgovernment.com|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> Many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic, and were open to discussions with Jakarta over Portuguese Timor's incorporation into the Indonesian state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The coup===\nOn 11 August 1975, the UDT mounted a coup, in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of Fretilin. Governor Pires fled to the offshore island of [[Atauro]], north of the capital, [[Dili]], from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides. He was urged by Fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process, but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in Lisbon, now increasingly uninterested.\n\nIndonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war, which had plunged Portuguese Timor into chaos, but after only a month, aid and relief agencies from [[Australia]] and elsewhere visited the territory, and reported that the situation was stable. Nevertheless, many UDT supporters had fled across the border into Indonesian Timor, where they were coerced into supporting integration with Indonesia. In October 1975, in the border town of [[Balibo]], two Australian television crews (the \"[[Balibo Five]]\") reporting on the conflict were killed by Indonesian forces, after they witnessed Indonesian incursions into Portuguese Timor.\n\n===Break from Portugal===\nWhile Fretilin had sought the return of the Portuguese Governor, pointedly flying the Portuguese flag from government offices, the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support, independently of Portugal.\n\nOn 28 November 1975, Fretilin made a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] of the ''Democratic Republic of East Timor'' (''Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica de Timor-Leste'' in Portuguese). This was not recognised by either Portugal, Indonesia, or Australia; however, the UDI state received formal diplomatic recognition from six countries that were led by leftist or Marxist\u2013Leninist parties, namely [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]. Fretilin's [[Francisco Xavier do Amaral]] became the first President, while Fretilin leader [[Nicolau dos Reis Lobato]] was Prime Minister.\n\nIndonesia's response was to have UDT, Apodeti, KOTA and Trabalhista leaders sign a declaration calling for integration with Indonesia called the ''[[Balibo]] Declaration'', although it was drafted by Indonesian intelligence and signed in [[Bali]], Indonesia not Balibo, Portuguese Timor. [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]], now the country's Prime Minister, described this as the 'Balibohong Declaration', a [[pun]] on the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word for 'lie'.\n\n===East Timor solidarity movement===\nAn international ''East Timor solidarity movement'' arose in response to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|1975 invasion]] of East Timor by Indonesia and the occupation that followed. The movement was supported by churches, human rights groups, and peace campaigners, but developed its own organisations and infrastructure in many countries. Many demonstrations and vigils backed legislative actions to cut off military supplies to Indonesia. The movement was most extensive in neighbouring [[Australia]], in [[Portugal]], in the [[Philippines]] and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, but had significant force in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Europe]].\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta]], later President of East Timor, stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement \"was instrumental. They were like our peaceful foot soldiers, and fought many battles for us.\"\n\n==Indonesian invasion and annexation==\n{{Main article|Indonesian invasion of East Timor}}\nThe Indonesian invasion of East Timor began on 7 December 1975. [[Indonesia]]n forces launched a massive air and sea invasion, known as ''Operasi Seroja'', or 'Operation Komodo', almost entirely using US-supplied equipment even if Kissinger feared this would be revealed to the public.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB174/1010.pdf GWU.edu]</ref> Moreover, according to declassified documents released by the National Security Archive (NSA) in December 2001, USA gave its agreement to Indonesia for the invasion.  In fact, when the Indonesian president Suharto asked the understanding of taking rapid drastic action in East Timor to the American president, President Ford replied, \"We will understand and not press you on the issue.  We understand the problem and the intentions you have.\"\nAustralian government did not react to this invasion. The reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between Indonesia and Australia.  This lack of action resulted in massive protests by Australian citizens remembering the heroic actions of the Timorese during World War II.\n\nIn an effort to stamp greater control over its dissident new province - whose seizure was condemned by the United Nations - Indonesia invested considerable sums in Timor-Leste leading to more rapid economic growth which averaged 6% per year over the period 1983-1997.  Unlike the Portuguese, the Indonesians favoured strong, direct rule, which was never accepted by the Timorese people who were determined to preserve their culture and national identity.\nBy 1976 there were 35,000 Indonesian troops in East Timor. Falintil, the military wing of Fretilin, fought a guerrilla war with marked success in the first few years but weakened considerably thereafter. The cost of the brutal takeover to the East Timorese was huge; it\u2019s estimated that at least 100,000 died in the hostilities, and ensuing disease and famine. Other reported death tolls from the 24-year occupation range from 60,000 to 200,000.<ref name=\"aiusa01\">[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=30AE6F0E6ABBA62A802569A60060395F AmnestyUSA.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714151015/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=30AE6F0E6ABBA62A802569A60060395F |date=14 July 2007 }}, \"Indonesia/East Timor: Seven East Timorese Still in Danger\".

Troop numbers were increased and draconian controls were imposed on the population, isolating the territory from the outside world.\n\nA [[puppet government|puppet]] <nowiki>''Provisional Government of East Timor''</nowiki> was installed in mid-December, consisting of Apodeti and UDT leaders. Attempts by the [[United Nations Secretary General]]'s Special Representative, [[Vittorio Winspeare-Guicciardi]] to visit Fretilin-held areas from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]], were obstructed by the Indonesian military, which blockaded East Timor.  On 31 May 1976, a 'People's Assembly' in Dili, selected by Indonesian intelligence, unanimously endorsed an 'Act of Integration', and on 17 July, East Timor officially became the 27th province of the Republic of Indonesia ([[East Timor (province)|Timor Timur]]). The occupation of East Timor remained a public issue in many nations, Portugal in particular, and the UN never recognised either the regime installed by the Indonesians or the subsequent annexation. We can refer to the resolution approved by the United nations General Assembly on 12 December 1975, saying \"having heard the statements of the representatives of Portugal, as the Administering Power, concerning developments in Portuguese Timor...deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of Indonesia in Portuguese Timor and calls upon the Government of Indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the Territory...and recommends that the Security Council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of Portuguese Timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination\".\n\nWestern countries were criticised because they supported the Indonesian invasion. Indeed, they supported it by selling arms or making offerings of aid (it is believed that the United States provided 90% of Indonesia's arms), by making some military training programs in Indonesia, by not covering the events taking place in Timor, or by saying that the deaths were due to former conflicts.\n\nBy 1989, Indonesia had things firmly under control and opened East Timor to tourism. Then, on 12 November 1991 Indonesian troops fired on protesters gathered at the Santa Cruz Cemetery in Dili to commemorate the killing of an independence activist. With the event captured on film and aired around the world, the embarrassed Indonesian government admitted to 19 killings, although it\u2019s estimated that over 200 died in the massacre.\n\nWhile Indonesia introduced a civilian administration, the military remained in control. Aided by secret police and civilian Timorese militia to crush dissent, reports of arrest, torture, and murder were numerous.\n\n== Towards independence ==\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the Santa Cruz [[Dili massacre]], November 1998]] \nTimorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against Indonesian forces for the independence of East Timor, during which many atrocities and [[human rights]] violations by the Indonesian army were reported.

In [[Australia]], there was also widespread public outrage, and criticism of Canberra's close relationship with the Suharto regime and recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over East Timor. This caused the Australian government embarrassment, but Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] played down the killings, describing them as \"an aberration, not an act of state policy\". Prime Minister Keating's first overseas trip was to Indonesia in April 1992 and sought to improve trade and cultural relations, but  repression of the East Timorese continued to mar co-operation between the two nations.<ref name=\"primeministers.naa.gov.au\">http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/keating/in-office.aspx</ref>\n\nGareth Evans and Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] (1991\u20131996) gave maintenance of close relations with the Indonesian government a high priority, as did the subsequent Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] during their first term in office (1996\u20131998). Australian governments saw good relations and stability in Indonesia (Australia's largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia's north.<ref name=\"primeministers.naa.gov.au\"/> Nevertheless, Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like [[Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta]] (who based himself in Australia during his exile).\n\nThe fall of President Suharto and the arrival of President [[B. J.

While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics in 1975, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. During the occupation, [[Bishop]] [[Carlos Ximenes Belo]] became one of the most prominent advocates for [[human rights]] in East Timor and many priests and nuns risked their lives in defending citizens from military abuses. [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]]'s 1989 visit to East Timor exposed the occupied territory's situation to world media and provided a catalyst for independence activists to seek global support. Officially neutral, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] wished to retain good relations with the Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation. Upon his arrival in East Timor, the Pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground, alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation, and yet avoiding overtly suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country. He spoke fervently against abuses in his sermon, whilst avoiding naming the Indonesian authorities as responsible.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4410917.stm | work=BBC News | first=Jonathan | last=Head | title=East Timor mourns 'catalyst' Pope | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Bishop [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]] and Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, two leading East Timorese activists for peace and independence, received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for \"their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor\".<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1996/</ref>\n\nA number of priest and nuns were murdered in the violence in East Timor that followed the 1999 Independence referendum.

However, other EU countries like the UK had close economic relations with Indonesia, including arms sales, and saw no advantage in forcefully raising the issue.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the pro-democracy People's Democratic Party (PRD) in Indonesia called for withdrawal from East Timor.

J. Habibie]] was prepared to consider a change of status for East Timor.\nPortugal had started to gain some political allies firstly in the EU, and after that in other places of the world to pressure Indonesia.  In late 1998, the Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] with his Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] drafted a letter setting out a major change in Australian policy. The letter supported the idea of autonomy but went much further by suggesting that the East Timores be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade. The letter upset Habibie, who saw it as implying Indonesia was a \"colonial power\" and he decided in response to announce a snap referendum to be conducted within six months.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nNews of the proposal provoked a violent reaction in East Timor from pro-Indonesian militia. The Indonesian army did not intervene to restore order. At a summit in Bali John Howard told Habibie that a United Nations Peace Keeping force should oversee the process. Habibie rejected the proposal, believing it would have insulted the Indonesian military.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nThe [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|referendum]], held on 30 August, gave a clear majority (78.5%) in favour of independence, rejecting the alternative offer of being an autonomous province within Indonesia, to be known as the Special Autonomous Region of East Timor (SARET).\n\nDirectly after this, Indonesian military-supported [[Pro-Indonesia militia|East Timorese pro-integration militia]] and Indonesian soldiers carried out a campaign of violence and terrorism in retaliation. Approximately 1,400 Timorese were killed and 300,000 forcibly pushed into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed.\n\nActivists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. The violence was met with widespread public anger in Australia. The Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Labor's [[Laurie Brereton]], was vocal in highlighting evidence of the Indonesian military's involvement in pro-integrationist violence and advocated United Nations peacekeeping to support the East Timor's ballot. The [[Catholic Church in Australia]] urged the Australian Government to send an armed peacekeeping force to [[East Timor]] to end the violence.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-23049715.html</ref> Street protesters harried the Indonesian Embassy.\n\n[[File:K-CNRT rally Dili 07'99-25.jpg|thumb|East Timorese independence referendum, 1999]]\nJohn Howard conferred with United Nations Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and lobbied [[U. S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] for an Australian led international peace keeper force to enter East Timor to end the violence. The United States offered crucial logistical and intelligence resources and an \"over-horizon\" deterrent presence.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing.

Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey.

There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691.

Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing.

He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

Blake taught Catherine to write, and she helped him colour his printed poems.<ref>Bentley, G. E, ''Blake Records'', p 341</ref> Gilchrist refers to \"stormy times\" in the early years of the marriage.<ref>Gilchrist, ''Life of William Blake'', 1863, p. 316</ref> Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a [[concubine]] into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian Society]],<ref>Schuchard, MK, ''Why Mrs Blake Cried'', Century, 2006, p. 3</ref> but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture.<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 82</ref>\nIn his Dictionary, Samuel Foster Damon suggests that Catherine may have had a stillborn daughter for which ''The Book of Thel'' is an elegy. That is how he rationalizes the Book's unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.<ref>Damon, Samuel Foster (1988). A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, \"I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel.\"<ref>Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1863, 405</ref>\n\n[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] gives the following account of Blake's death in a letter to [[Samuel Palmer]]:\n\n{{quote|He died ... in a most glorious manner.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\".

''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels.

I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}\n\nIn a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses. My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&lr=&as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.</ref> After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" /> Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eternal Glory.

That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.\nBut the following Contraries to these are True\n:1.

Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

(E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair skinned in India.\n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her own daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part at Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that matches, both being Shanaya. A boy comes for marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya is in need of money for another contest, Miss Punjab.\n\n\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Purnima's step-mother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Bijay Anand as Kartik's father\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet as Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kartik Purnima\n| image                    = \n| genre                    = [[Drama]] ,[[Romance]]\n| channel                  = [[Star Bharat]]\n| creator                  = \n| based_on                 = \n| writer                   = \n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| starring                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| country                  = [[India]]\n| language                 = [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi]]\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 45 (as of 27 March 2020)\n| producer                 = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                  = \n| company                  = \n| distributor              = [[Star India]]\n| picture_format           = \n| first_aired              = {{start date|df=yes|2020|2|03}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website            = https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/kartik-purnima/s-2481\n| production_website = \n}}\n\n'''''Kartik Purnima''''' is an Indian Hindi-language social drama television series, which premiered on 3rd February 2020 on [[Star Bharat]].

Gopalakrishnan).\n\nHe was warned in time by Philomena, who paid a very high price for her honesty, because in reprisals, her family decided to eliminate her.\nIt is at this very moment that Philomena fled, so escaping her murderer and came to take refuge where Ravi was.\n\nTogether, thus, upon their arrival in Madras, they squat successively in an old railway goods wagon, hunted by the railroad authorities, or in an immense ruined and neglected building.\n\nRavi, although awarded a diploma, finds no employment in the big city. He resigns to become a driver of a [[rickshaw]]...\n\nOne day, Philomena comes face to face with Ravi. She finds it degrading that he is reduced to this job, while he possesses all the qualities to obtain a more gratifying job, as high as his ambitions.\n\nIt is then, contrary to all expectations, that a supervisor's post is available in the forest region of Kargudi, but it is subject to a condition: the deposit of a large sum of money (10,000 rupees), and he has only 72 hours. Ravi is distraught.\n\nRavi improvises in being discreetly embedded in a marriage of the neighborhood, for the free food. Accompanied with Philomena, together, they are surprised and thrown out by the guests.\n\nThis sad and distressing experience makes them the terrible precariousness of their situation understood. Philomena, who feels guilty, decides to part from Ravi, during six months, considering herself a burden, the time when he finds a decent job. She promises to return to him after this lapse of time, in the letter which she sent before leaving him.\n\nWhile being at it, Philomena, wanting to save a little girl, is knocked down by the biggest of the fates, by David's vehicle.\n\nWhereas Ravi, aboard a bus, finds an enormous sum of money. After careful consideration, he decides to use the money found to pay the guarantee of his future work.\n\nUpon his arrival, he gets acquainted with a strange character, Manikkum (Delhi Ganesh), who forces him to take the hand of his daughter.\n\nThe man is mentally disturbed since the marriage of his unique daughter, Rukumani (Revathi) (also called Ruku) broke off, for lack of not having been able to honor the dowry, the sum of which it was lost in a bus, recently.\n\nIt turns out that Ruku works for Ravi, as a maid. She turns out to be very naive and very awkward, causing enormous concerns to Ravi, who reprimands her severely every time.\n\nIn the capital, Philomena tells of her setbacks to David. Together, they go to meet Ravi, but on the spot, they realize that the young man is not there anymore.\n\nDavid has to leave to Kargudi for his business and leave only Philomena...\n\nFate wants that Ravi work in David's forest domain. Both men meet and appreciate mutually. David recommends expressly to Ravi to take back Ruku to his service department. Indeed, she was dismissed, some time previously, by Ravi, because of her clumsiness.\n\nShe, who came to give back to Ravi, his wallet lost a little earlier, just catches up. The young woman succumbs to her rescuer.\n\nSekhar, (Chandrasekhar), son of big family, who passed by Kargudi, breaks down with his car. While he looks for some water, he meets Ruku and is in love with her on first sight. He went to the girl's chosen by his parents, whom he gives up definitively. On his return, he quarrels with his father who wants to disinherit him because of the refusal of the arranged marriage, Sekhar outstrips him by abandoning everything, for the beautiful eyes of Ruku and leave his cozy nest.\n\nFollowing a new thoughtlessness of Ruku, Ravi the slap in front of his father, Manikkum. This one, made sick of life, explains to him his failures, in particular, when he lost an enormous sum of money in a bus, among others.\n\nRavi makes the link with the sum which he found formerly, and deducts that he is bound to the misfortunes of Ruku and his father. He regrets bitterly his attitude past with them, in the point to express it to his boss, David. The latter makes it understood to Ravi, that he is not there accidentally and that he could marry Ruku, in repair of damages. But Ravi answers to him that another woman waits for him (by thinking of Philomena, of course!). A little later, Ruku saves in turn Ravi, from an elephant. Chased by wild animal, they take refuge at the top of a watchtower, planned for that purpose, for a whole night. It is in the early hours that the pachyderm goes away.\n\nRegrettably, the wrong languages already make good progress in the village further to this episode, to the point that Ravi has to marry Ruku, avoid him the dishonor, as well as to his poor father, again.\n\nThus the preparations for the marriage are thrown ...\n\nSekhar sends to Rukku the congratulations of circumstances, with a lot of bitterness.\n\nFrom his part, Ravi understands, almost too late, also, that the person that he conversed regularly with by telephone, was none other than Philomena, thanks to words which she, only, usually pronounced: ''... Oru [[Bhagavad Gita]]-laiyo, oru [[Quran]]-laiyo, oru [[Bible]]-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu! ...'' He immediately warns David who quite returned it, upset.\n\nBut Ravi is anxious to marry Ruku, but without the presence of Philomena (who was invited at the request of David, before the rich man knows about all the affair). Regrettably, Ruku who was there, hears everything.\n\nAnd David who had to prevent Philomena from attending the marriage, is already heading for Kargudi, his plane lands in a few hours. In the car which returns her instead of the ceremony, she finds on the seat a file, forgotten the day before, by Ravi. She understands while the bridegroom is other than his Ravi.\n\nTerrified, she asks to the driver to accelerate so that he arrives in time, so that she can prevent Ravi and Ruku's marriage. Once there, it is with surprise that she notices that Ravi waited for her. Indeed, Ruku decided otherwise and decided by mutual agreement, to get married, with the man who left quite behind him, for her, by love, Sekhar. Whereas now married, also, for ever, Ravi and Philomena savour every second of their common existence...\n\n''...

Oru [[Bhagavad Gita]]-laiyo, oru [[Quran]]-laiyo, oru [[Bible]]-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu! ...''\n\nHe warns immediately David who quite returned it, upset.\n\nBut Ravi is always anxious to get married to Ruku, but without the presence of Philomena (who was invited at the request of David, before the rich man knows about all the affair). Regrettably, Ruku who was there, hears everything.\n\nAnd David who had to prevent Philomena from attending the marriage, is already heading for Kargudi, his plane lands in a few hours. In the car which returns her instead of the ceremony, she finds on the seat a file, forgotten the day before, by Ravi. She understands while the bridegroom is other than his Ravi.\n\nTerrified, she asks to the driver to accelerate so that he arrives in time, so that she can prevent this union between Ravi and Ruku. Once there, it is with surprise that she notices that Ravi waited for her.\n\nIndeed, Ruku decided otherwise and decided by mutual agreement, to get married, with the man who left quite behind him, for her, by love, Sekhar.\n\nWhereas now married, also, for ever, Ravi and Philomena savour every second of their common existence...\n\n''... Oru Bhagavad Gita-laiyo, oru Quran-laiyo, oru Bible-laiyo, ippadithan oru sambavam nadakanuna adhu maaththu yaaraalum mudiyathu! ...''\n\n(''...Whether in the Bhagavad Gita, whether in the Quran, whether in the Bible, if a situation of this kind has to take place, nobody can change it !...'')\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]] as Ravi\n*[[Ilavarasi]] as Philomena (also called Philo)\n*[[Revathi]] as Rukumani (also called Ruku)\n*[[Vagai Chandrasekhar]] as Sekhar\n*[[Delhi Ganesh]] as Manikkum, Ruku's father\n*[[V.
