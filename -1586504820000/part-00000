He worked in Cincinnati as a machinist before relocating to New Ulm with other members of the [[Turner Society]]. Upon moving to New Ulm, building on his experience as a machinist, he established a mill. In 1860, August Schell partnered with Jacob Bernhardt to found a brewery to serve the growing German immigrant population in the area. August and Jacob selected a site two miles from the heart of New Ulm along the Cottonwood River. While much of the city of New Ulm was damaged or burned during the [[Dakota War]] of 1865, the brewery escaped intact. In 1866, August Schell bought out his partner Jacob Bernahrdt to take sole ownership of the brewery, starting an unbroken chain of family ownership that continues to this day. During this time, the brewery grew in size and production.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134753/http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |archive-date=2018-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAugust Schell died in 1891 leaving the brewery to his wife Theresa. Their son Otto took over managing the brewery. Otto had studied brewing back in the Schells' home country of Germany. As the 19th century became the 20th, Otto continued to modernize the brewery by adding refrigeration to the brewery. 1911 was a tragic year for the Schell family as first Otto and then Theresa died. At that time, George Marti, the husband of August's daughter Emma, took over managing and operating the brewery.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\n1919 brought about the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and implementation of [[Prohibition]]. The August Schell Brewing Company struggled along with many other American breweries. The brewery transitioned to producing \"near-beer\" (a low alcohol beer still permitted during Prohibition), soft drinks, and candy. Prohibition ended in 1933 with passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. George Marti had successfully steered the brewery through Prohibition, but died shortly thereafter in 1934.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nGeorge's son Alfred (\"Al\") Marti became the President and Manager of the brewery upon the death of his father. Al ran the brewery until 1969 until he retired and passed leadership of the company to his son Warren Marti. During this time, the brewing industry was going through a period of consolidation and upheaval, and Schell's was not immune. At one point, the brewery only managed to keep its doors open by cutting down a large black walnut tree located on the grounds of the brewery and sold its lumber. During Warren's tenure, the brewery responded to its customers changing preferences by introducing Schell's Export Beer, Schell's Light Beer, and 1919 Root Beer (named after the year prohibition was implemented).<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Warren's son Ted Marti took over operations of the brewery and became President of the brewery in 1985. Having studied at the [[Siebels Institute of Brewing]], Ted began expanding the line of beers offered by the Schell's Brewery. One of those beers, Schell's Pilsener, earned a gold medal at the [[Great American Beer Festival]] in 1988. Schell's continued to expand its beer offerings through the 1990s, brewing 38 different beers over that decade.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Schell's Brewery expanded its reach by acquiring the recipe and branding for [[Grain Belt Beer]]. Upon moving production to its New Ulm Brewery, Schell's introduced additional Grain Belt varieties including Grain Belt Nordeast in 2010, Grain Belt Lock & Dam in 2016 (since retired), Grain Belt BLU in 2018 (after appearing at the Minnesota State Fair for several years), and Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza in 2019.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe next generation of the Marti family is increasing its involvement in the management and operation of the brewery. Ted's oldest son Jace Marti became a brewmaster in 2010 and has taken the lead on producing Schell's Noble Star line of sour Berliner Weisse beers. The brewery opened the Starkeller facility on the North side of New Ulm to produce the Noble Star line. This facility also houses a tap room dedicated to these sour ales.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe brewery has continued to update its offerings by retiring long time brews such as Maifest, Schmaltz's Alt, and Pils among others, while adding and IPA, a Kolsch and Cream Ale. In 2020, it is expected that the brewery will release a line of hard seltzers as Grain Belt N'icebreakers as well as a low calorie Grain Belt Elite. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nujournal.com/news/local-news/2020/02/27/schells-releasing-new-products-buying-new-equipment/ |title=Schell's Releasing New Products, Buying New Equipment |publisher=New Ulm Journal |date=2020-02-27 |accessdate=2020-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Brewery ==\nThe historic Schell's brewery is located in New Ulm, Minnesota alongside the Cottonwood River. The brewery has grown and evolved over the decades to accommodate new technology and expanded production lines. In addition to serving as a production facility, the brewery grounds house the historic Schell's mansion, a gift shop, a beer garden, and a deer enclosure. The grounds are open to visitors with tours running out of the gift shop. [[Peafowl]] live on the grounds and are free to roam the property.\n\n== Events ==\nThe August Schell Brewing Company hosts annual Oktoberfest and Bock Fest celebrations on the grounds of the historic Schell's brewery. Oktoberfest, usually held in early October, features a large fest style tent where the Schell's hobo band plays and the Oktoberfest keg is tapped. Bock Fest, held in late February or early March, features a hunt for Bock beers hidden on the grounds of the brewery and nearby Flandrau State Park. Large fire pits are spread throughout the brewery grounds where attendees can have their beers poked with a hot iron. To highlight and celebrate the sour beers produced under its Starkeller label, an annual event called Funk Junction is held at the Starkeller brewery featuring sour and \"funky\" beer from breweries across the United States.\n\n==Contemporary Beer==\n\n===Year-round Brews===\n* '''Original ''(aka Deer Brand)''''', ''ABV 4.8%'', Straw colored classic American lager.

Made with Munich malt and Sterling hops. Debuted in 2020.\n* '''IPA''', ''ABV 5.8%'', An [[india pale ale]] that is hop-forward and bursting with tropical fruity aromas. This brew pours a light golden color and has a low hop bitterness.\n* '''Grain Belt Premium''', ''ABV 4.6%'' Light to medium straw color. Light malt flavor and detectable sweetness. Unique Premium hop aroma and flavor with a low hop bitterness.\n* '''Grain Belt Premium Light''', ''ABV 3.9%'' Light straw color with a slight initial malt flavor.

Smooth taste with excellent drinkability.\n* '''Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza''', ''ABV 4.5%'' A Mexican style lager that is a crisp, copper lager, both dry and refreshing. This easy-drinking lager puts a twist on the friendly beer with its subtle lime flavor.\n\n===Extended Seasonal Brews===\nThese beers are available longer than Schell's other seasonal beers. They are available for roughly six months. \n* '''Fort Road Porter''', ''ABV 4.8%'',  Chocolate and caramel notes shine through this brew, but leaving room for the roasted malts to make their appearance. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the colder months, opposite Fort Road Blonde (formerly ran opposite Fort Road Helles).\n* '''Fort Road Blonde''', Debuting in 2020, this kolsch style ale replaced the Fort Road Helles. With barley grown near the brewery on the historic Fort Road, this beer runs during the warmer months, opposite Fort Road Porter.\n* '''Goosetown''', ''ABV 4.7%'', Schell's interpretation of a German-style [[gose]] spiced with coriander and salt.\n* '''Sangria''', ''ABV 4.7%'', a sweet red citrus [[lager]] full of fruity flavor.\n\n===Seasonal Brews===\n[[Seasonal beer]]s include:\n* '''Bock''', ''ABV 5.8%'', Brewed with a harmonious blend of 10 different types of malt and noble hops, Schell's Bock is fermented slowly, and then lagered for an extended period of time to ensure a smooth finish. This dark amber colored beer sports a robust malt character.\n* '''Hefeweizen''', ''ABV 4.4%'', First brewed in 1984, Schell's Hefeweizen is made with a blend of wheat malt and barley malts. We use an authentic wheat beer yeast culture, which gives the beer a fruity ale character dominated by a citrus-like tartness. Refreshingly light character with a higher than normal carbonation level. Straw-colored and cloudy from the unfiltered yeast left in suspension. Notes of banana and clove with a slight bready malt flavor.\n* '''Grain Belt BLU''', ''ABV 4.6%'', A refreshing twist on a classic; Grain Belt Premium is brewed with a generous portion of blueberries to create a light, balanced, and sweet beer.\n* '''Oktoberfest''', ''ABV 5.5%'', With its bright copper-orange color, it is quite symbolic of the autumnal shift of the season.  A slightly higher strength, and warm malt body make it the perfect companion for the crisp fall weather in Minnesota.  The use of Munich and Vienna malts give the beer its toasty malt backbone, and melanoidin-rich flavor and aroma.  It has a soft malt sweetness, pleasant mouthfeel and a slight spiciness.  Hop character is subdued, as the malt takes center stage with this beer.\n* '''Snowstorm''', ''ABV NA'', Flavor changes yearly, see below for a list of past flavors.\n\n===Minnesota State Fair Brews===\nGrain Belt BLU and Schell's Sangria started as beer available exclusively at the [[Minnesota State Fair]], available with or without a frozen slushie on top. Both beers have since been canned and made available throughout Schell's distribution area. In 2018, Schell's released the Starkeller sour beer Two to Tango, Three to Mango at the Minnesota State Fair where is was exclusively available. This was followed up in 2019 with the Minnesota State Fair exclusive Berry Go Round Sour, available at Lulu's Public House at the State Fair. \n\n===Noble Star Collection===\nA collection of specialty beers, all Berlin-style wheat beers or Berliner Weisse, aged in rare cypress fermentation tanks Schell's bought in 1936.

This beer is rather light on the palate and very dry. A lively carbonation accentuates the refreshingly tart acidity and a full raspberry flavor with a subtle hint of brett character.\n* '''North Country Br\u00fcnette''', ''ABV 5.4%'',  The long, slow, secondary fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture to work on the residual sugars that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile. North Country Br\u00fcnette is very tart and dry, with a fine, rounded acidic profile, and a malty, spiced fruity character. This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.\n* '''Black Forest Cherry''', ''ABV 5.1%'',  The maltiness of Black Forest Cherry provides a platform for the tart red cherries to shine through with a highly acidic and fruity character.

A blend of two different traditional, mixed-culture Berliner Weisse aged for nearly a year in 80 year old cypress wood lagering tanks.

Dusty crimson red in color, a tart cherry aroma emanates from the glass atop an underlying spice. A moderate acidity showcases the cherry tang and almond flavors that mingle together, balancing over a toasty malt backbone, and finishing with a lingering sour, yet sweet, cherry zest.\n* '''Astral Fusion''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Astral Fusion is a mixed-culture Berliner Weisse that was aged for a year in our 80-year-old cypress wood lagering tanks before being transferred onto mangos for an additional three months, and then blended with a portion of raspberry Berliner Weisse before being bottled. The resulting beer is quite tart, bursting with a fruity blend of tropical stone fruit with a hint of raspberries on top of a lemony base acidity.\n* '''Static Transmission''', ''ABV 7%'', Static Transmission pours a hazy gold in color and is bursting with the aromas of fresh wildflowers, lemons and pineapple. Oats lend a rich, creamy mouthfeel over a bright, sweet and sour character. This is the first of the Noble Star line of beers to be released in smaller, 375 ml bottles.\n\n===Grain Belt N'icebreakers===\nUnder its Grain Belt brand, the brewery is releasing hard seltzers in 2020 branded as \"N'icebreakers.\" Samples were served at the 2020 Bockfest celebration, and available flavors include Prickly Pear + Guava.\n\n==Shift Happens Miniseries==\nA \"transitional miniseries in four parts,\" this limited 2020 collection of beers celebrates the 160th anniversary of the brewery.\n* '''Shift Happens No. 1''', ''ABV 9%'', a double dry hopped lager with Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook, and Amarillo hops.

This has evolved to include not beers sold in standalone six packs under the Stag Series label, but also those only available in seasonal variety packs.\n\n===Standalone Stag Series===\n* '''Stag Series #1- Barrel Aged Schmaltz Alt''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Aged in Red Wine Barrels\n*'''Stag Series #2''' '''- Wild Rice Farmhouse Ale'''. The second release in the Stag Series is August Schell's interpretation of a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale. This Farmhouse Ale exhibits an earthy/nutty character due to the generous use of Minnesota Wild Rice, the State Grain of Minnesota. The Wild Rice is combined with 2-Row, Munich, Vienna, and a touch of Rye malt to create a complementary backbone to the unique fermentation characteristics of the yeast.  Dry and thirst quenching, this Farmhouse Ale is hopped with Goldings\n*'''Stag Series #3- Rauchbier'''. A blend of malts smoked over beechwood and cherrywood to create a twist on the traditional style. The remainder of the malt bill includes Dark Munich Malt, Caramunich, and a touch of black malt for color. It is hopped with Tettnang and Sterling.\n*'''Stag Series #4- Burton Ale'''. Schell's Burton Ale is a nod to a forgotten style of beer.  Using traditional floor malted Fawcett Maris Otter as a base, the malt bill also includes torrified wheat and two different British Crystal malts.  As is traditional for British brewers, we added sugar in the kettle, in our case turbinado and some Dark Candi Syrup.  Old Burton Extra is hopped with Nugget and Goldings, fermented with a British ale yeast, dry-hopped, and aged for 3 months prior to release.\n*'''Stag Series #5- Czech Dark Lager'''. Modeled after the famous dark lagers of Bohemia. Dark bread and caramel flavors that are accentuated by a decoction mash, and balanced by the spicy Saaz hops.\n*'''Stag Series #6- Fresh Hop Citra Pils.'''

Collaboration with Gold Ochsen Brauerei in New Ulm's sister city, Ulm Germany. Both cities are also host to fifth generation family-owned breweries and both breweries were founded by men named August. Working in collaboration, we decided to brew a Blonde Doppel Bock. Both breweries uses specialty malts from Weyerman with each brewery using their own base Pilsner malt \u2013 Rahr for Schell's and Schwabenmalz for Gold Ochsen. Both breweries use Emerald, Tattnanger and Saphir hops during the boil and then each brewery uses a different newer German hop variety in the whirlpool and as a dry hop. Schell's uses Polaris hops and Gold Ochsen uses Mandarina Bavaria. Both beer are then fermented with the respective brewries\u2019 house lager yeast and matured for a couple of months before packaging\n*'''Stag Series #9- Cave Aged Barrel Aged Lager'''. A dark lager aged in American whiskey barrels stored in the brewery's original, underground lagering caves. Located below the historic brewery, the naturally cooled caverns were originally constructed in the 1860s to facilitate brewing in an era that predated electrical refrigeration. Dark brown to black in color, the beer has roasted malt notes of dark chocolate, toffee, light oak, char and a hint of vanilla.\n* '''Stag Series #10 Tropical Stout''', ''ABV 8.5%'', Caribbean Style Stout \n* '''Stag Series #11 Bananas Foster Weizenbock''', ''ABV 8.14%'',  A robust wheat ale with light cinnamon flavors layered over hints of banana, clove, and caramel.\n*'''Stag Series #12 1879 Kulmbacher Export''', Based on a recipe dated back in 1879 from upper Franconia, this dark, hoppy lager was a favorite that was often imitated by many breweries. As trends changed, the popularity of this style brew faded quickly and is unfamiliar to today's beer drinkers. Bock-like in strength, it asserts its dark color and pronounced hop bitterness.\n*'''Stag Series #13. It's All Relative''', ''ABV 7.0%'', Franconian Dopple Bock brewed in collaboration with [[Wagner Brauerei]] in Germany, this malty lager has a deep amber color and lightly hopped with a hint of smoke.\n* '''Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged''', ''ABV 10.89%'', Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged lager, a [[Baltic Porter]], is released each fall after spending time aging in the historic caves deep below the brewery.

He worked in Cincinnati as a machinist before relocating to New Ulm with other members of the [[Turner Society]]. Upon moving to New Ulm, building on his experience as a machinist, he established a mill. In 1860, August Schell partnered with Jacob Bernhardt to found a brewery to serve the growing German immigrant population in the area. August and Jacob selected a site two miles from the heart of New Ulm along the Cottonwood River. While much of the city of New Ulm was damaged or burned during the [[Dakota War]] of 1865, the brewery escaped intact. In 1866, August Schell bought out his partner Jacob Bernahrdt to take sole ownership of the brewery, starting an unbroken chain of family ownership that continues to this day. During this time, the brewery grew in size and production.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134753/http://schellsbrewery.com/about-schells/history/ |archive-date=2018-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAugust Schell died in 1891 leaving the brewery to his wife Theresa. Their son Otto took over managing the brewery. Otto had studied brewing back in the Schells' home country of Germany. As the 19th century became the 20th, Otto continued to modernize the brewery by adding refrigeration to the brewery. 1911 was a tragic year for the Schell family as first Otto and then Theresa died. At that time, George Marti, the husband of August's daughter Emma, took over managing and operating the brewery.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\n1919 brought about the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and implementation of [[Prohibition]]. The August Schell Brewing Company struggled along with many other American breweries. The brewery transitioned to producing \"near-beer\" (a low alcohol beer still permitted during Prohibition), soft drinks, and candy. Prohibition ended in 1933 with passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. George Marti had successfully steered the brewery through Prohibition, but died shortly thereafter in 1934.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nGeorge's son Alfred (\"Al\") Marti became the President and Manager of the brewery upon the death of his father. Al ran the brewery until 1969 until he retired and passed leadership of the company to his son Warren Marti. During this time, the brewing industry was going through a period of consolidation and upheaval, and Schell's was not immune. At one point, the brewery only managed to keep its doors open by cutting down a large black walnut tree located on the grounds of the brewery and sold its lumber. During Warren's tenure, the brewery responded to its customers changing preferences by introducing Schell's Export Beer, Schell's Light Beer, and 1919 Root Beer (named after the year prohibition was implemented).<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Warren's son Ted Marti took over operations of the brewery and became President of the brewery in 1985. Having studied at the [[Siebels Institute of Brewing]], Ted began expanding the line of beers offered by the Schell's Brewery. One of those beers, Schell's Pilsener, earned a gold medal at the [[Great American Beer Festival]] in 1988. Schell's continued to expand its beer offerings through the 1990s, brewing 38 different beers over that decade.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Schell's Brewery expanded its reach by acquiring the recipe and branding for [[Grain Belt Beer]]. Upon moving production to its New Ulm Brewery, Schell's introduced additional Grain Belt varieties including Grain Belt Nordeast in 2010, Grain Belt Lock & Dam in 2016 (since retired), Grain Belt BLU in 2018 (after appearing at the Minnesota State Fair for several years), and Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza in 2019.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe next generation of the Marti family is increasing its involvement in the management and operation of the brewery. Ted's oldest son Jace Marti became a brewmaster in 2010 and has taken the lead on producing Schell's Noble Star line of sour Berliner Weisse beers. The brewery opened the Starkeller facility on the North side of New Ulm to produce the Noble Star line. This facility also houses a tap room dedicated to these sour ales.<ref name=\"schellsbrewery.com\"/>\n\nThe brewery has continued to update its offerings by retiring long time brews such as Maifest, Schmaltz's Alt, and Pils among others, while adding and IPA, a Kolsch and Cream Ale. In 2020, it is expected that the brewery will release a line of hard seltzers as Grain Belt N'icebreakers as well as a low calorie Grain Belt Elite. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nujournal.com/news/local-news/2020/02/27/schells-releasing-new-products-buying-new-equipment/ |title=Schell's Releasing New Products, Buying New Equipment |publisher=New Ulm Journal |date=2020-02-27 |accessdate=2020-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Brewery ==\nThe historic Schell's brewery is located in New Ulm, Minnesota alongside the Cottonwood River. The brewery has grown and evolved over the decades to accommodate new technology and expanded production lines. In addition to serving as a production facility, the brewery grounds house the historic Schell's mansion, a gift shop, a beer garden, and a deer enclosure. The grounds are open to visitors with tours running out of the gift shop. [[Peafowl]] live on the grounds and are free to roam the property.\n\n== Events ==\nThe August Schell Brewing Company hosts annual Oktoberfest and Bock Fest celebrations on the grounds of the historic Schell's brewery. Oktoberfest, usually held in early October, features a large fest style tent where the Schell's hobo band plays and the Oktoberfest keg is tapped. Bock Fest, held in late February or early March, features a hunt for Bock beers hidden on the grounds of the brewery and nearby Flandrau State Park. Large fire pits are spread throughout the brewery grounds where attendees can have their beers poked with a hot iron. To highlight and celebrate the sour beers produced under its Starkeller label, an annual event called Funk Junction is held at the Starkeller brewery featuring sour and \"funky\" beer from breweries across the United States.\n\n==Contemporary Beer==\n\n===Year-round Brews===\n* '''Original ''(aka Deer Brand)''''', ''ABV 4.8%'', Straw colored classic American lager.

This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.\n* '''Black Forest Cherry''', ''ABV 5.1%'',  The maltiness of Black Forest Cherry provides a platform for the tart red cherries to shine through with a highly acidic and fruity character.

A moderate acidity showcases the cherry tang and almond flavors that mingle together, balancing over a toasty malt backbone, and finishing with a lingering sour, yet sweet, cherry zest.\n* '''Astral Fusion''', ''ABV 5.4%'', Astral Fusion is a mixed-culture Berliner Weisse that was aged for a year in our 80-year-old cypress wood lagering tanks before being transferred onto mangos for an additional three months, and then blended with a portion of raspberry Berliner Weisse before being bottled. The resulting beer is quite tart, bursting with a fruity blend of tropical stone fruit with a hint of raspberries on top of a lemony base acidity.\n* '''Static Transmission''', ''ABV 7%'', Static Transmission pours a hazy gold in color and is bursting with the aromas of fresh wildflowers, lemons and pineapple.

The second release in the Stag Series is August Schell's interpretation of a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale. This Farmhouse Ale exhibits an earthy/nutty character due to the generous use of Minnesota Wild Rice, the State Grain of Minnesota. The Wild Rice is combined with 2-Row, Munich, Vienna, and a touch of Rye malt to create a complementary backbone to the unique fermentation characteristics of the yeast.  Dry and thirst quenching, this Farmhouse Ale is hopped with Goldings\n*'''Stag Series #3- Rauchbier'''. A blend of malts smoked over beechwood and cherrywood to create a twist on the traditional style. The remainder of the malt bill includes Dark Munich Malt, Caramunich, and a touch of black malt for color. It is hopped with Tettnang and Sterling.\n*'''Stag Series #4- Burton Ale'''. Schell's Burton Ale is a nod to a forgotten style of beer.  Using traditional floor malted Fawcett Maris Otter as a base, the malt bill also includes torrified wheat and two different British Crystal malts.  As is traditional for British brewers, we added sugar in the kettle, in our case turbinado and some Dark Candi Syrup.  Old Burton Extra is hopped with Nugget and Goldings, fermented with a British ale yeast, dry-hopped, and aged for 3 months prior to release.\n*'''Stag Series #5- Czech Dark Lager'''.

Collaboration with Gold Ochsen Brauerei in New Ulm's sister city, Ulm Germany. Both cities are also host to fifth generation family-owned breweries and both breweries were founded by men named August. Working in collaboration, we decided to brew a Blonde Doppel Bock. Both breweries uses specialty malts from Weyerman with each brewery using their own base Pilsner malt \u2013 Rahr for Schell's and Schwabenmalz for Gold Ochsen. Both breweries use Emerald, Tattnanger and Saphir hops during the boil and then each brewery uses a different newer German hop variety in the whirlpool and as a dry hop. Schell's uses Polaris hops and Gold Ochsen uses Mandarina Bavaria. Both beer are then fermented with the respective brewries\u2019 house lager yeast and matured for a couple of months before packaging\n*'''Stag Series #9- Cave Aged Barrel Aged Lager'''. A dark lager aged in American whiskey barrels stored in the brewery's original, underground lagering caves. Located below the historic brewery, the naturally cooled caverns were originally constructed in the 1860s to facilitate brewing in an era that predated electrical refrigeration.

As trends changed, the popularity of this style brew faded quickly and is unfamiliar to today's beer drinkers. Bock-like in strength, it asserts its dark color and pronounced hop bitterness.\n*'''Stag Series #13. It's All Relative''', ''ABV 7.0%'', Franconian Dopple Bock brewed in collaboration with [[Wagner Brauerei]] in Germany, this malty lager has a deep amber color and lightly hopped with a hint of smoke.\n* '''Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged''', ''ABV 10.89%'', Cave-Aged Barrel-Aged lager, a [[Baltic Porter]], is released each fall after spending time aging in the historic caves deep below the brewery.

He led the Qin army to [[Qin's wars of unification#Conquest of Qi|attack the Qi state and conquered it]], after which he was commissioned as an \"Interior Minister\" (\u5167\u53f2). With the fall of Qi, Qin unified all the states in China under its rule. Ying Zheng proclaimed himself \"[[Qin Shi Huang]]\" (First Emperor of Qin) and established the [[Qin dynasty]]. In the following years, Qin Shi Huang put Meng Tian in charge of defending the Qin Empire's northern border from attacks by the [[Xiongnu]] and overseeing the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. Qin Shi Huang trusted the Meng family and regarded them very highly. Meng Yi served in Qin Shi Huang's court as a minister and was one of the emperor's close aides and advisors.

Zhao Gao and Li Si secretly changed the emperor's final edict \u2013 which named his eldest son, [[Fusu]], his successor \u2013 and made Huhai the new emperor instead. The falsified edict also ordered Fusu and Meng Tian, who were away at the border, to commit suicide. Fusu faithfully followed the order but Meng Tian felt suspicious and repeatedly requested for confirmation, but was placed under arrest.

It was one of the first series to appear in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by [[Le Lombard|Les Editions du Lombard]].\n\nThe main protagonists of the adventures are Philip Mortimer, a leading [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist, and his friend Captain Francis Blake of [[MI5]]. The main antagonist is their sworn enemy, Colonel Olrik, who has appeared in almost every book. Their confrontations take them into the realms of [[detective fiction|detective investigation]] and [[science-fiction]], dealing with such themes as time travel, [[Atlantis]] and [[espionage]].\n\nSince the death of Jacobs, new books have been published by two separate teams of artists and writers. A television series based upon the series was produced in 1997, entitled ''[[Blake and Mortimer (TV series)|Blake and Mortimer]]''.\n\nThe books by Jacobs himself are generally set in the very period of their writing, but those authored by others after his death are set mostly in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Jacobs===\nWhen ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine was launched on 26 September 1946, it included the story, ''Le secret de l'Espadon'' (''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'') which introduced the characters of Captain Francis Blake of the British Intelligence Service, his friend Professor Philip Mortimer, a leading physicist, and their sworn enemy Colonel Olrik.<ref name=BDO-t1>{{cite web|last=BDoubli\u00e9es|title=Tintin ann\u00e9e 1946|url=http://bdoubliees.com/tintinbelge/annees/1946.htm|language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe epic of the ''Swordfish'' ended in 1949 but Olrik, Blake and Mortimer continued their conflict through a whole series of science-fiction/detective stories that saw them go all the way from the lost continent of [[Atlantis]] to the [[Catacombs of Paris]].\n\nAfter Jacobs' death in 1987, [[Bob de Moor]] completed his unfinished last story.\n\n===Post-Jacobs===\nFrom 1987, the Jacobs [[Estate (law)|estate]], centred on the still-operating Jacobs Studios, republished all of Jacobs' works.\n\nIn the 1990s, after much debate about story authenticity, [[Dargaud]] got permission to revive the ''Blake and Mortimer'' series, with new stories by a new team of author/draughtsman. The series was still firmly set in the 1950s and included many new regular supporting characters, most notably Blake's colleagues in the security services. Much of series has been created by two separate teams, [[Jean Van Hamme|Van Hamme]]/[[Ted Benoit|Benoit]] and [[Yves Sente|Sente]]/[[Andr\u00e9 Juillard|Juillard]].\n\nThe first book, ''The Francis Blake Affair'', was published in 1996. Famous scenarist [[Jean Van Hamme]] provided the storylines while [[Ligne claire]] specialist draughtsman [[Ted Benoit]] (whose style resembles the later Jacobs's) was contracted for the artwork. Purists immediately objected to the choice of Van Hamme and, upon publication, went on to discover some typical Van Hamme plot twists they disliked.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jacobs' science-fiction was noticeably absent with the story focusing on espionage. However the book became a relative success and the publisher decided to continue the line. In the meantime, however, both Benoit and Van Hamme were tied up on other projects and work on the next book started to lag.\n\nAs an interim solution, writer [[Yves Sente]] and artist [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]] were contracted to publish another adventure, ''The Voronov Plot'' (1998) which took its theme from the [[Cold War]].\n\nFinally, Van Hamme and Benoit managed to finish their album and ''The Strange Encounter'' appeared in 2001, with Blake and Mortimer confronting mysterious alien creatures.\n\nThis was followed by Sente and Juillard's two-book adventure: ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'' (volume 1,''The Universal Threat'' in 2003; volume 2, ''Battle of the Minds'' in 2004) which also dealt with Blake and Mortimer's youth and how they first met in pre-independence [[India]].\n\nIn 2008 Sente and Juillard released another book entitled ''[[The Gondwana Shrine]]'' which chronologically follows the events of ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent''.\n\nThe next adventure in the series, ''[[The Curse of the Thirty Denarii]]'', is divided in two volumes and is written by Jean Van Hamme. The first volume, titled ''Le Manuscript de Nicodemus'' (''The Manuscript of Nicodemus''), was drawn by [[Ren\u00e9 Sterne]], who suddenly died on 15 November 2006, delaying the publication of the book. Sterne's girlfriend [[Chantal De Spiegeleer]] eventually completed his work, which was published on 20 November 2009. [[Aubin Frechon]] drew the second volume of the adventure, which was published 26 November 2010.\n\n==Main characters==\nThe three main characters of the series were already present in slightly different form in the unrelated, first full length [[comic strip]] by Jacobs, ''[[Le Rayon U]]'' (''The U-Ray'', 1943). (In the original Jacobs' version it is not specified that Blake and Mortimer are Welsh and Scottish. They are simply two proud Britons serving HM's Government. The post-Jacobs title ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'' dwells on their early lives, showing how they met in [[colony|colonial]] [[India]].)\n*'''Professor Philip Angus Mortimer''' \u2014 a leading [[physicist]] of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, he grew up in the [[British Raj]] and is the [[archetype|archetypical]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[gentleman]] [[scholarly method|scholar]].

Of the original series there was only one book that did not feature him in one capacity or other: ''[[The Time Trap (comic book)|Le Pi\u00e8ge Diabolique]]'' (''The Time Trap''). Olrik started out in ''The Secret of the Swordfish '' as the head of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for [[Far East|Oriental]] [[dictator]] Basam Damdu. His activities have since ranged from [[mercenary]], [[spy]], [[smuggler]] and general [[crime|criminal]] [[adventurer]]. His nationality, real name, birth places are Unknown. He is believed to be a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]. Olrik's appearance is a self-portrait of Jacobs.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n*'''Lieutenant Ahmed Nasir''' - Nasir Ahmed is the faithful friend and ally of the two main heroes Francis Blake and Philip Mortimer. He appears for the first time in volume one of ''The Secret of the Swordfish'', where he prevents the two men being captured by Olrik in [[Iran]]. He is a sergeant of the 5th Battalion of the \"Makran Levy Corps\" who served under Blake. Following this intervention, Nasir during this adventure helps the two heroes in Egypt, then in London, becoming the butler of Professor Philip Mortimer. Nasir will in fact appear only in the first albums of Jacobs: ''The Secret of the Swordfish'', ''The Mystery of the Great Pyramid'', and ''The Yellow Mark''. His disappearance (which in time corresponds to that of the British Empire) remains unexplained in the later albums by Jacobs. He reappears many years later in ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'', by [[Yves Sente]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]]. We then learn that after leaving the service and Mortimer, he returned to India, where he went into the intelligence service.\n*'''Commissioner Pradier''' is a character created by E.P. Jacobs, whose physique was greatly inspired by the actor [[Jean Gabin]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Divisional Commissioner to the Paris Branch of [[Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire|Territorial Surveillance]] (DST), Pradier helps Blake and Mortimer during their adventures taking place during their stay in France.\n*'''Nastasia Wardynska''' is a female friend and ally of Blake and Mortimer.  She is from Russia. She hasn't appeared in any of Jacobs books, but features several times in subsequent works by other authors.\n*'''Sarah Summertown''' is a novelist-archaeologist, a friend of Blake and Mortimer. It is strongly implied that she and Mortimer were romantically involved during Mortimer's youth.\n*'''Elizabeth McKenzie''' is a student in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], daughter of Sarah Summertown (and, it is slightly implied, Mortimer).\n*'''Admiral Sir William Gray''' is [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|the prime minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[first sea lord]] and chairman of the chiefs of staffs committee. \n*'''Jeronimo Ramirez''' is a [[Mexican-American]] who works for the Los Alamos Nuclear Centre.\n*'''Jessie Wingo''' is a half-[[Cheyenne]] FBI agent.\n*'''Sharkey''' is an American henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Razul''' is a [[Bizenjo]] (known as Bezendjas) henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Jack''' is the glasses-wearing henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Freddy''' is Sharkey's partner-in-crime.\n*'''David Honeychurch''' is deputy chief of MI5 under work for Blake.\n*'''Glenn Kendall''' is Scotland Yard officer.\n*'''Professor Labrousse''' is an ally of Blake and Mortimer and meteorologist from Paris, France.\n*'''Commander William Steele''' is chief of MI6.\n*'''Basam Damdu''' is Olrik's commander-in-chief and the absolute dictator of the [[Yellow Empire]]. A megalomaniac based on [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], obsessed with ruling the world and willing to destroy it rather than lose control of it.\n*'''Mrs. Benson''' is Blake and Mortimer's landlady, a widow of Blake's former CO.\n\n==Story characteristics==\nAlthough the series is (no doubt for reasons of [[euphony]]) called ''Blake and Mortimer'', it is Professor Mortimer who is often the main [[protagonist]]. In the original series, it is mainly he who, through his impulsive character, gets entangled in adventurous circumstances. Blake is the straight man, the serious army officer who comes to the rescue. On the bad-guy side, Colonel Olrik combines characteristics of both heroes.\n\nBlake and Mortimer adventures are characterized by a quest, most often involving adventures underground till the final ending, free and back to the surface. The story structures include some similarities: when the adventure begins certain important but unseen events have already taken place; at the beginning of ''The Yellow Mark'', for instance, the titular character has already made himself known through various activities which the reader only learns about when Mortimer reads a newspaper about these events. Some of the adventures also end with the characters reflecting on what they have learned from their experiences: after his travels through time in ''Time Trap'', Mortimer concludes that rather than dwell on the \"good old days\" or look forward to a \"brighter future\", one should be content with the present.\n\nBlake and Mortimer are sometimes shown to live in the same house, sharing an [[apartment]] in the same manner as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Doctor Watson]]. Many francophone comics have had similar themes of confirmed bachelors living together, including [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]], [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] & [[Obelix]], [[Spirou & Fantasio]], and [[Tif et Tondu|Tif & Tondu]]. These series were all first published during a time when censorship of youth publications was very stringent, and segregation between girls and boys was applied with rigor.\n\nJacobs always drew his stories as being contemporary and based on real environments, so the first few titles have a 1950s look and feel while the last installments are decidedly 1970s. One exception to this rule is, again, ''Time Trap'', which starts in the present (i.e. early 1960s) but whose action, due to a sabotaged malfunctioning [[Time travel|time machine]], largely takes place in the 51st century, and includes a short ventures in [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] and a stopover in the [[Jurassic]] period. Post-Jacobs stories are so far integrated in the chronology of the first ones, therefore taking place in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe art style of E.P. Jacobs, although typical of the Belgian comics drawings (called \"clear line\" or \"[[ligne claire]]\"), is specific in its extensive use of light colors and shots very similar to what can be found in film production. (The panoramic view over London by night opening ''The Yellow Mark'' being a good example.)\n\nThe writing, on the other hand, is noted for its high verbosity (in ''The Yellow \"M\"'', a page has over 900 words), with captions and word balloons frequently stating the action that's also depicted visually.\n\n==List of titles==\n[[File:Blake and m.jpg|thumb|200px|English translation ''The Yellow '\"M\"'']]\n[[File:The Francis Blake Affair.png|200px|thumb|The thirteenth book in the series, ''The Francis Blake Affair'', the first book not to be written by Jacobs.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!#\n!colspan=2|Title\n!Release Date\n!Story\n!Art\n|-\n!1\n|rowspan=3|'''''[[The Secret of the Swordfish|The Secret<br>of the<br>Swordfish]]'''''\n|[[The Secret of the Swordfish#Part 1|'''Volume 1: ''Ruthless Pursuit''''']]\n|1950\n|rowspan=12|[[Edgar P.

Spanish director [[\u00c1lex de la Iglesia]] announced that he was working on an adaptation of the comic to be released around 2010; this project never came to fruition. At one point, it was rumored that [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Kiefer Sutherland]] were to play Blake and Mortimer respectively.<ref>\u00c1lex de la Iglesia is interviewed in \"Noches como \u00e9sta\" {{cite web |url=http://pluton.rtve.es/alex-de-la-iglesia-entrevistado-en-en-noches-como-esta.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013045030/http://pluton.rtve.es/alex-de-la-iglesia-entrevistado-en-en-noches-como-esta.html |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since then, however, nothing has come of this project.\n\n===Games===\nIn 2014, French publisher Ystari Games released the deduction and social table top board game Blake & Mortimer: Witness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164265/witness|title=Witness|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, French publishers [[Dargaud]] and [[Anuman Interactive]] launched the first video game adapted from the Blake and Mortimer series. ''Blake and Mortimer: The Curse of the Thirty Denarii'' is a  [[hidden objects game]] featuring 3D and comic-strip environments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pockett.net/n8962_iPhone_Dargaud_et_Anuman_Interactive_jouent_a_Blake_et_Mortimer_sur_iPhone_et_sur_iPad |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712072340/http://www.pockett.net/n8962_iPhone_Dargaud_et_Anuman_Interactive_jouent_a_Blake_et_Mortimer_sur_iPhone_et_sur_iPad |archivedate=12 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nIn 2005, as part of the [[Brussels' Comic Book Route]], a wall was designed in the Rue du Houblon/Hopstraat in [[Brussels]] which depicts the cover of ''The Yellow \"M\"''. The wall was designed by G. Oreopoulos and D. Vandegeerde.\n\n===Parodies===\n''Blake and Mortimer'' have made cameo appearances in various comic series; particularly those series that are set in the same period of history, the twilight of the [[British Empire]]. The cameos are often a tribute to their creator, [[Edgar P. Jacobs]].\n\nFor example, they make a one-off appearance in the [[Val\u00e9rian and Laureline|Val\u00e9rian]] adventure ''[[On the False Earths]]'' when the hero visits a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London club.\n\nAnother example is the popular Belgian comic series concerning the adventures of [[MI5]] agent [[Clifton (comics)|Colonel Clifton]]. Clifton once featured in a story entitled ''Jade'', published in 2003. In it he meets two characters called Blake and Mortimer, though even as caricatures they bear little resemblance (perhaps deliberately) to Jacob's originals. The story includes elements from the original books, such as the entrance to the secret passage from ''S.O.S. M\u00e9t\u00e9ores'' and the cave that doubles as a [[submarine]] base in ''L'Affaire Francis Blake''.<ref>''Jade'' {{ISBN|2-8036-1669-6}}, by [[Bob de Groot]] (writer) and [[Michel Rodrigue]] (artist), published in 2003</ref>\n\nIn 2005 [[Dargaud]] published a parody entitled ''Menaces sur l'Empire'' (\"The Empire Under Threat\"). This was a humorous presentation of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and was not part of the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] (in fact, the space reserved for the series' title reads \"Les Aventures de Philip et Francis\" as opposed to \"Les Aventures de Blake et Mortimer\"). Jokes included:\n*Mortimer's attempts to break his diet, which his Indian manservant always thwarts, even from a long distance;\n*confusion over whether they are working for [[MI5]] or [[MI6]];\n*the heroes catching [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] in bed with a young woman who is not his wife;\n*a send-up of [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Game of Death]]''.<ref>''Menaces sur l'Empire'' {{ISBN|2-205-05457-0}}, by Pierre Veys (writer) and Nicolas Barral (artist)), published in 2005</ref>\n\n''Tigresse Blanche'' (''White Tigress'') by [[Yann (comics)|Yann]] and [[Conrad (comics)|Conrad]] is another Belgian comic series featuring the adventures of a [[Chinese Communist]] woman spy in post-[[World War II]] [[China]]. It features a British agent, Sir Francis Flake, whose friend (based on Mortimer) gets drunk on the announcement of [[India]]n independence.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde'''s 100 Books of the Century]]\n*[[The Adventures of Tintin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Guyard, Jean-Marc.

Jacobs]]\n}}\n'''''Blake and Mortimer''''' is a [[Belgian comics]] series created by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comic book creator|writer]] and [[comics artist]] [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]. It was one of the first series to appear in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by [[Le Lombard|Les Editions du Lombard]].\n\nThe main protagonists of the adventures are Philip Mortimer, a leading [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist, and his friend Captain Francis Blake of [[MI5]]. The main antagonist is their sworn enemy, Colonel Olrik, who has appeared in almost every book. Their confrontations take them into the realms of [[detective fiction|detective investigation]] and [[science-fiction]], dealing with such themes as time travel, [[Atlantis]] and [[espionage]].\n\nSince the death of Jacobs, new books have been published by two separate teams of artists and writers. A television series based upon the series was produced in 1997, entitled ''[[Blake and Mortimer (TV series)|Blake and Mortimer]]''.\n\nThe books by Jacobs himself are generally set in the very period of their writing, but those authored by others after his death are set mostly in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Jacobs===\nWhen ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine was launched on 26 September 1946, it included the story, ''Le secret de l'Espadon'' (''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'') which introduced the characters of Captain Francis Blake of the British Intelligence Service, his friend Professor Philip Mortimer, a leading physicist, and their sworn enemy Colonel Olrik.<ref name=BDO-t1>{{cite web|last=BDoubli\u00e9es|title=Tintin ann\u00e9e 1946|url=http://bdoubliees.com/tintinbelge/annees/1946.htm|language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe epic of the ''Swordfish'' ended in 1949 but Olrik, Blake and Mortimer continued their conflict through a whole series of science-fiction/detective stories that saw them go all the way from the lost continent of [[Atlantis]] to the [[Catacombs of Paris]].\n\nAfter Jacobs' death in 1987, [[Bob de Moor]] completed his unfinished last story.\n\n===Post-Jacobs===\nFrom 1987, the Jacobs [[Estate (law)|estate]], centred on the still-operating Jacobs Studios, republished all of Jacobs' works.\n\nIn the 1990s, after much debate about story authenticity, [[Dargaud]] got permission to revive the ''Blake and Mortimer'' series, with new stories by a new team of author/draughtsman. The series was still firmly set in the 1950s and included many new regular supporting characters, most notably Blake's colleagues in the security services. Much of series has been created by two separate teams, [[Jean Van Hamme|Van Hamme]]/[[Ted Benoit|Benoit]] and [[Yves Sente|Sente]]/[[Andr\u00e9 Juillard|Juillard]].\n\nThe first book, ''The Francis Blake Affair'', was published in 1996. Famous scenarist [[Jean Van Hamme]] provided the storylines while [[Ligne claire]] specialist draughtsman [[Ted Benoit]] (whose style resembles the later Jacobs's) was contracted for the artwork. Purists immediately objected to the choice of Van Hamme and, upon publication, went on to discover some typical Van Hamme plot twists they disliked.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jacobs' science-fiction was noticeably absent with the story focusing on espionage. However the book became a relative success and the publisher decided to continue the line. In the meantime, however, both Benoit and Van Hamme were tied up on other projects and work on the next book started to lag.\n\nAs an interim solution, writer [[Yves Sente]] and artist [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]] were contracted to publish another adventure, ''The Voronov Plot'' (1998) which took its theme from the [[Cold War]].\n\nFinally, Van Hamme and Benoit managed to finish their album and ''The Strange Encounter'' appeared in 2001, with Blake and Mortimer confronting mysterious alien creatures.\n\nThis was followed by Sente and Juillard's two-book adventure: ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'' (volume 1,''The Universal Threat'' in 2003; volume 2, ''Battle of the Minds'' in 2004) which also dealt with Blake and Mortimer's youth and how they first met in pre-independence [[India]].\n\nIn 2008 Sente and Juillard released another book entitled ''[[The Gondwana Shrine]]'' which chronologically follows the events of ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent''.\n\nThe next adventure in the series, ''[[The Curse of the Thirty Denarii]]'', is divided in two volumes and is written by Jean Van Hamme. The first volume, titled ''Le Manuscript de Nicodemus'' (''The Manuscript of Nicodemus''), was drawn by [[Ren\u00e9 Sterne]], who suddenly died on 15 November 2006, delaying the publication of the book. Sterne's girlfriend [[Chantal De Spiegeleer]] eventually completed his work, which was published on 20 November 2009. [[Aubin Frechon]] drew the second volume of the adventure, which was published 26 November 2010.\n\n==Main characters==\nThe three main characters of the series were already present in slightly different form in the unrelated, first full length [[comic strip]] by Jacobs, ''[[Le Rayon U]]'' (''The U-Ray'', 1943). (In the original Jacobs' version it is not specified that Blake and Mortimer are Welsh and Scottish. They are simply two proud Britons serving HM's Government. The post-Jacobs title ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'' dwells on their early lives, showing how they met in [[colony|colonial]] [[India]].)\n*'''Professor Philip Angus Mortimer''' \u2014 a leading [[physicist]] of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, he grew up in the [[British Raj]] and is the [[archetype|archetypical]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[gentleman]] [[scholarly method|scholar]]. Mortimer was based upon a friend and sometime collaborator of Jacobs, [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} There was one imaginative addition by Jacobs, since Van Melkebeke had no beard.\n*'''Captain Francis Percy Blake''' \u2014 [[Wales|Welsh]]-born [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty]]'s [[army|armed forces]].

He is a master of disguise, even fooling Mortimer on occasion. Blake was modeled on another friend and sometimes collaborator of Jacobs, [[Jacques Laudy]], with added mustache.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaudez|first=Florent|title=Les arts moyens aujourd'hui: actes du colloque international d'Albi, 30-31 mars, 1er avril 2006, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=Editions L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2-296-05870-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YorGsNMDkTYC&pg=PA218&dq=%22Jacques+Laudy%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Laudy%22&f=false|accessdate=23 June 2010|page=218|language=French}}</ref>\n[[File:Colonel Olrik (Blake and Mortimer).png|thumb|right|120px|'''Colonel Olrik''']]\n*'''Colonel Olrik''' \u2014 the perennial [[villain]] from the first installment onwards. Of the original series there was only one book that did not feature him in one capacity or other: ''[[The Time Trap (comic book)|Le Pi\u00e8ge Diabolique]]'' (''The Time Trap''). Olrik started out in ''The Secret of the Swordfish '' as the head of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for [[Far East|Oriental]] [[dictator]] Basam Damdu. His activities have since ranged from [[mercenary]], [[spy]], [[smuggler]] and general [[crime|criminal]] [[adventurer]]. His nationality, real name, birth places are Unknown. He is believed to be a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]. Olrik's appearance is a self-portrait of Jacobs.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n*'''Lieutenant Ahmed Nasir''' - Nasir Ahmed is the faithful friend and ally of the two main heroes Francis Blake and Philip Mortimer. He appears for the first time in volume one of ''The Secret of the Swordfish'', where he prevents the two men being captured by Olrik in [[Iran]]. He is a sergeant of the 5th Battalion of the \"Makran Levy Corps\" who served under Blake. Following this intervention, Nasir during this adventure helps the two heroes in Egypt, then in London, becoming the butler of Professor Philip Mortimer. Nasir will in fact appear only in the first albums of Jacobs: ''The Secret of the Swordfish'', ''The Mystery of the Great Pyramid'', and ''The Yellow Mark''. His disappearance (which in time corresponds to that of the British Empire) remains unexplained in the later albums by Jacobs. He reappears many years later in ''The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent'', by [[Yves Sente]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]]. We then learn that after leaving the service and Mortimer, he returned to India, where he went into the intelligence service.\n*'''Commissioner Pradier''' is a character created by E.P.

She is from Russia. She hasn't appeared in any of Jacobs books, but features several times in subsequent works by other authors.\n*'''Sarah Summertown''' is a novelist-archaeologist, a friend of Blake and Mortimer. It is strongly implied that she and Mortimer were romantically involved during Mortimer's youth.\n*'''Elizabeth McKenzie''' is a student in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], daughter of Sarah Summertown (and, it is slightly implied, Mortimer).\n*'''Admiral Sir William Gray''' is [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|the prime minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[first sea lord]] and chairman of the chiefs of staffs committee. \n*'''Jeronimo Ramirez''' is a [[Mexican-American]] who works for the Los Alamos Nuclear Centre.\n*'''Jessie Wingo''' is a half-[[Cheyenne]] FBI agent.\n*'''Sharkey''' is an American henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Razul''' is a [[Bizenjo]] (known as Bezendjas) henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Jack''' is the glasses-wearing henchman of Olrik.\n*'''Freddy''' is Sharkey's partner-in-crime.\n*'''David Honeychurch''' is deputy chief of MI5 under work for Blake.\n*'''Glenn Kendall''' is Scotland Yard officer.\n*'''Professor Labrousse''' is an ally of Blake and Mortimer and meteorologist from Paris, France.\n*'''Commander William Steele''' is chief of MI6.\n*'''Basam Damdu''' is Olrik's commander-in-chief and the absolute dictator of the [[Yellow Empire]]. A megalomaniac based on [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], obsessed with ruling the world and willing to destroy it rather than lose control of it.\n*'''Mrs. Benson''' is Blake and Mortimer's landlady, a widow of Blake's former CO.\n\n==Story characteristics==\nAlthough the series is (no doubt for reasons of [[euphony]]) called ''Blake and Mortimer'', it is Professor Mortimer who is often the main [[protagonist]]. In the original series, it is mainly he who, through his impulsive character, gets entangled in adventurous circumstances. Blake is the straight man, the serious army officer who comes to the rescue. On the bad-guy side, Colonel Olrik combines characteristics of both heroes.\n\nBlake and Mortimer adventures are characterized by a quest, most often involving adventures underground till the final ending, free and back to the surface. The story structures include some similarities: when the adventure begins certain important but unseen events have already taken place; at the beginning of ''The Yellow Mark'', for instance, the titular character has already made himself known through various activities which the reader only learns about when Mortimer reads a newspaper about these events. Some of the adventures also end with the characters reflecting on what they have learned from their experiences: after his travels through time in ''Time Trap'', Mortimer concludes that rather than dwell on the \"good old days\" or look forward to a \"brighter future\", one should be content with the present.\n\nBlake and Mortimer are sometimes shown to live in the same house, sharing an [[apartment]] in the same manner as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Doctor Watson]]. Many francophone comics have had similar themes of confirmed bachelors living together, including [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]], [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] & [[Obelix]], [[Spirou & Fantasio]], and [[Tif et Tondu|Tif & Tondu]]. These series were all first published during a time when censorship of youth publications was very stringent, and segregation between girls and boys was applied with rigor.\n\nJacobs always drew his stories as being contemporary and based on real environments, so the first few titles have a 1950s look and feel while the last installments are decidedly 1970s. One exception to this rule is, again, ''Time Trap'', which starts in the present (i.e. early 1960s) but whose action, due to a sabotaged malfunctioning [[Time travel|time machine]], largely takes place in the 51st century, and includes a short ventures in [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] and a stopover in the [[Jurassic]] period. Post-Jacobs stories are so far integrated in the chronology of the first ones, therefore taking place in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe art style of E.P. Jacobs, although typical of the Belgian comics drawings (called \"clear line\" or \"[[ligne claire]]\"), is specific in its extensive use of light colors and shots very similar to what can be found in film production.

[[Cinebook Ltd]] has been published the entire series, including new albums as they come out.\n\nThe Blake and Mortimer Editions published English translations of all three parts of ''The Secret of the Swordfish'' in 1986, both parts of ''The Mystery of the Great Pyramid'' in 1987 and ''The Yellow \"M\"'' in 1988.\n\n[[Catalan Communications]], under its 'Comcat' line of books, published two books in inexpensive trade paperback copies in the US. They released:\n#''The Time Trap'' (''Le Pi\u00e8ge diabolique'') (1989)\n#''Atlantis Mystery'' (''L'\u00c9nigme de l'Atlantide'') (1990)\n\nThere were also plans to release ''Secret of the Great Pyramid'' in 2 volumes, and then ''The Yellow Mark'', but the company went under before they could get a chance to realize them.\n\n[[Cinebook Ltd]] have been publishing English language translations of ''Blake and Mortimer'' since 2007.

Spanish director [[\u00c1lex de la Iglesia]] announced that he was working on an adaptation of the comic to be released around 2010; this project never came to fruition. At one point, it was rumored that [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Kiefer Sutherland]] were to play Blake and Mortimer respectively.<ref>\u00c1lex de la Iglesia is interviewed in \"Noches como \u00e9sta\" {{cite web |url=http://pluton.rtve.es/alex-de-la-iglesia-entrevistado-en-en-noches-como-esta.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013045030/http://pluton.rtve.es/alex-de-la-iglesia-entrevistado-en-en-noches-como-esta.html |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since then, however, nothing has come of this project.\n\n===Games===\nIn 2014, French publisher Ystari Games released the deduction and social table top board game Blake & Mortimer: Witness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164265/witness|title=Witness|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, French publishers [[Dargaud]] and [[Anuman Interactive]] launched the first video game adapted from the Blake and Mortimer series. ''Blake and Mortimer: The Curse of the Thirty Denarii'' is a  [[hidden objects game]] featuring 3D and comic-strip environments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pockett.net/n8962_iPhone_Dargaud_et_Anuman_Interactive_jouent_a_Blake_et_Mortimer_sur_iPhone_et_sur_iPad |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712072340/http://www.pockett.net/n8962_iPhone_Dargaud_et_Anuman_Interactive_jouent_a_Blake_et_Mortimer_sur_iPhone_et_sur_iPad |archivedate=12 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nIn 2005, as part of the [[Brussels' Comic Book Route]], a wall was designed in the Rue du Houblon/Hopstraat in [[Brussels]] which depicts the cover of ''The Yellow \"M\"''. The wall was designed by G. Oreopoulos and D. Vandegeerde.\n\n===Parodies===\n''Blake and Mortimer'' have made cameo appearances in various comic series; particularly those series that are set in the same period of history, the twilight of the [[British Empire]]. The cameos are often a tribute to their creator, [[Edgar P. Jacobs]].\n\nFor example, they make a one-off appearance in the [[Val\u00e9rian and Laureline|Val\u00e9rian]] adventure ''[[On the False Earths]]'' when the hero visits a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London club.\n\nAnother example is the popular Belgian comic series concerning the adventures of [[MI5]] agent [[Clifton (comics)|Colonel Clifton]]. Clifton once featured in a story entitled ''Jade'', published in 2003. In it he meets two characters called Blake and Mortimer, though even as caricatures they bear little resemblance (perhaps deliberately) to Jacob's originals. The story includes elements from the original books, such as the entrance to the secret passage from ''S.O.S. M\u00e9t\u00e9ores'' and the cave that doubles as a [[submarine]] base in ''L'Affaire Francis Blake''.<ref>''Jade'' {{ISBN|2-8036-1669-6}}, by [[Bob de Groot]] (writer) and [[Michel Rodrigue]] (artist), published in 2003</ref>\n\nIn 2005 [[Dargaud]] published a parody entitled ''Menaces sur l'Empire'' (\"The Empire Under Threat\"). This was a humorous presentation of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and was not part of the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] (in fact, the space reserved for the series' title reads \"Les Aventures de Philip et Francis\" as opposed to \"Les Aventures de Blake et Mortimer\"). Jokes included:\n*Mortimer's attempts to break his diet, which his Indian manservant always thwarts, even from a long distance;\n*confusion over whether they are working for [[MI5]] or [[MI6]];\n*the heroes catching [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] in bed with a young woman who is not his wife;\n*a send-up of [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Game of Death]]''.<ref>''Menaces sur l'Empire'' {{ISBN|2-205-05457-0}}, by Pierre Veys (writer) and Nicolas Barral (artist)), published in 2005</ref>\n\n''Tigresse Blanche'' (''White Tigress'') by [[Yann (comics)|Yann]] and [[Conrad (comics)|Conrad]] is another Belgian comic series featuring the adventures of a [[Chinese Communist]] woman spy in post-[[World War II]] [[China]]. It features a British agent, Sir Francis Flake, whose friend (based on Mortimer) gets drunk on the announcement of [[India]]n independence.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde'''s 100 Books of the Century]]\n*[[The Adventures of Tintin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Guyard, Jean-Marc.

Although not a first line choice for either hypertension or prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for patients who present with both problems concomitantly.<ref name=pharmnemonics />\n\nThere is some evidence that this medication is effective in treating nightmares, based on mixed results in randomized controlled trials.
