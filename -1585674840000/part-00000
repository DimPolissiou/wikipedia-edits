This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system.  The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.  By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.\n\nOn 1 February, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] instructed the municipal and prefectural governments to establish specialized COVID-19 consultation centres and outpatient wards at their local public health facilities by the first half of the month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20200203/k00/00m/040/227000c|title=\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u300c\u5e30\u56fd\u8005\u30fb\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u76f8\u8ac7\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3078 \u5c02\u9580\u5916\u6765\u3078\u306e\u53d7\u8a3a\u3092\u4fc3\u3059|last=|first=|date=2020-02-03|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Mainichi)|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>  Such wards would provide medical examinations and testing for suspected carriers of the disease to protect general hospitals from infection.\n\nOn 5 February, PM Abe announced during the Fifth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would begin preparations to strengthen COVID-19 testing capabilities at the NIID and 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that are designated by the government as official testing sites.  Without any uniform diagnosis kit for the disease, the government has relied on [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests to check for infections.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.

The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.

After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

It is located at 420\u2013430 [[Lexington Avenue]] between 43rd and 44th Streets, adjacent to [[Grand Central Terminal]].\n\nThe Graybar Building was designed by Sloan & Robertson in the [[Art Deco]] style. The building was erected within \"[[Terminal City (Grand Central Terminal)|Terminal City]]\", a collection of buildings located above Grand Central's underground tracks, and as such, occupies the real-estate [[air rights]] above these tracks. The Graybar Building's ground floor includes the \"Graybar Passage\", a publicly accessible passageway that leads from Lexington Avenue to Grand Central Terminal.\n\nWhen the building's construction started in 1925, it was known as the '''Eastern Terminal Office Building'''. The structure was renamed after [[Graybar]], one of its original lessees, the next year. The Graybar Building opened in April 1927 and was fully leased within less than a year. Ownership of the building passed several times before the current owners, [[SL Green Realty]], bought it in 1998. The [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated the Graybar Building as an official landmark in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n=== Site ===\nIn 1871, the [[New York Central Railroad]] built the [[Grand Central Depot]], a ground-level depot at the intersection of [[Park Avenue]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], which would be succeeded in 1900 by [[Grand Central Station (1900\u20131910)|Grand Central Station]], also located at ground level.<ref name=\"AutoDR-29\">{{cite aia5|page=313}}</ref> The Graybar Building's site, located just east of the depot and station, was partly occupied by the original [[Grand Central Palace]], which was built {{Circa|1893}}<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2016|ps=.|p=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/02/27/archives/a-great-new-building-ii-will-become-famous-as-the-grand-central.html|title=A Great New Building; It Will Become Famous as the Grand Central Palace|date=February 27, 1893|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 16, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and later used as a hotel.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1904/12/17/archives/new-york-central-adds-two-blocks-to-terminal-the-grand-central.html|title=New York Central Adds Two Blocks To Terminal; The Grand Central Palace Included in Its Purchase.|date=December 17, 1904|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 16, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The site also contained a small ground-floor post office.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/03/08/archives/in-and-about-the-city-as-uptown-post-office-it-will-be-established.html|title=In and About the City; as up-Town Post Office.

It is located at 420-430 [[Lexington Avenue]] between 43rd and 44th Streets, adjacent to [[Grand Central Terminal]].\n\nThe Graybar Building was designed by Sloan & Robertson in the [[Art Deco]] style. The building was erected within \"[[Terminal City (Grand Central Terminal)|Terminal City]]\", a collection of buildings located above Grand Central's underground tracks, and as such, occupies the real-estate [[air rights]] above these tracks. The Graybar Building's ground floor includes the \"Graybar Passage\", a publicly accessible passageway that leads from Lexington Avenue to Grand Central Terminal.\n\nWhen the building's construction started in 1925, it was known as the '''Eastern Terminal Office Building'''. The structure was renamed after [[Graybar]], one of its original lessees, the next year. The Graybar Building opened in April 1927 and was fully leased within less than a year. Ownership of the building passed several times before the current owners, [[SL Green Realty]], bought it in 1998. The [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated the Graybar Building as an official landmark in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n=== Site ===\nIn 1871, the [[New York Central Railroad]] built the [[Grand Central Depot]], a ground-level depot at the intersection of [[Park Avenue]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], which would be succeeded in 1900 by [[Grand Central Station (1900\u20131910)|Grand Central Station]], also located at ground level.<ref name=\"AutoDR-29\">{{cite aia5|page=313}}</ref> The Graybar Building's site, located just east of the depot and station, was partly occupied by the original [[Grand Central Palace]], which was built {{Circa|1893}}<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2016|ps=.|p=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/02/27/archives/a-great-new-building-ii-will-become-famous-as-the-grand-central.html|title=A Great New Building; It Will Become Famous as the Grand Central Palace|date=February 27, 1893|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 16, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and later used as a hotel.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1904/12/17/archives/new-york-central-adds-two-blocks-to-terminal-the-grand-central.html|title=New York Central Adds Two Blocks To Terminal; The Grand Central Palace Included in Its Purchase.|date=December 17, 1904|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 16, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The site also contained a small ground-floor post office.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/03/08/archives/in-and-about-the-city-as-uptown-post-office-it-will-be-established.html|title=In and About the City; as up-Town Post Office.

The film was produced by [[David O. Selznick]] of [[Selznick International Pictures]] and directed by [[Victor Fleming]]. Set in the [[American South]] against the backdrop of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]], the film tells the story of [[Scarlett O'Hara]], the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner. It follows her romantic pursuit of [[Ashley Wilkes]], who is married to his cousin, [[Melanie Hamilton]], and her subsequent marriage to [[Rhett Butler]]. The leading roles are played by [[Vivien Leigh]] (Scarlett), [[Clark Gable]] (Rhett), [[Leslie Howard]] (Ashley), and [[Olivia de Havilland]] (Melanie).\n\nProduction was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler, and the \"search for Scarlett\" led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part. The original screenplay was written by [[Sidney Howard]] and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. The original director, [[George Cukor]], was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by [[Sam Wood]] while Fleming took some time off due to [[exhaustion]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised, and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett. At the [[12th Academy Awards]], it received ten [[Academy Awards]] (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Fleming), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Leigh), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Hattie McDaniel]], becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\n\n''Gone with the Wind'' was immensely popular when first released. It became the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-earning film made up to that point]], and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|adjusted for monetary inflation]], it is still [[List of highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|the highest-grossing film in history]]. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]]; it has placed in the top ten of the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|top 100 American films]] since the list's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|inception in 1998]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Gone With the Wind Poster 1939.jpg|thumb|Scarlett and Rhett at the charity dance]]\nIn 1861, on the eve of the [[American Civil War]], [[Scarlett O'Hara]] lives at [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], her family's [[cotton plantation]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that [[Ashley Wilkes]], whom she secretly loves, is to be [[Cousin marriage|married to his cousin]], [[Melanie Hamilton]], and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation [[Twelve Oaks]]. At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley, but instead catches the attention of another guest, [[Rhett Butler]]. The barbecue is disrupted by news of the declaration of war, and the men rush to enlist. In a bid to arouse jealousy in Ashley, Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother Charles before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the [[Confederate Army]], Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in [[Atlanta]], where she creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in her mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a [[blockade runner]] for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the [[Union Army]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Once out of the city, Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of [[typhoid fever]] and her father has become senile. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.\n\nAs the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a [[scalawag]] from his land, but is thrown from his horse and killed. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstructionist's]] taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy [[general store]] owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor. Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a [[shanty town]] after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts.\n\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed. One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\n\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a [[miscarriage]]. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes again when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was him she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett [[Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn|rebuffs her]] and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase. \n\nA distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, believing that one day she will get Rhett back.\n\n==Cast==\nDespite receiving top-[[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]] in the [[opening credits]], Gable\u2014along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive second, third, and fourth billing respectively\u2014has a relatively low placing in the [[cast list]], due to its unusual structure. Rather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into three sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list as the head of the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit and Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the most screen time. Similarly, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over Leslie Howard who plays his son, and Clark Gable, who plays only a visitor at Twelve Oaks, receives a relatively low credit in the cast list, despite being presented as the \"[[Movie star|star]]\" of the film in all the promotional literature.<ref name=\"AFIcatalog\">{{cite web |title=Gone With the Wind |work=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/1181 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Following the death of Mary Anderson\u2014who played Maybelle Merriwether\u2014in April 2014, there are only two surviving credited cast members from the film: Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes; and Mickey Kuhn, who played her son, Beau.<ref>{{cite news |first=Claire |last=Noland |title=Mary Anderson Dies at 96; Actress had Role in 'Gone With the Wind' |date=April 8, 2014 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mary-anderson-20140408-story.html |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col}}\n;Tara plantation\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Gerald O'Hara\n* [[Barbara O'Neil]] as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n* [[Vivien Leigh]] as [[Scarlett O'Hara]] (daughter)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[George Reeves]] as Brent Tarleton (actually as Stuart){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton|The credits at the start of the film contain an error: George Reeves is listed \"as Brent Tarleton\", but plays Stuart, while Fred Crane is listed \"as Stuart Tarleton\", but plays Brent.<ref name=AFIcatalog/>}}\n* [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] as Stuart Tarleton (actually as Brent){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton}}\n* [[Hattie McDaniel]] as Mammy (house servant)\n* [[Oscar Polk]] as Pork (house servant)\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Prissy (house servant)\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as Big Sam (field foreman)\n;At Twelve Oaks\n* [[Howard Hickman]] as John Wilkes\n* [[Alicia Rhett]] as [[India Wilkes]] (his daughter)\n* [[Leslie Howard]] as [[Ashley Wilkes]] (his son)\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Melanie Hamilton]] (their cousin)\n* [[Rand Brooks]] as [[Gone with the Wind (novel)#Other characters|Charles Hamilton]] (Melanie's brother)\n* [[Carroll Nye]] as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Rhett Butler]] (a visitor from Charleston)\n;In Atlanta\n* [[Laura Hope Crews]] as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n* [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]] as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Dr. Meade\n* [[Leona Roberts]] as Mrs. Meade\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as Mrs. Merriwether\n* [[Ona Munson]] as Belle Watling\n;Minor supporting roles\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as the Yankee deserter\n* [[Cammie King|Cammie King Conlon]] as Bonnie Blue Butler\n* [[J.

Warner Bros.\u2014who had contracted Steiner in 1936\u2014agreed to lend him to Selznick. Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired, including [[Hugo Friedhofer]], Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, [[Adolph Deutsch]] and Reginald Bassett.\n\nThe score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included [[Stephen Foster]] tunes such as \"Louisiana Belle\", \"Dolly Day\", \"Ringo De Banjo\", \"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\", \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", and \"Katie Belle\", which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: \"Marching through Georgia\" by [[Henry Clay Work]], \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\", \"[[Garryowen (air)|Garryowen]]\", and \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]\". The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical basis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by [[Mack David]]. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score.\n\nDue to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and [[Heinz Roemheld]], and in addition, two short cues\u2014by [[Franz Waxman]] and [[William Axt]]\u2014were taken from scores in the MGM library.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurence E. |last=MacDonald |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History |year=1998 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1-880157-56-5 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT68 52]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT69 53]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Preview, premiere and initial release===\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]], investor [[Jock Whitney|John \"Jock\" Whitney]], and film editor Hal Kern drove out to [[Riverside, California]] to preview the film at the [[Riverside Fox Theater|Fox Theatre]].

he hopes \"never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs\".<ref name=\"Schickel\" /><ref name=\"Kauffmann\" /> Both Schickel and [[Andrew Sarris]] identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\", but rather having emerged \"steaming from the crowded kitchen\", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.<ref

sentimentality.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\" /> Kauffmann also finds interesting parallels with ''The Godfather'', which had just replaced ''Gone with the Wind'' as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from \"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are romanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or revisionism.<ref name=\"Kauffmann\"

Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, ''Gone with the Wind'' nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering [[freedman]]: a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The inference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials.\n\nWhile perpetuating some [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] myths, the film makes concessions in regard to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler, and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by referring to it only as a \"political meeting\".<ref name=\"Ruiz\">{{cite book |first=W.

More than any film since ''The Birth of a Nation'', it unleashed a variety of social forces that foreshadowed an alliance of white liberals and blacks who encouraged the expectation that blacks would one day achieve equality.

Mitchell continued to resist pressure from Selznick and MGM to write a sequel until her death in 1949. In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and [[Universal Studios]] on a budget of $12&nbsp;million. [[Anne Edwards]] was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards submitted a 775-page manuscript entitled ''Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind'', set between 1872 and 1882 focusing on Scarlett's divorce from Rhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.<ref name=\"Bartel\" />\n\nThe idea was revived in the 1990s, when a sequel was finally produced in 1994, in the form of a television [[miniseries]].

The film was produced by [[David O. Selznick]] of [[Selznick International Pictures]] and directed by [[Victor Fleming]]. Set in the [[American South]] against the backdrop of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]], the film tells the story of [[Scarlett O'Hara]], the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner. It follows her romantic pursuit of [[Ashley Wilkes]], who is married to his cousin, [[Melanie Hamilton]], and her subsequent marriage to [[Rhett Butler]]. The leading roles are played by [[Vivien Leigh]] (Scarlett), [[Clark Gable]] (Rhett), [[Leslie Howard]] (Ashley), and [[Olivia de Havilland]] (Melanie).\n\nProduction was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler, and the \"search for Scarlett\" led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part. The original screenplay was written by [[Sidney Howard]] and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. The original director, [[George Cukor]], was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by [[Sam Wood]] while Fleming took some time off due to [[exhaustion]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised, and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett. At the [[12th Academy Awards]], it received ten [[Academy Awards]] (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Fleming), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Leigh), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Hattie McDaniel]], becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\n\n''Gone with the Wind'' was immensely popular when first released. It became the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-earning film made up to that point]], and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|adjusted for monetary inflation]], it is still [[List of highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|the highest-grossing film in history]]. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]]; it has placed in the top ten of the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|top 100 American films]] since the list's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|inception in 1998]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Gone With the Wind Poster 1939.jpg|thumb|Scarlett and Rhett at the charity dance]]\nIn 1861, on the eve of the [[American Civil War]], [[Scarlett O'Hara]] lives at [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], her family's [[cotton plantation]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that [[Ashley Wilkes]], whom she secretly loves, is to be [[Cousin marriage|married to his cousin]], [[Melanie Hamilton]], and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation [[Twelve Oaks]]. At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley, but instead catches the attention of another guest, [[Rhett Butler]]. The barbecue is disrupted by news of the declaration of war, and the men rush to enlist. In a bid to arouse jealousy in Ashley, Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother Charles before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the [[Confederate Army]], Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in [[Atlanta]], where she creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in her mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a [[blockade runner]] for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the [[Union Army]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Once out of the city, Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of [[typhoid fever]] and her father has become senile. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.\n\nAs the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a [[scalawag]] from his land, but is thrown from his horse and killed. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstructionists']] taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy [[general store]] owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor. Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a [[shanty town]] after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts.\n\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed. One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\n\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a [[miscarriage]]. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was him she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase. A distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, believing that one day she will get Rhett back.\n\n==Cast==\nDespite receiving top-[[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]] in the [[opening credits]], Gable\u2014along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive second, third, and fourth billing respectively\u2014has a relatively low placing in the [[cast list]], due to its unusual structure. Rather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into three sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list as the head of the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit and Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the most screen time. Similarly, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over Leslie Howard who plays his son, and Clark Gable, who plays only a visitor at Twelve Oaks, receives a relatively low credit in the cast list, despite being presented as the \"[[Movie star|star]]\" of the film in all the promotional literature.<ref name=\"AFIcatalog\">{{cite web |title=Gone With the Wind |work=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/1181 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Following the death of Mary Anderson\u2014who played Maybelle Merriwether\u2014in April 2014, there are only two surviving credited cast members from the film: Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes; and Mickey Kuhn, who played her son, Beau.<ref>{{cite news |first=Claire |last=Noland |title=Mary Anderson Dies at 96; Actress had Role in 'Gone With the Wind' |date=April 8, 2014 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mary-anderson-20140408-story.html |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col}}\n;Tara plantation\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Gerald O'Hara\n* [[Barbara O'Neil]] as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n* [[Vivien Leigh]] as [[Scarlett O'Hara]] (daughter)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[George Reeves]] as Brent Tarleton (actually as Stuart){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton|The credits at the start of the film contain an error: George Reeves is listed \"as Brent Tarleton\", but plays Stuart, while Fred Crane is listed \"as Stuart Tarleton\", but plays Brent.<ref name=AFIcatalog/>}}\n* [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] as Stuart Tarleton (actually as Brent){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton}}\n* [[Hattie McDaniel]] as Mammy (house servant)\n* [[Oscar Polk]] as Pork (house servant)\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Prissy (house servant)\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as Big Sam (field foreman)\n;At Twelve Oaks\n* [[Howard Hickman]] as John Wilkes\n* [[Alicia Rhett]] as [[India Wilkes]] (his daughter)\n* [[Leslie Howard]] as [[Ashley Wilkes]] (his son)\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Melanie Hamilton]] (their cousin)\n* [[Rand Brooks]] as [[Gone with the Wind (novel)#Other characters|Charles Hamilton]] (Melanie's brother)\n* [[Carroll Nye]] as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Rhett Butler]] (a visitor from Charleston)\n;In Atlanta\n* [[Laura Hope Crews]] as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n* [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]] as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Dr. Meade\n* [[Leona Roberts]] as Mrs. Meade\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as Mrs. Merriwether\n* [[Ona Munson]] as Belle Watling\n;Minor supporting roles\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as the Yankee deserter\n* [[Cammie King|Cammie King Conlon]] as Bonnie Blue Butler\n* [[J.

It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht was in the middle of working on the film ''[[At the Circus]]'' for the [[Marx Brothers]]. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend [[Gene Fowler]], he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They acted scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, \"After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic.\"\n\nMacAdams writes, \"It is impossible to determine exactly how much Hecht scripted ... In the official credits filed with the [[Screen Writers Guild]], Sidney Howard was of course awarded the sole screen credit, but four other writers were appended ...

Warner Bros.\u2014who had contracted Steiner in 1936\u2014agreed to lend him to Selznick. Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired, including [[Hugo Friedhofer]], Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, [[Adolph Deutsch]] and Reginald Bassett.\n\nThe score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included [[Stephen Foster]] tunes such as \"Louisiana Belle\", \"Dolly Day\", \"Ringo De Banjo\", \"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\", \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", and \"Katie Belle\", which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: \"Marching through Georgia\" by [[Henry Clay Work]], \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\", \"[[Garryowen (air)|Garryowen]]\", and \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]\". The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical basis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by [[Mack David]]. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score.\n\nDue to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and [[Heinz Roemheld]], and in addition, two short cues\u2014by [[Franz Waxman]] and [[William Axt]]\u2014were taken from scores in the MGM library.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurence E. |last=MacDonald |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History |year=1998 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1-880157-56-5 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT68 52]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT69 53]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Preview, premiere and initial release===\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]], investor [[Jock Whitney|John \"Jock\" Whitney]], and film editor Hal Kern drove out to [[Riverside, California]] to preview the film at the [[Riverside Fox Theater|Fox Theatre]].

''The Guardian'' believed that if \"the story had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme\u2014the collapse and devastation of the Old South\u2014then ''Gone With the Wind'' might have been a really great film\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news |title=From the Archive, 28 May 1940: Gone with the Wind at the Gaiety |date=May 28, 1940 |work=[[The Manchester Guardian]] |publication-date=May 28, 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/may/28/archive-gone-with-the-wind-1940 |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref> Likewise, Hoellering also found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half: identifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the characters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main fault of the picture lay, commenting that \"the characters alone do not suffice\".

failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\",

its epic theme, but\u2014finding agreement with the film's contemporary criticisms\u2014the personal lives take over in the second half, and it ends up losing its theme in unconvincing sentimentality.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\" /> Kauffmann also finds interesting parallels with ''The Godfather'', which had just replaced ''Gone with the Wind'' as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from \"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are romanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or revisionism.<ref name=\"Kauffmann\"

Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, ''Gone with the Wind'' nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering [[freedman]]: a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The inference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials.\n\nWhile perpetuating some [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] myths, the film makes concessions in regard to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler, and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by referring to it only as a \"political meeting\".<ref name=\"Ruiz\">{{cite book |first=W.

Mitchell continued to resist pressure from Selznick and MGM to write a sequel until her death in 1949. In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and [[Universal Studios]] on a budget of $12&nbsp;million. [[Anne Edwards]] was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards submitted a 775-page manuscript entitled ''Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind'', set between 1872 and 1882 focusing on Scarlett's divorce from Rhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.<ref name=\"Bartel\" />\n\nThe idea was revived in the 1990s, when a sequel was finally produced in 1994, in the form of a television [[miniseries]]. ''[[Scarlett (miniseries)|Scarlett]]'' was based upon [[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|the novel]] by [[Alexandra Ripley]], itself a sequel to Mitchell's book. British actors [[Joanne Whalley]] and [[Timothy Dalton]] were cast as Scarlett and Rhett, and the series follows Scarlett's relocation to Ireland after again becoming pregnant by Rhett.<ref name=\"scarlett\">{{cite web |title=Scarlett (1994) |work=[[Allmovie]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/scarlett-v135447 |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring slavery]]\n\n==References==\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book |last=Bridges |first=Herb |year=1999 |title=Gone with the Wind: The Three-Day Premiere in Atlanta |publisher=[[Mercer University Press]] |isbn=978-0-86554-672-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/gonewithwindthre00brid}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Judy |last2=Christman |first2=Paul J |year=1989 |title=The Art of Gone with the Wind: The Making of a Legend |url=https://archive.org/details/artofgonewithwin0000came |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-13-046740-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz |year=1996 |title=On the Road to Tara: The Making of Gone with the Wind |location=New York |publisher=[[Harry N.

R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and awarded a prize from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.\n\n''The Hobbit'' is set within Tolkien's [[fictional universe]] and follows the quest of home-loving [[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular [[hobbit]], to win a share of the treasure guarded by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]]. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view [[J. R. R. Tolkien#First World War|Tolkien's own experiences during World War I]] as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of [[Germanic philology]] and interest in mythology and [[fairy tales]] are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he made retrospective accommodations for it in ''The Hobbit''. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Hobbit characters}}[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved [[hobbit]]\u2014a race resembling very short humans who live in underground houses and are mainly pastoral farmers and gardeners.<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Riding Hood and the Wolf in Bed: Modernism's Fairy Tales |first=Ann |last=Martin |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8020-9086-7 |quote=... \u2014prefigure the bourgeois preoccupations of J.

When they attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] they are caught by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] and driven [[Goblin Town|deep underground]]. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across [[One Ring|a mysterious ring]] and then encounters [[Gollum]], who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers [[invisibility]], Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]] give chase, but the company are saved by [[Eagles (Middle-earth)|eagles]] before resting in the house of [[Beorn]].\n\nThe company enters the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]], who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and\nWhen the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the [[Iron Hills]], reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is only enraged at the betrayal. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.\n\nGandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.\n\nBilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or nehahahahhaa ni obnove zate\n==Concept and creation==\n\n===Background===\n{{Further|Hobbit (word)}}\nIn the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including ''Goblin Feet''<ref>''Oxford Poetry'' (1915) Blackwells</ref> and ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late|The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked]]'',<ref>''Yorkshire Poetry'', Leeds, vol. 2, no. 19, October\u2013November 1923</ref> a reworking of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''. His creative endeavours at this time also included [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] to his children\u2014illustrated manuscripts that featured warring [[gnome]]s and [[goblin]]s, and a helpful [[polar bear]]\u2014alongside the creation of [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven languages]] and an attendant mythology, including the [[Book of Lost Tales]], which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|pages=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1955 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that he began work on ''The Hobbit'' one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including [[C. S. Lewis]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=181}}</ref> and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths.<ref name=\"Letter294\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=294}}</ref> In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book<ref name=\"Letter294\" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=184}}</ref> In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\nThe setting of ''The Hobbit'', as described on its original dust jacket, is ''\"ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men\"'' in an unnamed [[fantasy world]].{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside dustjacket, first flap}} The world is shown on the endpaper map as \"Western Lands\" westward and \"[[Wilderland]]\" as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he decided these stories could fit into the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] he had been working on privately for decades. ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' became the end of the \"[[Third Age]]\" of [[Middle Earth]] within  [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]]. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other posthumous works.\n\n===Influences===\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] polymath [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=7\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=7}}</ref> following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page= vol.2 p.485}}</ref> Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett]]'s historical novel ''[[The Black Douglas (novel)|The Black Douglas]]'' and of basing the Necromancer\u2014[[Sauron]]\u2014on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=391\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=391, quoted by {{Harvnb|Lobdell|2004|p=6}}}}</ref> Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tolkien|1988|p= 150}}</ref> and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lobdell |2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nTolkien's portrayal of goblins in ''The Hobbit'' was particularly influenced by [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=108}}</ref> However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2007|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|Verne's runic cryptogram from ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'']]\n\nTolkien scholar Mark T.

The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, \"Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\" This presages Gollum's portrayal in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nTolkien sent this revised version of the chapter \"Riddles in the Dark\" to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but he heard nothing back for years. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition, Tolkien was surprised to find the sample text had been incorporated.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=215}}</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the original version of the riddle game is explained as a \"lie\" made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the \"true\" account.<ref name = \"prologue\">{{cite book|last=Tolkien |first=J.

However, because of its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], derived from the 16th-century [[Paracelsus]], Tolkien abandoned the term.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |pages= 43\u201344}}</ref> He also changed \"tomatoes\" to \"pickles\" but retained other anachronisms, such as clocks and tobacco. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he has [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] explain that tobacco had been brought from the West by the [[Numenoreans|N\u00famen\u00f3reans]].\n\n====Posthumous editions====\nSince the author's death, two editions of ''The Hobbit'' have been published with commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\". Anderson's commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is also accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them work by [[Tove Jansson]].<ref>An example, alongside other illustrations can be seen at: [http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/hobbit/2_5.shtml Houghton Mifflin]</ref> The edition also presents a number of little-known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkien's poem \"Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden\".\n\nWith ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', published in two parts in 2007, [[John D. Rateliff]] provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.<ref name=\"Fisher\"/>\n\n===Illustration and design===\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobbit runes.png|alt=See caption.|thumb|[[Cirth]] runes and the English letter values assigned to them by Tolkien,<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=378\u2013379}}</ref> used in several of his original illustrations and designs for ''The Hobbit''.]]\n\nEven the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished ''Thror's Map'' to be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the ''moon letter'' [[Cirth]] on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light.<ref name=\"Anderson 2003 page=22\"/> In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, ''Thror's map'', and the ''Map of Wilderland'' (see [[Rhovanion]]), both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=18}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: ''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water'', ''The [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]'', ''The Mountain Path'', ''The [[Misty Mountains]] looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate'', ''[[Beorn]]'s Hall'', ''[[Mirkwood]]'', ''[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]'s Gate'', ''[[Esgaroth|Lake Town]]'', ''The [[Lonely Mountain|Front Gate]]'', and ''The Hall at [[Bag End|Bag-End]]''. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic [[transliteration]] of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.<ref>{{cite book | last=Flieger | first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger | title=Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien's Mythology | publisher=Kent State University Press | year= 2005 | isbn=978-0-87338-824-5 | page=67}}</ref> The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.<ref name=Hammond12-13>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe publisher's production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author's. The spine shows runes: two \"[[Thurisaz (rune)|\u00fe]]\" ([[Thr\u00e1in II|Thr\u00e1in]] and Thr\u00f3r) runes and one \"[[Dagaz|d]]\" (door). The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien's style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=14\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=14}}</ref>\n\nOnce illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water'') in colour and the addition of new colour plates: ''Rivendell'', ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes'', ''Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves'' and ''Conversation with [[Smaug]]'', which features a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarvish]] curse written in Tolkien's invented script [[Tengwar]], and signed with two \"\u00fe\" (\"Th\") runes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=602}}</ref> The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes''.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=20\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=20}}</ref>\n\nDifferent editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions. Some cheaper editions, particularly paperback, are not illustrated except with the maps. \"The Children's Book Club\" edition of 1942 includes the black-and-white pictures but no maps, an anomaly.<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite book | last=Tolkien | first=J.

An important concept in [[anthropology]] and [[child development]], animism is the idea that all things\u2014including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants\u2014possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the \"[[Doctor Dolittle]] Theme\" in ''The History of the Hobbit'', and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the \"roots of mountains\" and \"feet of trees\" in ''The Hobbit'' as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite book | last = Curry | first = Patrick | year = 2004 |title =Defending Middle-earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity | publisher=Mariner Books | isbn=978-0-618-47885-9| page =98 |url= }}</ref> Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: \"...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'.\"<ref>{{cite book| title = The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R.

He portrays Bilbo as a modern [[anachronism]] exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, [[Gollum]]'s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Shippey_Author\">{{cite book|last=Shippey |first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Shippey|title=J.

Tolkien: Author of the Century}}</ref>\n\n[[Smaug]] is the main antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of ''[[Beowulf]]'', and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St. George]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=534}}</ref> Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of [[Pand\u00e6monium (Paradise Lost)|Pand\u00e6monium]] with its \"Belched fire and rolling smoke\" in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name=\"compass\">{{cite book| last=Lobdell | first=Jared | year=1975 | title=A Tolkien Compass | publisher=Open Court Publishing | page=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 106] | isbn=978-0-87548-303-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 }}</ref> Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, using [[idiom]]s such as \"Don't let your imagination run away with you!\"\n\nJust as Tolkien's literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences. ''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile.<ref name=\"great_war_rev\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-cover-book-tolkien-and-the-great-war-by-by-john-garth-80bcv8w75vs|title=Review: Cover book: Tolkien and the Great War by John Garth |last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |date=23 November 2003 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited }}</ref> The tale as such explores the theme of heroism.

[[C. S. Lewis]], friend of Tolkien (and later author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' between 1949 and 1954), writing in ''The Times'' reports:\n\n<blockquote>The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib \"originality.\"</blockquote>\n\nLewis compares the book to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside ''[[Flatland]]'', ''[[Phantastes]]'', and ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=18}}</ref> [[W.

Instead of approaching ''The Hobbit'' as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of ''The Hobbit'' as being a \"prelude\", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres.<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |editor=Hunt, Peter |last=Sullivan |first=C.

The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ([[Goblin Town]]/[[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]); they engage another group of elves ([[Mirkwood]]/[[Lothl\u00f3rien]]); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the [[Dead Marshes]]); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ([[Esgaroth]]/[[Ithilien]]); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/[[Battle of Pelennor Fields]]); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ([[Lonely Mountain]]/[[Mount Doom]]); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ([[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]/[[Aragorn]]); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off / [[the Scouring of the Shire]]).<ref name=\"Kocher\">\n{{cite book |title= Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J.

Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not.<ref name=\"Kocher\"/> Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of [[Middle-earth]] was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |page= 7}}</ref>\n\n===In education===\nThe style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers' literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and awarded a prize from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.\n\n''The Hobbit'' is set within Tolkien's [[fictional universe]] and follows the quest of home-loving [[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular [[hobbit]], to win a share of the treasure guarded by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]]. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view [[J. R. R. Tolkien#First World War|Tolkien's own experiences during World War I]] as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of [[Germanic philology]] and interest in mythology and [[fairy tales]] are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he made retrospective accommodations for it in ''The Hobbit''. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Hobbit characters}}[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved [[hobbit]]\u2014a race resembling very short humans who live in underground houses and are mainly pastoral farmers and gardeners.<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Riding Hood and the Wolf in Bed: Modernism's Fairy Tales |first=Ann |last=Martin |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8020-9086-7 |quote=... \u2014prefigure the bourgeois preoccupations of J.

When the music ends, Gandalf unveils Thr\u00f3r's map showing a [[secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's \"burglar\". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.\n\nThe group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]] and leads them to [[Rivendell]], where [[Elrond]] reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] they are caught by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] and driven [[Goblin Town|deep underground]]. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across [[One Ring|a mysterious ring]] and then encounters [[Gollum]], who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers [[invisibility]], Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]] give chase, but the company are saved by [[Eagles (Middle-earth)|eagles]] before resting in the house of [[Beorn]].\n\nThe company enters the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]], who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and espying a gap in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]. Bard's arrow finds the hollow spot and slays the dragon.\n\nWhen the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the [[Iron Hills]], reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is only enraged at the betrayal. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.\n\nGandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.\n\nBilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns [[Bag End|home]] a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n===Background===\n{{Further|Hobbit (word)}}\nIn the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including ''Goblin Feet''<ref>''Oxford Poetry'' (1915) Blackwells</ref> and ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late|The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked]]'',<ref>''Yorkshire Poetry'', Leeds, vol. 2, no. 19, October\u2013November 1923</ref> a reworking of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''. His creative endeavours at this time also included [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] to his children\u2014illustrated manuscripts that featured warring [[gnome]]s and [[goblin]]s, and a helpful [[polar bear]]\u2014alongside the creation of [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven languages]] and an attendant mythology, including the [[Book of Lost Tales]], which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|pages=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1955 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that he began work on ''The Hobbit'' one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including [[C. S. Lewis]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=181}}</ref> and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths.<ref name=\"Letter294\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=294}}</ref> In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book<ref name=\"Letter294\" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=184}}</ref> In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\nThe setting of ''The Hobbit'', as described on its original dust jacket, is ''\"ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men\"'' in an unnamed [[fantasy world]].{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside dustjacket, first flap}} The world is shown on the endpaper map as \"Western Lands\" westward and \"[[Wilderland]]\" as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he decided these stories could fit into the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] he had been working on privately for decades. ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' became the end of the \"[[Third Age]]\" of [[Middle Earth]] within  [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]]. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other posthumous works.\n\n===Influences===\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] polymath [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=7\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=7}}</ref> following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page= vol.2 p.485}}</ref> Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett]]'s historical novel ''[[The Black Douglas (novel)|The Black Douglas]]'' and of basing the Necromancer\u2014[[Sauron]]\u2014on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=391\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=391, quoted by {{Harvnb|Lobdell|2004|p=6}}}}</ref> Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tolkien|1988|p= 150}}</ref> and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lobdell |2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nTolkien's portrayal of goblins in ''The Hobbit'' was particularly influenced by [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=108}}</ref> However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2007|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|Verne's runic cryptogram from ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'']]\n\nTolkien scholar Mark T.

Tolkien, a scholar of ''Beowulf'', counted the epic among his \"most valued sources\" for ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=31\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=31}}</ref> Tolkien was one of the first critics to treat ''Beowulf'' as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture ''[[Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics]]'' is still required in some Old English courses.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Tolkien borrowed several elements from ''Beowulf'', including a monstrous, intelligent dragon.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{cite journal | last =Steele | first =Felicia Jean | year =2006 | title =Dreaming of dragons: Tolkien's impact on Heaney's Beowulf | journal =Mythlore | issue =95/96 | url =http://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=mythlore|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>  Certain descriptions in ''The Hobbit'' seem to have been lifted straight out of ''Beowulf'' with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders.<ref>{{cite book | last=Faraci | first=Mary | editor-first=Jane | editor-last=Chance | title=Tolkien the Medievalist | publisher=Routledge |year=2002 | pages=58\u201359 | chapter='I wish to speak' (Tolkien's voice in his Beowulf essay) | isbn=978-0-415-28944-3 }}</ref> Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in ''Beowulf''. Other specific plot elements and features in ''The Hobbit'' that show similarities to ''Beowulf'' include the title ''thief'', as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.<ref>{{Harvnb|Solopova|2009|page=37}}</ref> Tolkien refines parts of ''Beowulf''{{'s}} plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purtill | first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard Purtill | title=Lord of the Elves and Eldils | publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-58617-084-4 |url=}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence from Old English sources is the appearance of named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade \"[[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]\" we see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in ''Beowulf'', signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.<ref>{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = R.

However, because of its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], derived from the 16th-century [[Paracelsus]], Tolkien abandoned the term.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |pages= 43\u201344}}</ref> He also changed \"tomatoes\" to \"pickles\" but retained other anachronisms, such as clocks and tobacco. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he has [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] explain that tobacco had been brought from the West by the [[Numenoreans|N\u00famen\u00f3reans]].\n\n====Posthumous editions====\nSince the author's death, two editions of ''The Hobbit'' have been published with commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\". Anderson's commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is also accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them work by [[Tove Jansson]].<ref>An example, alongside other illustrations can be seen at: [http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/hobbit/2_5.shtml Houghton Mifflin]</ref> The edition also presents a number of little-known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkien's poem \"Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden\".\n\nWith ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', published in two parts in 2007, [[John D. Rateliff]] provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.<ref name=\"Fisher\"/>\n\n===Illustration and design===\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise...

He wished ''Thror's Map'' to be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the ''moon letter'' [[Cirth]] on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light.<ref name=\"Anderson 2003 page=22\"/> In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, ''Thror's map'', and the ''Map of Wilderland'' (see [[Rhovanion]]), both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=18}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: ''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water'', ''The [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]'', ''The Mountain Path'', ''The [[Misty Mountains]] looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate'', ''[[Beorn]]'s Hall'', ''[[Mirkwood]]'', ''[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]'s Gate'', ''[[Esgaroth|Lake Town]]'', ''The [[Lonely Mountain|Front Gate]]'', and ''The Hall at [[Bag End|Bag-End]]''. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic [[transliteration]] of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.<ref>{{cite book | last=Flieger | first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger | title=Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien's Mythology | publisher=Kent State University Press | year= 2005 | isbn=978-0-87338-824-5 | page=67}}</ref> The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time.

Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author's. The spine shows runes: two \"[[Thurisaz (rune)|\u00fe]]\" ([[Thr\u00e1in II|Thr\u00e1in]] and Thr\u00f3r) runes and one \"[[Dagaz|d]]\" (door).

The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water'') in colour and the addition of new colour plates: ''Rivendell'', ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes'', ''Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves'' and ''Conversation with [[Smaug]]'', which features a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarvish]] curse written in Tolkien's invented script [[Tengwar]], and signed with two \"\u00fe\" (\"Th\") runes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=602}}</ref> The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes''.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=20\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=20}}</ref>\n\nDifferent editions have been illustrated in diverse ways.

An important concept in [[anthropology]] and [[child development]], animism is the idea that all things\u2014including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants\u2014possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the \"[[Doctor Dolittle]] Theme\" in ''The History of the Hobbit'', and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the \"roots of mountains\" and \"feet of trees\" in ''The Hobbit'' as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite book | last = Curry | first = Patrick | year = 2004 |title =Defending Middle-earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity | publisher=Mariner Books | isbn=978-0-618-47885-9| page =98 |url= }}</ref> Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: \"...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'.\"<ref>{{cite book| title = The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R.

He portrays Bilbo as a modern [[anachronism]] exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, [[Gollum]]'s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Shippey_Author\">{{cite book|last=Shippey |first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Shippey|title=J.

In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of ''[[Beowulf]]'', and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St. George]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=534}}</ref> Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of [[Pand\u00e6monium (Paradise Lost)|Pand\u00e6monium]] with its \"Belched fire and rolling smoke\" in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name=\"compass\">{{cite book| last=Lobdell | first=Jared | year=1975 | title=A Tolkien Compass | publisher=Open Court Publishing | page=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 106] | isbn=978-0-87548-303-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 }}</ref> Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, using [[idiom]]s such as \"Don't let your imagination run away with you!\"\n\nJust as Tolkien's literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences.

[[C. S. Lewis]], friend of Tolkien (and later author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' between 1949 and 1954), writing in ''The Times'' reports:\n\n<blockquote>The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing.

Instead of approaching ''The Hobbit'' as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of ''The Hobbit'' as being a \"prelude\", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres.<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |editor=Hunt, Peter |last=Sullivan |first=C.

The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ([[Goblin Town]]/[[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]); they engage another group of elves ([[Mirkwood]]/[[Lothl\u00f3rien]]); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the [[Dead Marshes]]); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ([[Esgaroth]]/[[Ithilien]]); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/[[Battle of Pelennor Fields]]); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ([[Lonely Mountain]]/[[Mount Doom]]); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ([[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]/[[Aragorn]]); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off / [[the Scouring of the Shire]]).<ref name=\"Kocher\">\n{{cite book |title= Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J. R. R. Tolkien|last= Kocher |first= Paul |year= 1974 |publisher=Penguin |pages= 31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' contains several more supporting scenes, and has a more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not.<ref name=\"Kocher\"/> Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of [[Middle-earth]] was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |page= 7}}</ref>\n\n===In education===\nThe style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers' literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

(former State Printing Company) is one of the largest security printing companies in Hungary and the [[Central and Eastern Europe|CEE]] region. Previously, the company produced traditional printing products. Today its activities are focused on document security products, plastic card production and personalization, [[electronic document management]] and bulk [[transaction printing|transactional printing]]. The company's shares have been listed on the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]] since December 2005.\n\n== The History of the Printing Company ==\n\n=== The beginning ===\n[[File:\u00c1llami Nyomda 01.JPG|right|thumb|280px|The company's F\u00e1tyolka Street entrance]]\nAfter the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] the first independent [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government was formed and the legal predecessor of its state printing house was the branch of the Viennese Imperial and Royal Court and State Printing House which was established by the [[Austria]]n government in [[Timi\u0219oara]] after the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and Independence War. The printing house began operation in 1851 and became the largest institution in a town which already had highly developed printing houses.\n\nIn 1868 the company moved its operation nearer to the government district of [[Buda Castle]] in order to supply the Hungarian government with state administration forms. In those days, the Finance Ministry supervised the Hungarian Royal Cadastral Lithographic Printing House Institute and Map Collection which produced and copied the cadastral (land-register) surveys and maps that served as a basis for land tax. In 1869 the government decided on the merger of the two printing houses, as it was necessary to solve the domestic production of fee [[Revenus stamp|stamp]]s which were very important for the Finance Ministry. Due to the merger and development, the conditions were realized for fast and reliable production of fee stamps, a process which is confidential until publication. This extended to other state administration and treasury forms. The new institution was officially named Hungarian Royal State Printing House.\n\n=== From 1901 with the name State Printing House ===\nAfter the 1901 reorganization, the company's name was changed to State Printing House. The state budget and its justification, the appropriation accounts, the important bills, the Financial Gazette and the time-tables of the Hungarian State Railways were printed in the State Printing House. Hungarian Royal Treasury Notes, different treasury bills, state promissory notes, annuity loan notes, class lottery tickets, blank bills, bills of lading of domestic and foreign freights and cigar and tobacco packaging materials and [[tax stamp]]s were also produced there. The Hungarian government founded the Hungarian Banknote Printing House in 1922 which started domestic banknote printing in August 1923 in the buildings of the State Printing House. During World War II, the printing house served as a war factory producing food and fuel notes. After the war, the documents of the post and the railway were printed again as well as state forms, bonds and [[lottery]] tickets. For the 1945 election, State Printing House printed the election forms, later it produced the tax notes during the 1946 hyperinflation. The company has been producing lottery forms and tickets since 1947. Besides production of lottery forms and tickets, the production of election forms every four years also became stable part of the production portfolio. Due to the investment in 1957, the capacity was expanded and the quality improved, the production of multicolour printed stamps was started. In the 1960 the company began to print export stamps as well.\n\n=== The first Hungarian postage stamp \u2013 1871 ===\nFor the general public, stamp production became the most well-known activity of State Printing House over the decades. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the Hungarian government found it necessary to pay for the postal and office fees with its own stamp in order to emphasize national sovereignty and for financial and administration reasons.  Previously, these fees could be paid for only by parallel-published (Austrian-Hungarian) stamps which were produced in [[Vienna]]. The fee stamps were produced in Hungary from 1869, in the State Printing House managed by the independent Finance Ministry. The provision of the 1867 Compromise concerning postal services came into effect on 1 May. All of the post offices on the territory of Hungary came under the competence of the Hungarian Post Directorate. So a natural claim came forward that independently published Hungarian stamps should be put on the mails of the Hungarian Post. As this claim was approved by the emperor's government, the first Hungarian newspaper stamp was published on 20 June 1868. However, this was printed in the Viennese printing house and a German inscription could be read on the watermark. The inscription on the stamp itself was Hungarian, and the stamp design was decorated by the Hungarian coat of arms and crown. The first postal stamp produced in Hungary was issued in 1871 after the stamp production line of State Printing House was developed.\n\n=== State Printing Company as a private company ===\nAfter the political transition most of the state monopolies ceased to exist and the competition started for the production of those products which were previously produced exclusively by state monopolies. As the state protection ended, there was no other choice but to reconsider the situation of the Company. In view of these facts, the State Printing House was privatised in 1993. For the development of the company, a larger work area, and more modern and cultured working conditions were necessary so the Company moved to [[K\u0151b\u00e1nya]], another district of the capital, from its former building near the Buda Castle. The new printing house in Halom Street was opened officially on 4 October 1994. Meanwhile, the State Printing House took over the equipment and most of the employees of SZ\u00dcV Continuous Form Printing House. A brand new division was included in the portfolio of State Printing House from 1997: plastic card production and personalization. The investment started at the beginning of 1998 and a new modern plant was established in F\u00e1tyolka Street which developed further in 2000 and became able to produce [[chip card]]s. State Printing House established its Document Security Laboratory in 1999 which functions as a centre of [[R&D]] activities. State Printing House started international expansion in 2005 when it founded joint ventures with its local partners in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] and subsidiaries in [[Slovakia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=cca615a0-0442-11e9-9dec-fb16e3bda736&url=L3F1b3RlL0FOWTpQWg==|title=About ANY Security Printing Co|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\n\n'''According to the decision of the Board of Directors of State Printing Company, Registry Court changed the name of State Printing Company PLC to ANY Security Printing Company PLC with effect from 1 February 2013.'''\n\nAfter the Company's privatisation 20 years ago, it started to develop dynamically and now it is a leading security printing company of Hungary and the region.

{"title_page": "List of The Fairly OddParents characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''List of The Fairly OddParents characters'''. [[The Fairly OddParents]] is an [[America|American]] animated television show, created by [[Butch Hartman]].\n==Main==\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n\n===Timmy Turner===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Timmy Turner pose.png|thumb|Timmy Turner]] -->\n\nVoiced by:\n* [[Tara Strong]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] \u2013 Adult Timmy in ''[[Channel Chasers]]'' episode\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] \u2013 ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' shorts\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Drake Bell]] \u2013 Live-action movies\n\nTimothy Tiberiusaurus-rex jr \"Timmy\" Turner is a 10-year-old boy who was given fairy godparents to grant his every wish as a result of his neglectful parents and abuse from Vicky. He wears a pink hat and shirt with blue pants. He also has comically large front teeth, which are usually mocked. His wishes often have unpredictable and problematic side effects, and are often reverted upon Timmy's request by the end of the episode. His interests include comic books, video games, cartoons, and sports. During a time travel trip, Timmy accidentally arrives the day his parents moved into their house; unseen, he learns that they were expecting a girl, hence his pink hat.\n\n===Cosmo===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Daran Norris]]\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Jason Alexander]] (in ''[[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]'')<ref name=\"screenrant.com\" />\n\nCosmo and Wanda are fairy godparents assigned to grant Timmy's, and later Chloe's, wishes. They were previously the godparents of Denzel Crocker, Billy Gates, Tina Turner, and other historical and modern day figures; such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. To avoid being seen by humans other than Timmy, they often disguise themselves as animals or inanimate objects.\n\nCosmo is Wanda's husband, Poof's father, and Timmy and Chloe's godfather. He is known for his stupidity and has been responsible for inadvertently causing disasters since he was born. As explained in \"Fairly Oddbaby\", Cosmo's ability for destruction is such that when he was born, all fairies were henceforth no longer allowed to have children out of the fear that another potential fairy baby would be as bad as or worse than Cosmo. Although he is very laid back and dim, Cosmo is prone to fits of jealousy and becomes defensive when he sees others flirting with Wanda. He was the youngest fairy until Poof was born and, though he was considered an only child in earlier episodes, has a brother named Schnozmo that debuts later. His mother, Mama Cosma, is overprotective of Cosmo and thus despises Wanda. Cosmo has green hair and typically wears a white shirt, black pants, and a black necktie.  \n\n===Wanda===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]]\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] (in [[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]<ref name=\"screenrant.com\">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/fairly-oddparents-movie-alexander-hines-sandy-71777/ |title=Early Look At 'Fairly Oddparents' Movie |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref>)\n\nWanda Venus Cosma (n\u00e9e Fairywinkle) is Cosmo's wife, Poof's mother, and Timmy and Chloe's godmother. She is depicted as being smart and caring. Unlike Cosmo, she tries to prevent Timmy from wishing for things which can be disastrous, though her attempts often fail. However, she is responsible for [[K-t event|the extinction of dinosaurs, 65 million years ago]]. She has a sister, who is a popular actress, named Blonda whom she fights with a lot, as Wanda believes her sister's life as a Soap Star is easier than hers as a housewife. Wanda also has a father named Big Daddy, who also despised Cosmo similar to how Mama Cosma dislikes Wanda but to a much lesser extent. She has pink hair styled with a swirl in front and is usually shown wearing a yellow T-shirt and black pants. Wanda has an [[chocoholic|obsession with chocolate]], and it is one of the only things that can distract her from her top priorities.\n\n===Vicky ===\n<!-- DO NOT MOVE VICKY FROM MAIN --->\nVicky (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], portrayed by Devon Weigel in the live-action movies), is Timmy's rude, selfish, greedy, sadistic, conniving, malicious, and tyrannical 16-year-old babysitter and the main antagonist of the series. She has but a few friends and enjoys torturing children, watching television and making the world miserable, especially for Timmy. She lives with her mother, her father, and her younger sister Tootie. She has encountered Cosmo & Wanda on numerous occasions, but does not believe in them.\n\nAlso, she has encountered Mark Chang in his natural form but dismisses it as a Halloween costume. A plot point in the episode \"Frenemy Mine\" involved her belonging to a dark society known as B.R.A.T. (Babysitters Raging Against Twerps). She has been shown to be accepting of her own cruelty, and that the only reason she is, is that she was mistreated as a child by her own babysitter.\n\n===Poof===\nPoof Cosma (voiced by Tara Strong, Jeff Bennett in ''Certifiable Super Sitter'') is Cosmo and Wanda's son, introduced into the series in the 2008 special ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]''. He was the first fairy baby born in over ten thousand years, with his own father being the second to last. His magical abilities are controlled by his emotions and channeled through his magic rattle. \n\nIn \"Fairy Old Parent\", Poof is assigned to his very first person as a fairy godparent as his own, for miserable old people; such as Mrs. Crocker. He grants her wishes but became overworked and exhausted, returning to Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode \"Certifiable Super Sitter\", Poof returned from Spellementary [[Boarding School]] for spring break. His voice has gotten deeper and more comical as part of his formal training to be a great fairy. Chloe goes completely crazy over him, as she loves babies.\n\n===Sparky===\nSparky (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew Taylor]]) is Timmy's talking fairy dog, who was a character in [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|season 9]], but was dropped from the show before season 10 due to negative reception. Sparky has orange fur, a wand for a tail, a blue nose, and fairy wings. He wears a fairy crown and a blue collar. Sparky's magic tail doesn't work when he is wet. He has magic fleas that will turn people into dogs if bitten. He is highly allergic to pasta, and is capable of performing human acts, such as driving. Unlike Timmy's fairy godparents, it is okay for other people to know about Sparky, but they cannot know that he can talk.\n\n===Chloe Carmichael===\nChloe Carmichael (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is Timmy's neighbor who debuts in the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 10)|season 10]] premiere episode, \"The Big Fairy Share Scare.\" Due to there not being enough fairies available for kids, she and Timmy are forced to share Cosmo and Wanda. Although in the beginning they do not get along, they end up becoming best friends. Chloe is seen by Timmy as an annoying, goody goody, and boastful, little girl and she has the tendency to cause chaos with her wishes.\n\n==Supporting==\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Turner===\nEdgar Turner, also known as Dad or Mr. Turner, (voiced by Daran Norris, portrayed by Norris in the live-action films) and Clemence Turner, also known as Mom or Mrs. Turner, (Susanne Blakeslee, portrayed by [[Teryl Rothery]] in the live-action films) are Timmy's parents. Mom is a real estate agent and home dealer; and Dad works as an employee of a pencil factory called Pencil Nexus and troop leader for Timmy's Squirrelly Scouts Troop, though both have had several other jobs, usually only for a single episode. Mom is shown to be a horrible gardener and cook, as anything she tries to grow dies and her meals usually come alive and try to attack her family. Dad is often shown hating the Dinklebergs, the next door neighbors, which can be compared to [[Homer Simpson]]'s hatred for [[Ned Flanders]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  Both are completely oblivious to the magic in their home, and despite their love for Timmy, tend to be somewhat neglectful. They leave Timmy with Vicky, his babysitter, and are oblivious to signs that she is evil; even going as far as believing that the song \"Icky Vicky\" was about pumpkins.\n\n=== Chester McBadbat ===\nChester McBadbat (voiced by [[Frankie Muniz]] in 2001\u20132003; [[Jason Marsden]] in 2003\u20132017) is one of Timmy's best friends. He lives in a trailer with his father in an impoverished community with few amenities. He is generous and cares more for others than himself, as every time he has obtained magic, he has used his wishes to try to improve the lives of others, even though it usually leads to disaster. He becomes the only classmate of Timmy to know about his godparents' existence in ''[[Fairy Idol]]'', but it is not mentioned again in later episodes. He often wears worn-in, oversized clothes. He has freckles, green eyes, [[dental braces]], and blonde shaggy hair and eyebrows.\n\nHe was played by Chris Anderson in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== A.J. ===\nA.J. (voiced by Ibrahim Haneef Muhammad (2001\u20132003), [[Gary LeRoi Gray]] (2003\u20132017)) is the resident genius in Timmy's class, and one of his best friends. He comes from an upper-middle-class family, and is a straight \"A\" student in school, a quality both his parents have achieved as well. He has constructed an older brother who defends him from bullies, fulfilling his need for a real one. He plays with video games and reads comic books like his other friends, in spite of his superior intellect. He has a secret laboratory that he conceals with a \"cloak\" button on his bedroom wall which, when pressed, converts his lab into a typical bedroom.\n\nHe was played by Jesse Reid in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== Jorgen Von Strangle ===\nJorgen Von Strangle (voiced by [[Daran Norris]], played by [[Mark Gibbon]] in the live-action movies) is the toughest fairy in the universe who speaks with an Austrian accent and is a high-ranking official in Fairy World. Unlike other fairies who \"poof\" from place to place, Jorgen appears and disappears in the form of an atomic explosion and has a [[jet pack]] instead of wings. In \"The Zappies\", he mentioned he has had only one godchild, Winston; the reason for this, as revealed in \"Temporary Fairy\", is that his extreme wish-granting and daredevil stunts unnecessarily endanger the lives of godchildren. He is [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] and enjoys the idea of others cowering in fear of him, which affects his ability to have friends besides Cosmo and Wanda. Although Jorgen is known as the toughest fairy in Fairy World, he is seen multiple times crying in front of Cosmo and Wanda. In 'Teeth for Two', it is revealed that he dated the Tooth Fairy before breaking up over Timmy's teeth. He married her at the end of the episode, but the marriage was not mentioned since. It is revealed in \"Cosmo Rules\" that Cosmo is his distant cousin. \n\n=== Tootie ===\nTootie (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in the TV series, Amber Hood in the ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' episode \"The Fairy Flu\", portrayed in the live-action movies by [[Daniella Monet]]) is Vicky's younger sister. She is a bespectacled girl who has an [[obsessive love|obsessive crush]] on Timmy, often going to the extreme of spying on and stalking him. While Timmy rejects her regularly, he does have a soft spot for her and does nice things for her in several episodes, including sending Cosmo and Wanda out on loan for her birthday after Vicky ruins it. When Vicky isn't torturing the children she babysits, she regularly tortures Tootie at home in substitution.\n\n=== Mark Chang ===\nMark Chang (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is an alien prince from the planet of [[Tyche (hypothetical planet)|Yugopotamia]] (located almost 10,760 astronomical units away from Earth) and one of Timmy's friends. Chang resembles a green squid-like creature with a brain contained in glass. He also features a \"Fake-i-fier\" on his waist, allowing him to shapeshift into objects and human forms. Introduced in \"Spaced Out\", Chang and the other aliens of Yugopotamia are horrified by things commonly considered cute and are attracted to disgusting objects (like manure) and people. As such, Chang has a crush on Vicky, who is unaware that he is a real alien. His parents, King Gripullon and Queen Jipjorrulac (voiced by Paulsen and Laraine Newman, respectively) eventually marry Chang to the vicious, homicidal Princess Mandie (pronounced \"Man-DIE\"). To escape her wrath, Chang relocates to the Dimmsdale Dump on Earth. He also celebrates F.L.A.R.G., a holiday celebrating revolting activities before blowing up the host's planet.\n\n=== Other Fairies ===\n*{{anchor|Binky Abdul|Binky}}'''Binky Abdul''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a meek yet optimistic fairy who is always getting hurt or beaten up by Jorgen.\n*{{anchor|Juandissimo Magnifico|Juandissimo}}'''Juandissimo Magnifico''' (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) is Remy Buxaplenty's fairy godparent who speaks with a Spanish accent. He is often a villain in the episodes in which he appears alongside his godchild, but is actually a kind fairy whom Timmy considers a friend. He is Wanda's ex-boyfriend and is still infatuated over her, much to Cosmo's chagrin. A running gag has him magically tearing off his white T-shirt to show off his muscles and then making it reappear shortly thereafter. In later seasons, Remy Buxaplenty was never heard or seen again.\n*{{anchor|Cupid}}'''Cupid''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is a fairy who promotes love across the universe, yet his arrogance contrasts his love-themed abilities.\n*{{anchor|Tooth Fairy}}'''Tooth Fairy''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is one of the few adult-sized fairies, which is dedicated to changing the teeth that children leave under the pillows for coins, and the wife of Jorgen Von Strangle.\n*{{anchor|Mama Cosma}}'''Mama Cosma''' (voiced by [[Jane Carr]]), Cosmo and Schnozmo's mother, loathes Wanda and repeatedly attempts to get rid of her because of the over-protective bond she has with her son.\n*{{anchor|Blonda Fairywinkle|Blonda}}'''Blonda Fairywinkle''' (voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] in her first appearance and [[Tara Strong]] in all subsequent appearances) is the twin sister of Wanda. She is far more self-centered and vain compared to Wanda. She is the star of the [[soap opera]] \"All My Biceps\" which is Jorgen's favorite show.\n*{{anchor|Dr. Rip Studwell|Rip Studwell|Dr. Studwell}}'''Dr. Rip Studwell''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] in the first appearance, [[Butch Hartman]] in later appearances) is a fairy doctor who insists on being referred to by his full name and usually plays golf and spends time with ladies rather than performing medical procedures.\n*{{anchor|Big Daddy Fairywinkle}}'''Big Daddy Fairywinkle''' (voiced by [[Tony Sirico]]) is the father of Wanda and Blonda. He is the boss of a mafia that has even scared Jorgen before and also has a business that is responsible for cleaning up all of the garbage in Fairy World.\n*{{anchor|Santa Claus}}'''Santa Claus''' (voiced by [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] in his normal form and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in his other form) is the figure of holiday folklore. Outside of Christmas time he is a thin businessman that wears a suit and has neatly trimmed hair. Near Christmas, he is lent magic by all the fairies of the world which transforms him into the most commonly recognized form.\n*{{anchor|Baby New Year}}'''Baby New Year''' is the figure of holiday folklore. He is a giant baby that only speak with a giant \"goo\" and always carries a rattle.\n*{{anchor|The Easter Bunny}}'''The Easter Bunny''' (voiced by [[Robert Costanzo]]) is the figure of holiday folklore. He talks with a Brooklyn mob accent.\n*{{anchor|The April Fool}}'''The April Fool''' (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) is the \"embodiment of comedy\" who is Fairy World's chief comedian and tells jokes very frequently at Uncle Knuckle's Chuckle Bunker. His voice and mannerisms are similar to [[Jerry Seinfeld]].\n\n=== Other Kids ===\n*{{anchor|Elmer}}'''Elmer''' (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, named for [[Butch Hartman]]'s real name) is a nerdy kid and one of Timmy's friends. His most notable feature is the abnormally large boil on his face whom he named Bob (after series animator [[Bob Boyle (animator)|Bob Boyle]]). Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, Bob is sentient and evil. Elmer is the only one who can hear Bob speak and tries to keep his boil in check.\n*{{anchor|Sanjay}}'''Sanjay''' (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is a boy of Indian-American descent who is one of Timmy's friends. He speaks with a high pitched voice, which is accompanied by a strong accent.

Due to Timmy not being popular, Trixie rarely acknowledges his existence, except in secret. It is revealed that she likes comic books, but keeps it a secret to maintain her popularity. There is some debate amongst fans of the show between whom Timmy will end up with due to the end of \"Channel Chasers\", where his children (especially daughter Tammy) have physical similarities of both Trixie and Tootie\n*{{anchor|Veronica}}'''Veronica''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is Trixie Tang's obsessive best friend who wants to be Trixie.

Though he has many standard superhero abilities such as flight, superior strength, and heat vision, his main weapon is his enormous chin, a reference to that of his voice actor. Sometimes, Timmy joins him in his comic book adventures as \"Cleft the Boy Chin Wonder,\" and at other times, the Chin comes to the real world via fairy magic. He lives in \"Chincinnati\", and his alter ego is Charles Hampton \"Chuck\" Indigo, news writer for the Daily Blabbity. \n*{{anchor|Catman}}'''[[Catman (DC Comics)|Catman]]''' (voiced by [[Adam West]] in Season 4-6, [[Jeff Bennett]] in Season 9-10) is Adam West's alter ego, and a good friend of Timmy's.

He and his wife, Mrs. Dinkleberg (voiced by [[Susan Blakeslee]]) do not have any children and so can afford many luxuries that the Turners cannot.\n*{{anchor|Bucky McBadbat}}'''Bucky McBadbat''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is Chester's father and former baseball player who was kicked out of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] for being, per Timmy's words, \"the worst baseball player ever\".

He is a \"Professional Hero\", and she is an \"Extreme Veterinarian\".\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Denzel Crocker===\nDenzel Quincy Crocker, a.k.a. Mr. Crocker (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]], portrayed by [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] in the live-action movies), is a gray-skinned, hunchbacked man and Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher. He correctly suspects that Timmy has fairy godparents of his own, and he is often able to tell what Timmy has wished for by the smallest, most irrelevant clues. His unshakable belief in fairy godparents leads to other adults perceiving him as mentally ill. crocker has been proven to be able to run at speeds of 120MPH and can lift 600 lbs and can worp the fabric of space and time \n\nCrocker has been shown to go to great extents to prove his theory that Timmy has fairy godparents, sinking vast quantities of money into expensive equipment and conducting elaborate experiments. He is also willing to do highly dangerous and immoral things to confirm the belief. For example, in his debut episode, \"Transparents!\", he attempts to test whether Cosmo and Wanda are fairies by trying to get them to sit in an [[electric chair]]. He states that, \"If they survive, they're fairies!\" but \"If they don't, I have [[tenure]]!\"\n\nSurprisingly, Crocker is the previous godchild of Cosmo and Wanda. Though he lost them and the memories of their time with him, his belief in fairies remains. Timmy tries to alter this event via time travel in \"The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker!\", but he paradoxically fails and becomes the reason Crocker lost Cosmo and Wanda and made him remember his belief in fairies.\n\nAlthough being a middle-aged man, he still lives with his mother, Dolores Crocker. His father has never been seen or mentioned in the series.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Crocker served for many decades as the main power source for fairy magic; his belief is so strong that it was used to power the Big Wand, the source of all the magic in Fairy World. In one episode, this leads to the Big Wand losing all its power after he is hypnotized into believing fairies do not exist. To remedy this, Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, Poof, and Jorgen make it so that everyone as equally crazy about fairies as Crocker is used as a source of power for the Big Wand.\n\n===Francis===\nFrancis (voiced by Faith Abrahams) is the school bully and another of Timmy's enemies. He has grey skin and a low pitched voice, and his clothes and underwear are ragged. In \"It's a Wishful Life\" it is revealed that if Timmy did not exist, Francis would funnel all of the aggression he expends bullying into football. \n\n===Anti-Fairies===\nThe Anti-Fairies, as their name suggests, are the evil opposite of fairies. The anti-fairies are responsible for all the bad luck on earth and, according to Cosmo, [[Friday the 13th]] is their \"Christmas\". Each fairy has an anti-fairy counterpart, who is their opposite in both personality and morality.\n\n{{anchor|Anti-Cosmo|Anti-Wanda}}'''Anti-Cosmo''' ([[Daran Norris]]) is portrayed as a cynical, evil, sadistic, and intelligent anti-fairy with a British accent, and is hinted to be the leader of the Anti-Fairies, while '''Anti-Wanda''' ([[Susanne Blakeslee]]), is portrayed as a dumb, hillbilly fairy who eats with her feet.\n\nThe Anti-Fairies reside in Anti-Fairy World, an enclosed environment within Fairy World, first shown as a chamber with a gate guarded by Jorgen. After Timmy accidentally set them free on Earth, Anti-Fairy World was turned into a prison-styled containment facility, where residents live in cells and wear suits preventing them from using magic. The high levels of security were still deemed penetrable, due in part to a specific group effort to get Anti-Cosmo out of Anti-Fairy World to be used as a donor for an operation. The Anti-Fairies serve as the main villains of ''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide'', ''Fairly OddBaby'', and ''Fairy Oddlympics''. They are fairly important villains early in the series, but have made few appearances after Poof is introduced.\n\n{{anchor|Anti Sparky|Anti-Sparky}}'''Anti Sparky''' is the evil version of Sparky who appeared in the episode \"Man's Worst Friend\". Unlike Sparky who is stupid yet very loyal and friendly, Anti Sparky is smart and takes advice from nobody.\n\n====Foop====\n[[File:Foop costume (3757044958).jpg|200px|thumb]]\nFoop (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]], portrayed by [[Scott Baio]] in ''[[A Fairly Odd Summer]]'') is the evil counterpart of Poof and the son of Anti-Cosmo and Anti-Wanda. Because Poof is so nice and attracts so much positive attention, Foop is portrayed as evil and extremely jealous of his counterpart. Foop wants nothing but to destroy Poof, and he cares not for anyone who gets in his way. Unlike Poof, who causes bad things to happen when he cries, Foop's cause good things to happen. \n\nFoop resembles Poof, but he is shaped like a cube rather than a ball. He also has a black mustache and goatee, the kind typically seen on stereotypical villains. Foop has bat wings and a black crown, and his wand is a baby bottle with bat wings on the side. He also speaks with a stereotypical British gentleman accent.\n\n===Pixies, Inc.===\nPixies, Inc. is an organization of magical pixies (all voiced by [[Ben Stein]]) who are similar to fairies but portrayed as monotonous, nearly identical businessmen who do not like anything amusing or fun. The pixies have square physical features, utilize [[mobile phones]] instead of wands, dress in predominantly greyscale outfits with cone-shaped hats, and require that wishes be submitted as multiple written copies and be subject to approval. When they warp from place to place, they use \"ping\" clouds instead of the fairies' traditional \"poof\" clouds. The Head Pixie (H.P.) and Sanderson are the two leaders of Pixies, Inc. On numerous occasions, they have attempted to take over Fairy World and replace all fairies with pixies using elaborate business schemes.  \n\n===Doctor Bender===\nDoctor Bender (voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]] in \"The Same Game\", \"Scary GodParents\", and \"Shiny Teeth\"; [[Butch Hartman]] onwards) is an evil dentist. He has an obsession with perfect teeth, wears dentures that keep his mouth in a perpetual smile, and is intolerant toward anyone who does not have quality teeth. His son, Wendell (also voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and later Butch Hartman), is almost identical to his father in appearance and is also tooth-hygienic, but hates it when his father scares off other kids. Doctor Bender enjoys performing pointless procedures on children's teeth and encourages children to eat refined sugar to boost his business.\n\n===Dark Laser===\nDark Laser (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a science fiction character who is first seen as an image of a catalog toy before Timmy brings him to life in \"Hard Copy\". In \"Escape from Unwish Island,\" Dark Laser is among the Unwished characters that work for Imaginary Gary. He becomes a recurring villain in season six, appearing in \"Mission: Responsible\", \"The End of Universe-ity\", \"Dread 'n' Breakfast\", \"Please Don't Feed The Turners\" and \"Momnipresent\". He parodies [[Darth Vader]] of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series. He is often seen carrying his mechanical toy dog Flipsy, whose backflipping function always makes him giggle.\n\n===Norm the Genie===\nNorm (voiced by [[Norm Macdonald]] in the series and by Robert Cait in \"[[Fairy Idol]]\") is a [[jinn|genie]] tired of being bound to his [[lava lamp]], into which he must return after being released and granting three wishes to his releaser. While there are no rules as to what wishes he can grant, he is deceptive and can find clever ways to subvert his master's expectations. After Timmy outsmarts him in his first appearance, he [[collusion|colludes]] with Crocker in his second appearance to get revenge on Timmy. In the special episode \"[[Fairy Idol]]\", he formulates a scheme to become a fairy godparent so he can escape his lamp and sabotages a \"Fairy Idol\" contest (parodying ''[[American Idol]]'') to reach this goal.\n\n===Princess Mandie===\nPrincess Mandie a.k.a. Man-DIE (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is Mark Chang's terrifying though beautiful former fiance\u00e9, a barbaric extraterrestrial princess who can be described as psychotically violent. Antagonized by Mark's intimidation about her and his refusal to marry her, Mandie constantly plots revengeful, bloodthirsty murder against him. It was later revealed Mandie never loved Mark and only wanted to marry him as a way of seizing power. Mandie was eventually defeated by Vicky when Timmy and Mark tricked Vicky into attacking her.\n\n===Remy Buxaplenty===\nRemy Buxaplenty (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an [[archetypical]] privileged wealthy child, and one of Timmy's rivals. Despite being very rich, Remy is usually unhappy due to his neglectful, wealth-distracted parents, which is the reason why he has a fairy godparent, Wanda's ex-boyfriend Juandissimo. Both Remy and Timmy are aware of each other's fairy godparents, and Remy continuously tries to remove Timmy's fairies, primarily out of jealousy of not having both fairy and human parents who love him. Other than Timmy, and later, Chloe, he is the only known child in the series with a fairy godparent, though many episodes have featured a cameo of at least one unknown child with their fairy godparent. His last name is a pun of \"Bucks aplenty.\" He wasn't seen or heard in later seasons.\n\n===Crimson Chin Villains===\nThe enemies of Crimson Chin that threaten Chincinnati.\n\n*{{anchor|The Bronze Kneecap|Bronze Kneecap}}'''The Bronze Kneecap''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is the archenemy of the Crimson Chin and the founder of the Body of Evil. His origin story is explained in the episode \"The Masked Magician\": he was born Ron Hambone, a [[jai alai]] player famous for his numerous third-place wins. At one point, he was about to claim a first-place win for the first time, only to trip over the Crimson Chin's eponymous chin and break one of his knees. This led him to melt his trophies into a bronze cast suit of armor, inspiring his villain name. His particular ability involves shooting various weapons out of the kneecap pieces of his suit. He once tried to have his enemy pulverised by strapping him to a giant mechanical leg and have a giant doctor robot test the leg's reflex while simultaneously smashing the Chin, later revealed as part of a plan to destroy the City Hall via the leg's reflex kicking a giant soccer ball towards it.\n*{{anchor|Nega Chin}}'''Nega Chin''' (voiced by [[Jay Leno]]) is the evil twin of the Crimson Chin, who possesses the same powers.

He is very fond of disco and has a golden tooth. He appears in both the Crimson Chin webcomics, in which he tried to destroy any and all theaters that no longer showed his films (including the Someguy Asian-American theater due to them never allowing Arches to put his feet in their cement) and the video game [[The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' da Rules|Breakin' da Rules]], in which he steals the Chin's speed.\n*{{anchor|The Titanium Toenail|Titanium Toenail}}'''The Titanium Toenail''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He has the ability to shoot from his helmet sharp projectiles shaped like toenail clippings, which can cut through metal.\n*{{anchor|The Iron Lung|Iron Lung}}'''The Iron Lung''' is a metal-based villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He is a robotic enemy that uses the power of wind, which he uses to blow heavy gusts at his enemies as well as vacuum anything in his path.

As his name suggests, he is distinguished by his short temper, which lights the fuse on the hat he wears; and he literally explodes when others call him \"small\", \"short\" and \"tiny\".\n\n===The Darkness===\n'''The Darkness''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an ancient entity that has existed for millennia and the main antagonist in the first two thirds of the \"Wishology\" trilogy.

In \"Wishology 3: The Final Ending\", the Darkness' true intentions are revealed: it only wants to alleviate its lonely existence by making friends, but it frightens everyone on almost every planet it visits. Together, Timmy, Turbo Thunder, and their friends transform the Darkness into a light being called \"The Kindness\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{The Fairly OddParents}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Fairly OddParents'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Characters In The Fairly Oddparents}}\n[[Category:The Fairly OddParents]]\n[[Category:Nicktoon characters|Fairly Oddparents The]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|Fairly OddParents, The]]\n[[Category:Lists of children's television characters|Fairly OddParents]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''List of The Fairly OddParents characters'''. [[The Fairly OddParents]] is an [[America|American]] animated television show, created by [[Butch Hartman]].\n==Main==\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n\n===Timmy Turner===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Timmy Turner pose.png|thumb|Timmy Turner]] -->\n\nVoiced by:\n* [[Tara Strong]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] \u2013 Adult Timmy in ''[[Channel Chasers]]'' episode\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] \u2013 ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' shorts\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Drake Bell]] \u2013 Live-action movies\n\nTimothy Tiberius \"Timmy\" Turner is a 10-year-old boy who was given fairy godparents to grant his every wish as a result of his neglectful parents and abuse from Vicky. He wears a pink hat and shirt with blue pants. He also has comically large front teeth, which are usually mocked. His wishes often have unpredictable and problematic side effects, and are often reverted upon Timmy's request by the end of the episode. His interests include comic books, video games, cartoons, and sports. During a time travel trip, Timmy accidentally arrives the day his parents moved into their house; unseen, he learns that they were expecting a girl, hence his pink hat.\n\n===Cosmo===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Daran Norris]]\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Jason Alexander]] (in ''[[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]'')<ref name=\"screenrant.com\" />\n\nCosmo and Wanda are fairy godparents assigned to grant Timmy's, and later Chloe's, wishes. They were previously the godparents of Denzel Crocker, Billy Gates, Tina Turner, and other historical and modern day figures; such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. To avoid being seen by humans other than Timmy, they often disguise themselves as animals or inanimate objects.\n\nCosmo is Wanda's husband, Poof's father, and Timmy and Chloe's godfather. He is known for his stupidity and has been responsible for inadvertently causing disasters since he was born. As explained in \"Fairly Oddbaby\", Cosmo's ability for destruction is such that when he was born, all fairies were henceforth no longer allowed to have children out of the fear that another potential fairy baby would be as bad as or worse than Cosmo. Although he is very laid back and dim, Cosmo is prone to fits of jealousy and becomes defensive when he sees others flirting with Wanda. He was the youngest fairy until Poof was born and, though he was considered an only child in earlier episodes, has a brother named Schnozmo that debuts later. His mother, Mama Cosma, is overprotective of Cosmo and thus despises Wanda. Cosmo has green hair and typically wears a white shirt, black pants, and a black necktie.  \n\n===Wanda===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]]\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] (in [[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]<ref name=\"screenrant.com\">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/fairly-oddparents-movie-alexander-hines-sandy-71777/ |title=Early Look At 'Fairly Oddparents' Movie |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref>)\n\nWanda Venus Cosma (n\u00e9e Fairywinkle) is Cosmo's wife, Poof's mother, and Timmy and Chloe's godmother. She is depicted as being smart and caring. Unlike Cosmo, she tries to prevent Timmy from wishing for things which can be disastrous, though her attempts often fail. However, she is responsible for [[K-t event|the extinction of dinosaurs, 65 million years ago]]. She has a sister, who is a popular actress, named Blonda whom she fights with a lot, as Wanda believes her sister's life as a Soap Star is easier than hers as a housewife. Wanda also has a father named Big Daddy, who also despised Cosmo similar to how Mama Cosma dislikes Wanda but to a much lesser extent. She has pink hair styled with a swirl in front and is usually shown wearing a yellow T-shirt and black pants. Wanda has an [[chocoholic|obsession with chocolate]], and it is one of the only things that can distract her from her top priorities.\n\n===Vicky ===\n<!-- DO NOT MOVE VICKY FROM MAIN --->\nVicky (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], portrayed by Devon Weigel in the live-action movies), is Timmy's rude, selfish, greedy, sadistic, conniving, malicious, and tyrannical 16-year-old babysitter and the main antagonist of the series. She has but a few friends and enjoys torturing children, watching television and making the world miserable, especially for Timmy. She lives with her mother, her father, and her younger sister Tootie. She has encountered Cosmo & Wanda on numerous occasions, but does not believe in them.\n\nAlso, she has encountered Mark Chang in his natural form but dismisses it as a Halloween costume. A plot point in the episode \"Frenemy Mine\" involved her belonging to a dark society known as B.R.A.T. (Babysitters Raging Against Twerps). She has been shown to be accepting of her own cruelty, and that the only reason she is, is that she was mistreated as a child by her own babysitter.\n\n===Poof===\nPoof Cosma (voiced by Tara Strong, Jeff Bennett in ''Certifiable Super Sitter'') is Cosmo and Wanda's son, introduced into the series in the 2008 special ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]''. He was the first fairy baby born in over ten thousand years, with his own father being the second to last. His magical abilities are controlled by his emotions and channeled through his magic rattle. \n\nIn \"Fairy Old Parent\", Poof is assigned to his very first person as a fairy godparent as his own, for miserable old people; such as Mrs. Crocker. He grants her wishes but became overworked and exhausted, returning to Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode \"Certifiable Super Sitter\", Poof returned from Spellementary [[Boarding School]] for spring break. His voice has gotten deeper and more comical as part of his formal training to be a great fairy. Chloe goes completely crazy over him, as she loves babies.\n\n===Sparky===\nSparky (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew Taylor]]) is Timmy's talking fairy dog, who was a character in [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|season 9]], but was dropped from the show before season 10 due to negative reception. Sparky has orange fur, a wand for a tail, a blue nose, and fairy wings. He wears a fairy crown and a blue collar. Sparky's magic tail doesn't work when he is wet. He has magic fleas that will turn people into dogs if bitten. He is highly allergic to pasta, and is capable of performing human acts, such as driving. Unlike Timmy's fairy godparents, it is okay for other people to know about Sparky, but they cannot know that he can talk.\n\n===Chloe Carmichael===\nChloe Carmichael (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is Timmy's neighbor who debuts in the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 10)|season 10]] premiere episode, \"The Big Fairy Share Scare.\" Due to there not being enough fairies available for kids, she and Timmy are forced to share Cosmo and Wanda. Although in the beginning they do not get along, they end up becoming best friends. Chloe is seen by Timmy as an annoying, goody goody, and boastful, little girl and she has the tendency to cause chaos with her wishes.\n\n==Supporting==\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Turner===\nEdgar Turner, also known as Dad or Mr. Turner, (voiced by Daran Norris, portrayed by Norris in the live-action films) and Clemence Turner, also known as Mom or Mrs. Turner, (Susanne Blakeslee, portrayed by [[Teryl Rothery]] in the live-action films) are Timmy's parents. Mom is a real estate agent and home dealer; and Dad works as an employee of a pencil factory called Pencil Nexus and troop leader for Timmy's Squirrelly Scouts Troop, though both have had several other jobs, usually only for a single episode. Mom is shown to be a horrible gardener and cook, as anything she tries to grow dies and her meals usually come alive and try to attack her family. Dad is often shown hating the Dinklebergs, the next door neighbors, which can be compared to [[Homer Simpson]]'s hatred for [[Ned Flanders]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  Both are completely oblivious to the magic in their home, and despite their love for Timmy, tend to be somewhat neglectful. They leave Timmy with Vicky, his babysitter, and are oblivious to signs that she is evil; even going as far as believing that the song \"Icky Vicky\" was about pumpkins.\n\n=== Chester McBadbat ===\nChester McBadbat (voiced by [[Frankie Muniz]] in 2001\u20132003; [[Jason Marsden]] in 2003\u20132017) is one of Timmy's best friends. He lives in a trailer with his father in an impoverished community with few amenities. He is generous and cares more for others than himself, as every time he has obtained magic, he has used his wishes to try to improve the lives of others, even though it usually leads to disaster. He becomes the only classmate of Timmy to know about his godparents' existence in ''[[Fairy Idol]]'', but it is not mentioned again in later episodes. He often wears worn-in, oversized clothes. He has freckles, green eyes, [[dental braces]], and blonde shaggy hair and eyebrows.\n\nHe was played by Chris Anderson in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== A.J. ===\nA.J. (voiced by Ibrahim Haneef Muhammad (2001\u20132003), [[Gary LeRoi Gray]] (2003\u20132017)) is the resident genius in Timmy's class, and one of his best friends. He comes from an upper-middle-class family, and is a straight \"A\" student in school, a quality both his parents have achieved as well.

In \"The Zappies\", he mentioned he has had only one godchild, Winston; the reason for this, as revealed in \"Temporary Fairy\", is that his extreme wish-granting and daredevil stunts unnecessarily endanger the lives of godchildren. He is [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] and enjoys the idea of others cowering in fear of him, which affects his ability to have friends besides Cosmo and Wanda. Although Jorgen is known as the toughest fairy in Fairy World, he is seen multiple times crying in front of Cosmo and Wanda.

Mr. Crocker (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]], portrayed by [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] in the live-action movies), is a gray-skinned, hunchbacked man and Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher. He correctly suspects that Timmy has fairy godparents of his own, and he is often able to tell what Timmy has wished for by the smallest, most irrelevant clues. His unshakable belief in fairy godparents leads to other adults perceiving him as mentally ill. crocker has been proven to be able to run at speeds of 120MPH and can lift 600 lbs and can worp the fabric of space and time \n\nCrocker has been shown to go to great extents to prove his theory that Timmy has fairy godparents, sinking vast quantities of money into expensive equipment and conducting elaborate experiments. He is also willing to do highly dangerous and immoral things to confirm the belief. For example, in his debut episode, \"Transparents!\", he attempts to test whether Cosmo and Wanda are fairies by trying to get them to sit in an [[electric chair]]. He states that, \"If they survive, they're fairies!\" but \"If they don't, I have [[tenure]]!\"\n\nSurprisingly, Crocker is the previous godchild of Cosmo and Wanda. Though he lost them and the memories of their time with him, his belief in fairies remains.

His father has never been seen or mentioned in the series.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Crocker served for many decades as the main power source for fairy magic; his belief is so strong that it was used to power the Big Wand, the source of all the magic in Fairy World. In one episode, this leads to the Big Wand losing all its power after he is hypnotized into believing fairies do not exist.

After Timmy accidentally set them free on Earth, Anti-Fairy World was turned into a prison-styled containment facility, where residents live in cells and wear suits preventing them from using magic. The high levels of security were still deemed penetrable, due in part to a specific group effort to get Anti-Cosmo out of Anti-Fairy World to be used as a donor for an operation. The Anti-Fairies serve as the main villains of ''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide'', ''Fairly OddBaby'', and ''Fairy Oddlympics''.

Because Poof is so nice and attracts so much positive attention, Foop is portrayed as evil and extremely jealous of his counterpart. Foop wants nothing but to destroy Poof, and he cares not for anyone who gets in his way.

When they warp from place to place, they use \"ping\" clouds instead of the fairies' traditional \"poof\" clouds. The Head Pixie (H.P.) and Sanderson are the two leaders of Pixies, Inc. On numerous occasions, they have attempted to take over Fairy World and replace all fairies with pixies using elaborate business schemes.  \n\n===Doctor Bender===\nDoctor Bender (voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]] in \"The Same Game\", \"Scary GodParents\", and \"Shiny Teeth\"; [[Butch Hartman]] onwards) is an evil dentist.

He becomes a recurring villain in season six, appearing in \"Mission: Responsible\", \"The End of Universe-ity\", \"Dread 'n' Breakfast\", \"Please Don't Feed The Turners\" and \"Momnipresent\". He parodies [[Darth Vader]] of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series.

While there are no rules as to what wishes he can grant, he is deceptive and can find clever ways to subvert his master's expectations. After Timmy outsmarts him in his first appearance, he [[collusion|colludes]] with Crocker in his second appearance to get revenge on Timmy.

Despite being very rich, Remy is usually unhappy due to his neglectful, wealth-distracted parents, which is the reason why he has a fairy godparent, Wanda's ex-boyfriend Juandissimo. Both Remy and Timmy are aware of each other's fairy godparents, and Remy continuously tries to remove Timmy's fairies, primarily out of jealousy of not having both fairy and human parents who love him. Other than Timmy, and later, Chloe, he is the only known child in the series with a fairy godparent, though many episodes have featured a cameo of at least one unknown child with their fairy godparent. His last name is a pun of \"Bucks aplenty.\" He wasn't seen or heard in later seasons.\n\n===Crimson Chin Villains===\nThe enemies of Crimson Chin that threaten Chincinnati.\n\n*{{anchor|The Bronze Kneecap|Bronze Kneecap}}'''The Bronze Kneecap''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is the archenemy of the Crimson Chin and the founder of the Body of Evil.

At one point, he was about to claim a first-place win for the first time, only to trip over the Crimson Chin's eponymous chin and break one of his knees. This led him to melt his trophies into a bronze cast suit of armor, inspiring his villain name. His particular ability involves shooting various weapons out of the kneecap pieces of his suit.
