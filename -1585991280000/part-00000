Ltd]] starring [[Saurabh Raj Jain]] as [[Shri Krishna]], [[Shaheer Sheikh]] as [[Arjuna|Arjun]], [[Pooja Sharma]] as [[Draupadi]], [[Aham Sharma]] as [[Karn]]a, [[Arav Chowdhary]] as [[Bhishma]], [[Arpit Ranka]] as [[Duryodhan]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Mahabharat'' tells the story of [[Hastinapur]], a kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan where the Kaurava and the Pandava brothers compete for its throne. The Pandavas are the sons of Pandu, and the Kauravas are the sons of Dhritrashtra. Yudhistira (the eldest Pandav brother) and Duryodhan, the eldest Kaurava brother, claim to be next in the line of succession.\n\nThe story begins with Devavrata, the son of Shantanu and Ganga and a disciple of Parshuram. Devavrata earns the name Bhisma by taking an oath of celibacy to fulfill his father's wish to marry [[Satyavati]]. He also vows to serve the throne of Hastinapur and is granted ''icchya-mrityu'' (the ability to live forever, as long as he does not choose to die). Bhisma gives up his rightful throne, and Satyavati rules the kingdom as the Rajmaata (mother of the king) after her husband's death. Her son, Vichitravirya, is an alcoholic who is dependent on Bhisma. He cannot rule the kingdom, leading Satyavati to decide that Vichitravirya's future son must rule the kingdom. Since Vichitravirya is unable to choose a wife for himself, Bhisma must do it for him.\n\nThe three princesses of the Salva kingdom (Amba, Ambika, and Ambalika) are won over by Bhisma, who takes them to Hastinapur to be married to Vichitravirya. Amba has already chosen a groom, however, and demands to be released. Although she returns to her lover, she is scorned as the rejected wife of another man. Vichitravirya then marries Ambika and Ambalika.\n\nWhen Amba demands justice, she is given the option of marrying Vichitravirya and becoming the queen of Hastinapur. She asks Bhisma to marry her instead, since it was he who won her. Bhisma refuses due to his oath of celibacy, angering Amba; Lord Shiva grants her rebirth with a memory of the past and the fate to cause Bhisma's death. Reborn as Shikandi in the Panchal Kingdom, she participates in Bhisma's death.\n\nBhisma asks for Gandhari's hand in marriage for his blind nephew Dhritarashtra, infuriating her brother Shakuni. He persuades Shakuni, however, since Dhritrashtra would be the future king of Hastinapur. During the coronation ceremony, Dhritrashtra's younger brother Pandu is crowned king due to the influence of Vidur (another of Dhritrashtra's younger brothers). Shakuni, feeling cheated, swears to destroy the Kurus. He turns Duryodhana against the Pandavas and sows the seeds of the Kurukshetra War, where Lord Krishna gives the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' to his Pandava cousin Arjuna. The war results in the deaths of many, including Bhisma, Drona, Karna and the sons of Dhritrashtra and Gandhari. Yudhisthira becomes the rightful king of Hastinapur and his wife, Draupadi, becomes queen.\n\nIn Kuntibhoj, Princess Kunti obtains a boon from the sage Durvasa enabling her to invoke any deity and bear his child. She tests the blessing, calling on the Sun God and being given a son named Karna. An unmarried woman, Kunti sets Karna afloat on the [[Ganges]] to avoid embarrassment. She later marries Pandu, son of Vichitravirya, and invokes other deities to give her three sons: Yudhistira, Bhima, and Arjuna.[[Kunti]] helps [[Madri]], Pandu's second wife, by invoking the Ashwini Kumaras to bear Nakula and Sahadeva. As Madri and Pandu die because of a curse by Rishi Kimdam, Kunti decides to raise the five children together.\n\nKarna is raised by a charioteer named Adirath and his wife, Radha. Belonging to a lower-caste family, he is often mistreated but becomes a skilled archer. Karna's true identity is not revealed until the end of the Kurukshetra War. Duryodhana (enemy of the Pandavas) is his only supporter; Karna vows to protect him, and fights for him during the [[Kurukshetra War]]. \n\nArjuna wins the [[Swayamvara|Swayamwara]] of Draupadi; Kunti mistakenly orders her to be shared by the five Pandavas, who eventually marry her. Draupadi is later insulted and disrobed in the Game of Dice by Duryodhana and the rest of the Kauravas, and the Pandavas swear to avenge her.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main ===\n{|class=\"wikitable

Ltd]] starring [[Saurabh Raj Jain]] as [[Shri Krishna]], [[Shaheer Sheikh]] as [[Arjuna|Arjun]], [[Pooja Sharma]] as [[Draupadi]], [[Aham Sharma]] as [[Karn]]a, [[Arav Chowdhary]] as [[Bhishma]], [[Arpit Ranka]] as [[Duryodhan]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Mahabharat'' tells the story of [[Hastinapur]], a kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan where the Kaurava and the Pandava brothers compete for its throne. The Pandavas are the sons of Pandu, and the Kauravas are the sons of Dhritrashtra. Yudhistira (the eldest Pandav brother) and Duryodhan, the eldest Kaurava brother, claim to be next in the line of succession.\n\nThe story begins with Devavrata, the son of Shantanu and Ganga and a disciple of Parshuram. Devavrata earns the name Bhisma by taking an oath of celibacy to fulfill his father's wish to marry [[Satyavati]]. He also vows to serve the throne of Hastinapur and is granted ''icchya-mrityu'' (the ability to live forever, as long as he does not choose to die). Bhisma gives up his rightful throne, and Satyavati rules the kingdom as the Rajmaata (mother of the king) after her husband's death. Her son, Vichitravirya, is an alcoholic who is dependent on Bhisma. He cannot rule the kingdom, leading Satyavati to decide that Vichitravirya's future son must rule the kingdom. Since Vichitravirya is unable to choose a wife for himself, Bhisma must do it for him.\n\nThe three princesses of the Salva kingdom (Amba, Ambika, and Ambalika) are won over by Bhisma, who takes them to Hastinapur to be married to Vichitravirya. Amba has already chosen a groom, however, and demands to be released. Although she returns to her lover, she is scorned as the rejected wife of another man. Vichitravirya then marries Ambika and Ambalika.\n\nWhen Amba demands justice, she is given the option of marrying Vichitravirya and becoming the queen of Hastinapur. She asks Bhisma to marry her instead, since it was he who won her. Bhisma refuses due to his oath of celibacy, angering Amba; Lord Shiva grants her rebirth with a memory of the past and the fate to cause Bhisma's death. Reborn as Shikandi in the Panchal Kingdom, she participates in Bhisma's death.\n\nBhisma asks for Gandhari's hand in marriage for his blind nephew Dhritarashtra, infuriating her brother Shakuni. He persuades Shakuni, however, since Dhritrashtra would be the future king of Hastinapur. During the coronation ceremony, Dhritrashtra's younger brother Pandu is crowned king due to the influence of Vidur (another of Dhritrashtra's younger brothers). Shakuni, feeling cheated, swears to destroy the Kurus. He turns Duryodhana against the Pandavas and sows the seeds of the Kurukshetra War, where Lord Krishna gives the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' to his Pandava cousin Arjuna. The war results in the deaths of many, including Bhisma, Drona, Karna and the sons of Dhritrashtra and Gandhari. Yudhisthira becomes the rightful king of Hastinapur and his wife, Draupadi, becomes queen.\n\nIn Kuntibhoj, Princess Kunti obtains a boon from the sage Durvasa enabling her to invoke any deity and bear his child. She tests the blessing, calling on the Sun God and being given a son named Karna. An unmarried woman, Kunti sets Karna afloat on the [[Ganges]] to avoid embarrassment. She later marries Pandu, son of Vichitravirya, and invokes other deities to give her three sons: Yudhistira, Bhima, and Arjuna.[[Kunti]] helps [[Madri]], Pandu's second wife, by invoking the Ashwini Kumaras to bear Nakula and Sahadeva. As Madri and Pandu die because of a curse by Rishi Kimdam, Kunti decides to raise the five children together.\n\nKarna is raised by a charioteer named Adirath and his wife, Radha. Belonging to a lower-caste family, he is often mistreated but becomes a skilled archer. Karna's true identity is not revealed until the end of the Kurukshetra War. Duryodhana (enemy of the Pandavas) is his only supporter; Karna vows to protect him, and fights for him during the [[Kurukshetra War]]. \n\nArjuna wins the [[Swayamvara|Swayamwara]] of Draupadi; Kunti mistakenly orders her to be shared by the five Pandavas, who eventually marry her. Draupadi is later insulted and disrobed in the Game of Dice by Duryodhana and the rest of the Kauravas, and the Pandavas swear to avenge her.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main ===\n{|class=\"wikitable

While M\u0101ori cultivated small areas, relying on extensive forests for berry, birds and roots, settlers expanded their production capacity by burning forest and fern and planting grass seed in the ashes. Some influential chiefs including [[Te Rauparaha]] opposed land sales in the 1840s (culminating in the 1843 [[Wairau Affray]]), and the view became more widespread in the following decade, when the [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] (European) population grew to outnumber M\u0101ori and the colonial government's Native Land Purchase Department adopted unscrupulous methods to take ownership, which included offers to chiefs or small groups of owners. Deals with individual M\u0101ori or groups that did not represent majority interests also dragged M\u0101ori into disputes with one another.

A faction of moderates within the movement swung the decision against direct involvement, but news of the meetings led to panic in Auckland over the possibility of a M\u0101ori attack on the capital, in turn prompting what Dalton described as \"a mood of savage vindictiveness towards all M\u0101ori\".<ref name=\"DaltonWarPolitics\" />{{rp|110\u2013112}} In late June 1860 large numbers of Waikato M\u0101ori travelled to Taranaki to reinforce Te \u0100ti Awa chief [[Wiremu K\u012bngi]]'s forces and joined in the plunder of abandoned farms, but the intervention was unorganised and on a limited scale, relieving Taranaki settlers of some fear of full-scale K\u012bngitanga involvement.<ref name=\"DaltonWarPolitics\" />\n\nP\u014dtatau died of influenza on 25 June 1860 and was succeeded by his son, [[T\u0101whiao|Matutaera T\u0101whiao]].\n\n===Matutaera T\u0101whiao===\n{{main|T\u0101whiao}}\n[[File:TawhiaoNLA.jpg|thumb|175px|[[King Tawhiao|T\u0101whiao]], the second M\u0101ori King (1860\u20131894)]]\nT\u0101whiao's succession to the position of King coincided with a period of increasing friction between M\u0101ori and the Auckland-based settler government over issues of land ownership and sovereignty.

While M\u0101ori cultivated small areas, relying on extensive forests for berry, birds and roots, settlers expanded their production capacity by burning forest and fern and planting grass seed in the ashes. Some influential chiefs including [[Te Rauparaha]] opposed land sales in the 1840s (culminating in the 1843 [[Wairau Affray]]), and the view became more widespread in the following decade, when the [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] (European) population grew to outnumber M\u0101ori and the colonial government's Native Land Purchase Department adopted unscrupulous methods to take ownership, which included offers to chiefs or small groups of owners. Deals with individual M\u0101ori or groups that did not represent majority interests also dragged M\u0101ori into disputes with one another.

Discussions at that meeting, and at a second meeting at Peria six weeks later that attracted a large group of supporters from the lower Waikato, centered on hostilities in Taranaki and the question of whether the King Movement should intervene. A faction of moderates within the movement swung the decision against direct involvement, but news of the meetings led to panic in Auckland over the possibility of a M\u0101ori attack on the capital, in turn prompting what Dalton described as \"a mood of savage vindictiveness towards all M\u0101ori\".<ref name=\"DaltonWarPolitics\" />{{rp|110\u2013112}} In late June 1860 large numbers of Waikato M\u0101ori travelled to Taranaki to reinforce Te \u0100ti Awa chief [[Wiremu K\u012bngi]]'s forces and joined in the plunder of abandoned farms, but the intervention was unorganised and on a limited scale, relieving Taranaki settlers of some fear of full-scale K\u012bngitanga involvement.<ref name=\"DaltonWarPolitics\" />\n\nP\u014dtatau died of influenza on 25 June 1860 and was succeeded by his son, [[T\u0101whiao|Matutaera T\u0101whiao]].\n\n===Matutaera T\u0101whiao===\n{{main|T\u0101whiao}}\n[[File:TawhiaoNLA.jpg|thumb|175px|[[King Tawhiao|T\u0101whiao]], the second M\u0101ori King (1860\u20131894)]]\nT\u0101whiao's succession to the position of King coincided with a period of increasing friction between M\u0101ori and the Auckland-based settler government over issues of land ownership and sovereignty. Hostilities surrounding land purchases in Taranaki spread, erupting into a series of conflicts that became known as the [[New Zealand Wars]].\n\nTamihana, a strategist revered as the \"kingmaker\", expressed the K\u012bngitanga movement's key concern in a letter to Browne at the close of the [[First Taranaki War]] in 1861.

With strong support from his cousin and protector Te Puea (later widely referred to as \"Princess Te Puea\"), he withstood a challenge to his authority by Taingakawa, who established a rival ''kauhanganui'' (assembly) at Rukumoana, near [[Morrinsville]].

Te Puea explained: \"They tell us to fight for king and country. We've got a King, but we haven't got a country.

On 11 July 1918 police arrived at Te Paina, the King Movement's p\u0101 at Mangatawhiri, and began arresting males who had failed to report for military duty. The men were transported to Narrow Neck army training camp in Auckland, where they were repeatedly punished for refusing to dress in military uniform. At the end of the war 111 remained in confinement; they were released in May 1919. The anti-conscription stance led to the K\u012bngitanga Movement being widely regarded by P\u0101keh\u0101 as seditious traitors and German sympathisers and also drove a wedge between Te Puea and Pomare, who throughout the war urged all M\u0101ori to fight for empire forces.<ref name=\"KingTePuea\" />{{rp|80\u201396}}\n\nTe Puea continued to strengthen her position as an organiser and spiritual leader.

The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss' 108th birthday.\n\nThe second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the book (following the [[The Lorax (TV special)|1972 animated television special]]), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler and [[Zac Efron]] as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey, Ted's love interest (voiced by [[Taylor Swift]]), Aloysius O'Hare ([[Rob Riggle]]), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother ([[Jenny Slate]]), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother ([[Betty White]]).<ref name=\"The Lorax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/813236/Dr-Seuss-The-Lorax/full-credits.html|title=The Lorax|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[walled city]] where everything is artificial, with no living plants (\"Thneedville\"). Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a \u201creal tree\u201d. His Grammy Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. Returning home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled [[oxygen]] to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.\n\nThe Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees (\"This is The Place\"). Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who \u201cspeaks for the trees\u201d. After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinces him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the \u201cThneed\u201d, a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success (\"Everybody Needs a Thneed\"). His lazy relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but deforestation and pollution (\"How Bad Can I Be?\"). After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a [[recluse]]. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live and disappeared into the sky, leaving a single word on a pile of rocks: \"Unless\".\n\nThe Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare\u2019s city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O\u2019Hare to the center of town. O\u2019Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an [[earthmover]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted\u2019s conviction, the crowd turns on O\u2019Hare, and the seed is finally planted (\"Let It Grow\"). Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax.\n\nThe film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as The Lorax, a mystical orange furry creature with a yellow moustache.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{cite web|title=First look: Danny DeVito will stump for trees in 3-D 'Lorax'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|author=Breznican, Anthony|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173755/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Ed Helms]] as The Once-ler.<ref name=\"FirstLook\" />\n*[[Zac Efron]] as Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy.<ref name=ETOSharletteLorax>{{cite news|author=Sharlette|title=CINEMA WITH SHARLETTE: 'THE LORAX'|url=http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|accessdate=June 15, 2013|newspaper=ETonline.com|date=March 5, 2012|quote=In the 3D-CG version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, we focus on Ted Wiggins, a 12-year-old boy in search of a living tree for the girl he adores.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016030035/http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|archivedate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> He is named after the author of the book, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel).<ref name=\"Collider20120130\">{{cite news|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=10 Things to Know About DR.

Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells them not to have [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]]. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a Truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its [[wheel]]s, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off\u2014only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled \"Grr\" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.\n\n;''Forces of Nature''\nThe Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it is fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff up. When the Lorax tells Pipsqueak that he is going to turn out like him, Pipsqueak gets scared and runs away. The short ends with the Lorax telling Pipsqueak that he has lost his Honorary Lorax title.\n\n===Video game===\n[[Blockdot]] created a mobile puzzle game based on the film, titled ''Truffula Shuffula''.

lines that is from the book, that does have Dr. Seuss' sublime whimsy, is basically made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.}}\n\nThe film also garnered some positive reviews from critics such as [[Richard Roeper]], who called it a \"solid piece of family entertainment\".<ref name=\"richroeper\">{{cite web|last=Roeper|first=Richard|title=Dr. Seuss' The Lorax

The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss' 108th birthday.\n\nThe second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the book (following the [[The Lorax (TV special)|1972 animated television special]]), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler and [[Zac Efron]] as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey, Ted's love interest (voiced by [[Taylor Swift]]), Aloysius O'Hare ([[Rob Riggle]]), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother ([[Jenny Slate]]), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother ([[Betty White]]).<ref name=\"The Lorax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/813236/Dr-Seuss-The-Lorax/full-credits.html|title=The Lorax|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[walled city]] where everything is artificial, with no living plants (\"Thneedville\"). Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a \u201creal tree\u201d. His Grammy Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. Returning home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled [[oxygen]] to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.\n\nThe Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees (\"This is The Place\"). Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who \u201cspeaks for the trees\u201d. After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinces him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the \u201cThneed\u201d, a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success (\"Everybody Needs a Thneed\"). His lazy relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but deforestation and pollution (\"How Bad Can I Be?\"). After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a [[recluse]]. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live and disappeared into the sky, leaving a single word on a pile of rocks: \"Unless\".\n\nThe Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare\u2019s city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O\u2019Hare to the center of town. O\u2019Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an [[earthmover]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted\u2019s conviction, the crowd turns on O\u2019Hare, and the seed is finally planted (\"Let It Grow\"). Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax. The film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as The Lorax, a mystical orange furry creature with a yellow moustache.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{cite web|title=First look: Danny DeVito will stump for trees in 3-D 'Lorax'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|author=Breznican, Anthony|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173755/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Ed Helms]] as The Once-ler.<ref name=\"FirstLook\" />\n*[[Zac Efron]] as Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy.<ref name=ETOSharletteLorax>{{cite news|author=Sharlette|title=CINEMA WITH SHARLETTE: 'THE LORAX'|url=http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|accessdate=June 15, 2013|newspaper=ETonline.com|date=March 5, 2012|quote=In the 3D-CG version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, we focus on Ted Wiggins, a 12-year-old boy in search of a living tree for the girl he adores.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016030035/http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|archivedate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> He is named after the author of the book, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel).<ref name=\"Collider20120130\">{{cite news|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=10 Things to Know About DR.

Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells them not to have [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]]. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a Truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its [[wheel]]s, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off\u2014only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled \"Grr\" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.\n\n;''Forces of Nature''\nThe Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it is fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff up. When the Lorax tells Pipsqueak that he is going to turn out like him, Pipsqueak gets scared and runs away. The short ends with the Lorax telling Pipsqueak that he has lost his Honorary Lorax title.\n\n===Video game===\n[[Blockdot]] created a mobile puzzle game based on the film, titled ''Truffula Shuffula''.

The town is bordered by the [[Piako River]] to the east and the [[Waitakaruru Stream]] to the south.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History and Culture==\n\n===Pre-European settlement===\n\nPrior to European settlement of New Zealand, the hills around present-day Morrinsville were occupied  by the Ngati Werewere [[M\u0101ori people]] of the Ngati Haua [[Iwi]], and the site of the present-day town was on or near to an old M\u0101ori route between the upper Waihou-Piako basin and the [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]] area.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_2\"/>\n\nFollowing European settlement, some early European [[Merchant|traders]] are believed to have traversed this route prior to 1834 when the Rev. J. Morgan travelled up the [[Piako River]] to near the future town site and crossed west to Horotiu, near Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_1\"/> First recorded contact with European settlers occurred around 1850, with John Johnson trading with the M\u0101ori from 1852.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_3\"/>\n\n===Post-European settlement===\n\nThe 1860s saw an influx of European settlers to the area between [[Te Aroha]] and [[Matamata]], and on 13 December 1873 a settler from [[Auckland]], Thomas  Morrin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3016/object/520|title=Land Title; 1876; 7042 - Morrinsville Museum on NZMuseums|website=www.nzmuseums.co.nz|access-date=2016-03-02}}</ref> purchased the Kuranui No.1 Block from the local M\u0101ori and founded the Lockerbie Estate, which Morrin named after the [[Lockerbie|Scottish town]] from which his father emigrated. In May 1874, Morrin purchased two further blocks,  Motumaoho No.1 and No.2, and his estate then totaled over {{convert|30,000|acre|hectare}}. The fledgling village was to be the service centre for Morrin's Lockerbie Estate and he built a blacksmith's shop, manager's house, the Jolly Cripple Hotel and general store and donated land for a school. Morrin hired Irish [[navvy|navvies]] from the gold fields to dig a network of ditches to drain the land, enabling it to be used for agriculture. In 1882 Morrin surveyed the land for the site of the town proper, and deposited plans for ten streets:  Anderson, Hamilton, Studholme, Moorhouse, Lorne, Canada, Cureton, Somerville, Thames and Thorpe (the first and last three streets being named after family members).<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_2\"/><ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_1\"/><ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_3\"/>\n\n[[File:Lockerbie Estate Blacksmiths Morrinsville.jpg|thumb|Lockerbie Estate Blacksmiths in Studholme Street, Morrinsville, circa 1890]]\n\nThe Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company began construction of a railway line from Morrinsville to [[Rotorua]] in 1879, and on 1 October 1884, the line from [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] to Morrinsville was opened. With construction progressing towards [[Paeroa]] and the line to [[Te Aroha]] opening on 1 March 1886, the town's population was listed as 633 people.<ref>{{cite

processing has been a notable industry in Morrinsville, most notably through the Morrinsville Dairy Company since 1922.  The dairy company retained the Scottish link through prominently using the name Lockerbie. Today, after a series of mergers, the dairy factory is now operated by the [[Fonterra]] Dairy Co-operative. The factory processes 1.2 million litres of milk per day during the peak of the milk production season, producing milk powders, cream, butter and canned butter for tropical countries where refrigeration is not always available.\n\nDuring the late 1920s a company was formed to develop the flax industry on the extensive low-lying areas west of Morrinsville. Several thousand acres were acquired for the planting and milling of [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax)]], but prevailing  economic conditions forced the early abandonment of the project.  Most of this land has reverted to dairy farming or fat-lamb production, and the original English grasses used by earlier settlers have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. During the town's formative years the area also contained a number of commercial sawmills, most of which closed by the 1930s as land was cleared for farming. Meadow Mushrooms, one of Morrinsville's biggest employers, ceased its local operations and relocated to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] in 2010, with the subsequent loss of around 160 jobs.<ref name=\"NZHeradNews\"/>\n\nAs a service centre for the local dairy industry, many of Morrinsville's businesses are geared towards supporting this industry and associated rural activities, and today the town is still home to large stockyards and regular livestock markets.  There is also a chemical plant producing hydrogen peroxide, fertiliser and other agri-nutrients located on the southern outskirts of the town.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Chart_of_Morrinsville_railway_station_ticket_sales_1885-1950.jpg|thumb|tickets sales 1885-1950 - derived from annual returns to Parliament of \"Statement of Revenue for each Station for the Year ended\"]]\nHistorically, Morrinsville was the railway junction of the Auckland\u2013Thames and Auckland\u2013Rotorua lines, which subsequently became the [[Thames Branch]] and the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] ([[Tauranga]]) lines.  Morrinsville Railway Station was opened on 1 October 1884, to the east off Studholme Street, at the junction of the two lines. A footbridge over the track was opened in 1913, connecting the station with the town from the end of Canada Street.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_6\"/> The station was described as consisting of \"two asphalt passenger platforms, and the station buildings contain a ladies' waiting room, a large general waiting room, a post office lobby with post and telegraph offices, a ticket office, and offices for the Inspector of Permanent Way. There are also large goods and engine sheds, and cattle loading yards. Five workmen's cottages adjoin the station, and the Bank of New Zealand Estates Company has a large building connected with the siding for seed-cleaning and storage purposes.\"<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_5\"/> The station was moved about {{Convert|1/4|mi||abbr=}} towards Hamilton in 1923.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIKIN19230927.2.8|title=LOCAL AND GENERAL.

The [[Thames Branch]] closed on 28 June 1991 and the track subsequently lifted, although in 2004 a short shunt line \u2013 the Waitoa Industrial Line \u2013 reopened to facilitate freight trains for the Waitoa Dairy Factory. The [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] provided passenger services between [[Auckland]] and [[Rotorua]] \u2013 the [[Geyserland Express]] \u2013 and [[Auckland]] and [[Tauranga]] - the [[Kaimai Express]]; however, in 2001 it was announced that these services were too uneconomic to continue, and the last trains ran on 7 October 2001.\n\nPassenger traffic reached a peak in 1944, as shown in this table and the graph -\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|year\n|tickets\n|season tickets\n|staff\n|source\n|titte\n|-\n|1885\n|1,652\n|3\n|3\n|<nowiki>https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/appendix-to-the-journals-of-the-house-of-representatives/1885/I/1156</nowiki>\n|RETURN No. 10.

[[town]] in the [[Waikato]] region of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]], with a population of approximately 7,000 in the 2013 Census.<ref name=\"Census2013\"/> The town is located at the northern base of the Pakaroa Range, and on the south-western fringe of the [[Hauraki Plains]].  Morrinsville is around 33 kilometres east of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and 22 kilometres west of [[Te Aroha]]. The town is bordered by the [[Piako River]] to the east and the [[Waitakaruru Stream]] to the south.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History and Culture==\n\n===Pre-European settlement===\n\nPrior to European settlement of New Zealand, the hills around present-day Morrinsville were occupied  by the Ngati Werewere [[M\u0101ori people]] of the Ngati Haua [[Iwi]], and the site of the present-day town was on or near to an old M\u0101ori route between the upper Waihou-Piako basin and the [[Ngaruawahia]] area.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_2\"/>\n\nFollowing European settlement, some early European [[Merchant|traders]] are believed to have traversed this route prior to 1834 when the Rev. J. Morgan travelled up the [[Piako River]] to near the future town site and crossed west to Horotiu, near Ngaruawahia.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_1\"/> First recorded contact with European settlers occurred around 1850, with John Johnson trading with the M\u0101ori from 1852.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_3\"/>\n\n===Post-European settlement===\n\nThe 1860s saw an influx of European settlers to the area between [[Te Aroha]] and [[Matamata]], and on 13 December 1873 a settler from [[Auckland]], Thomas  Morrin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3016/object/520|title=Land Title; 1876; 7042 - Morrinsville Museum on NZMuseums|website=www.nzmuseums.co.nz|access-date=2016-03-02}}</ref> purchased the Kuranui \u21161 Block from the local M\u0101ori and founded the Lockerbie Estate, which Morrin named after the [[Lockerbie|Scottish town]] from which his father emigrated. In May 1874, Morrin purchased two further blocks,  Motumaoho \u21161 and \u21162, and his estate then totaled over {{convert|30,000|acre|hectare}}. The fledgling village was to be the service centre for Morrin\u2019s Lockerbie Estate and he built a blacksmith's shop, manager's house, the Jolly Cripple Hotel and general store and donated land for a school. Morrin hired Irish [[navvy|navvies]] from the gold fields to dig a network of ditches to drain the land, enabling it to be used for agriculture. In 1882 Morrin surveyed the land for the site of the town proper, and deposited plans for ten streets:  Anderson, Hamilton, Studholme, Moorhouse, Lorne, Canada, Cureton, Somerville, Thames and Thorpe (the first and last three streets being named after family members).<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_2\"/><ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_1\"/><ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_3\"/>\n\n[[File:Lockerbie Estate Blacksmiths Morrinsville.jpg|thumb|Lockerbie Estate Blacksmiths in Studholme Street, Morrinsville, circa 1890]]\n\nThe Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company began construction of a railway line from Morrinsville to [[Rotorua]] in 1879, and on 1 October 1884, the line from [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] to Morrinsville was opened. With construction progressing towards [[Paeroa]] and the line to [[Te Aroha]] opening on 1 March 1886, the town's population was listed as 633 people.<ref>{{cite

[[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] and [[Tauranga]], alongside extensive drainage of swamp land to the south and west of the town making available large areas for dairy farming, Morrinsville was declared a town district in 1908 and in 1921 was constituted as a borough.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_1\"/>\n\n===Marae===\n\nMorrinsville has two [[marae]]: Kai a Te Mata and its meeting house Wairere,

processing has been a notable industry in Morrinsville, most notably through the Morrinsville Dairy Company since 1922.  The dairy company retained the Scottish link through prominently using the name Lockerbie. Today, after a series of mergers, the dairy factory is now operated by the [[Fonterra]] Dairy Co-operative. The factory processes 1.2 million litres of milk per day during the peak of the milk production season, producing milk powders, cream, butter and canned butter for tropical countries where refrigeration is not always available.\n\nDuring the late 1920s a company was formed to develop the flax industry on the extensive low-lying areas west of Morrinsville. Several thousand acres were acquired for the planting and milling of [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax)]], but prevailing  economic conditions forced the early abandonment of the project.  Most of this land has reverted to dairy farming or fat-lamb production, and the original English grasses used by earlier settlers have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. During the town's formative years the area also contained a number of commercial sawmills, most of which closed by the 1930s as land was cleared for farming. Meadow Mushrooms, one of Morrinsville's biggest employers, ceased its local operations and relocated to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] in 2010, with the subsequent loss of around 160 jobs.<ref name=\"NZHeradNews\"/>\n\nAs a service centre for the local dairy industry, many of Morrinsville's businesses are geared towards supporting this industry and associated rural activities, and today the town is still home to large stockyards and regular livestock markets.  There is also a chemical plant producing hydrogen peroxide, fertiliser and other agri-nutrients located on the southern outskirts of the town.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Chart_of_Morrinsville_railway_station_ticket_sales_1885-1950.jpg|thumb|tickets sales 1885-1950 - derived from annual returns to Parliament of \"Statement of Revenue for each Station for the Year ended\"]]\nHistorically, Morrinsville was the railway junction of the Auckland\u2013Thames and Auckland\u2013Rotorua lines, which subsequently became the [[Thames Branch]] and the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] ([[Tauranga]]) lines.  Morrinsville Railway Station was opened on 1 October 1884, to the east off Studholme Street, at the junction of the two lines. A footbridge over the track was opened in 1913, connecting the station with the town from the end of Canada Street.<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_6\"/> The station was described as consisting of \"two asphalt passenger platforms, and the station buildings contain a ladies' waiting room, a large general waiting room, a post office lobby with post and telegraph offices, a ticket office, and offices for the Inspector of Permanent Way. There are also large goods and engine sheds, and cattle loading yards. Five workmen's cottages adjoin the station, and the Bank of New Zealand Estates Company has a large building connected with the siding for seed-cleaning and storage purposes.\"<ref name=\"MorrinsvilleHistory_5\"/> The station was moved about {{Convert|1/4|mi||abbr=}} towards Hamilton in 1923.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIKIN19230927.2.8|title=LOCAL AND GENERAL.

The [[Thames Branch]] closed on 28 June 1991 and the track subsequently lifted, although in 2004 a short shunt line \u2013 the Waitoa Industrial Line \u2013 reopened to facilitate freight trains for the Waitoa Dairy Factory. The [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] provided passenger services between [[Auckland]] and [[Rotorua]] \u2013 the [[Geyserland Express]] \u2013 and [[Auckland]] and [[Tauranga]] - the [[Kaimai Express]]; however, in 2001 it was announced that these services were too uneconomic to continue, and the last trains ran on 7 October 2001.\n\nPassenger traffic reached a peak in 1944, as shown in this table and the graph -\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|year\n|tickets\n|season tickets\n|staff\n|source\n|titte\n|-\n|1885\n|1,652\n|3\n|3\n|<nowiki>https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/appendix-to-the-journals-of-the-house-of-representatives/1885/I/1156</nowiki>\n|RETURN No. 10.
