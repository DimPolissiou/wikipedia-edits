The first episode that aired on GSN was a representative episode of the oldest series in their archives, a What's My Line? episode from March 8, 1953 featuring Jackie Gleason. ''Match Game'' took the regular 7 PM time slot the next day.}} From 1994 until about 1997, the network aired classic pre-1972 game shows as well as game shows made after 1972, most of which came from the [[Mark Goodson]]\u2013[[Bill Todman]] library. The network also used to air live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company [[Sony]]. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package, a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball), and a new slogan: \"All Play, All Day\". The network's new promos and new idents were designed by graphics agency Lee Hunt Associates.\n\nOn October 11, 1997, the network's rights to the Goodson-Todman library expired, with the exceptions of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and the 1994\u201395 season of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (the only season in the second [[Richard Dawson]] era), which were both allowed to continue airing on the channel on a separate contract. This period lasted until April 18, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/GSN|website=[[TV Tropes]]|title=Awesome/GSN |accessdate=2020-03-07}}</ref> With the other Goodson-Todman shows gone, lesser-known Sony properties such as ''[[Juvenile Jury]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', the 1976\u201377 version of ''[[Break the Bank (1976 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', and the [[Bill Cullen]]-hosted games ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'' and ''[[Pass the Buck (American game show)|Pass the Buck]]'' all found their way onto the schedule. Shows from [[Chuck Barris]] also aired during this time, including ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]''.\n\nGame Show Network aired a children's game show block at this time, featuring ''Joker! Joker! Joker!'', ''[[Jep!]]'', and ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' \u2013 the respective adaptations of ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.\n\n===1998\u20132004===\nOn April 18, 1998, Game Show Network bought back the rights to the Goodson-Todman library. In late 1998, GSN eliminated all of its live programming, replacing them with in-show advertisements like ''Win TV''. In 1999, the network began a slate of original programming, including ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]''. The channel also launched original shows such as ''Extreme Gong'' (a remake of the classic ''[[The Gong Show]]''). In 2000, the network lost the rights to ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', with the last episode airing on April 3 of that year.\n\nIn 2001, a massive change in both leadership and programming at the network took place when [[Liberty Media]] acquired a 50% stake. Both president Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber departed and former [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] president Rich Cronin was hired to head the network.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Umstead|first1=R.

The All-New Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'', ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]'', ''[[WinTuition]]'', and ''[[Cram (game show)|Cram]]''. In the Fall of 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' but, due to pressure from CBS, the [[Michael Larson]] episodes were initially excluded. CBS eventually gave Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with an original documentary called ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal''.\n\nIn the Fall of 2003, Game Show Network picked up the rights to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' with [[Regis Philbin]]. In December of that year, the network began airing ''[[GSN Video Games]]''; the first program to air on the network that was unrelated to traditional game show formats.\n\n===2004\u20132018: GSN===\nOn March 15, 2004, Game Show Network began using the abbreviation \"GSN\" and introduced the tagline \"The Network for Games\", a move in line with the network expanding its programming to include the genre of [[reality television]] and various other competitions. GSN also introduced the original series at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, ''[[World Series of Blackjack]]'', ''National Lampoon's Greek Games'', ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'' (a Canadian import), and the short-lived ''Fake-a-Date'', a find-a-mate program with host Evan Marriott, the original Joe Millionaire.

In the channel's early days, GSN aired a three-hour block called ''Club A.M.'', consisting of five classic game shows, surrounded by thirty minutes' worth of interstitial trivia, interviews with game show producers, personalities, contestants and fans, and interactive call-in games, all hosted by Laura Chambers and Steve Day (which was also rerun in late night, with some new segments, under the title ''Late Night Games''). ''[[Prime Games]]'' was a similarly formatted show aired weeknights and hosted by [[Peter Tomarken]]. ''Wide World of Games'' was a Saturday night block of four shows built around a common theme.\n\nAfter a few years, these shows were replaced by ''Game TV'' (a half-hour interview show hosted by Nancy Sullivan and Dave Nemeth), ''Game World'' (which showed highlights of current game shows from around the world), and standalone 30-minute call-in games like ''Super Decades'' and ''Trivia Track''. Later, the channel attempted a ''Gong Show'' remake called ''Extreme Gong'' (hosted by [[George Gray (television personality)|George Gray]], in which the viewers could phone in their votes as to whether to \"gong\" acts off the air) and ''Throut And Neck'' (hosted by [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]])<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEkZvm8vZ1Y|title=Throut & Neck - Canadia Episode - Part 1|date=10 June 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297650/|title=Throut and Neck (TV Series 1999\u2013 )|author=thewatcheruatu|date=25 May 2004|work=IMDb}}</ref> (where viewers controlled video game characters with their phones). All these efforts were eventually canceled and removed from the network's schedule.\n\nTraditional game shows offered in this time included ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]'', ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', ''[[Mall Masters]]'', ''[[Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' (a game based on the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Friend or Foe?|Prisoner's Dilemma]]), ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[WinTuition]]'', ''[[Cram (game show)|Cram]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Funny Money]]'', and ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]'' (a [[Chuck Woolery]]-hosted revival of the 1987\u201388 Canadian format in which teams guess five-letter words in a combination of [[Jotto]]/[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]] and [[Bingo (US)|bingo]]). The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOriginals debuting in 2006 included ''[[PlayMania]]'', a late night call-in game that expanded from two to (at one point) six nights a week continuing until October 31, 2007, and a revival of ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', which ended its run on June 9, 2007. ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]'', ''[[Starface]]'', and a revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' also debuted in 2006. Debuting in July 2007 were ''[[Camouflage (2007 game show)|Camouflage]]'', remade as a word game, and ''[[Without Prejudice?]]'', a remake of a British show where five people decide which contestant would win $25,000 based in part on their responses to questioning. Debuting on August 4, 2007 was ''[[Grand Slam (American game show)|Grand Slam]]'', a game show involving big winners from other shows, including [[Ken Jennings]], [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], and [[Brad Rutter]].\n\nFor 2008, a U.S. version of a [[BBC]] game show called ''[[How Much Is Enough?]]'' debuted on January 8, 2008, hosted by [[Corbin Bernsen]], and then on March 31, 2008, ''[[Bingo America]]'' made its debut with [[Patrick Duffy]] as host. On July 21, 2008, as something of a tie-in with the movie ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', Merrill Heatter returned to game-show producing with ''[[Catch 21]]'' (a revival of the 1970s game ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'') hosted by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] with [[Mikki Padilla]] as the dealer. GSN also relaunched a live interactive call-in interstitial series, this time known as ''[[GSN Live]]'', which aired during commercial breaks between Noon and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday. Originally the series took place over a three-hour span, with [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Heidi Bohay]] hosting the interstitial segments. Later in the year GSN expanded the series to six hours, with Roggin moving to the 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. block with [[Kelly Packard]] while Alfonso Ribeiro replaced him earlier in the day. Packard was forced to leave her position shortly after taking it, and Roggin hosted with a guest host until May 15, 2009 when [[Debra Wilson|Debra Skelton]] was chosen to be a permanent co-host as of May 26, 2009. Roggin left GSN Live on July 2, 2009 in order to concentrate on his new game show ''[[The Money List]]''. Alfonso left GSN Live on August 11, 2009 in order to concentrate on hosting ''[[Catch 21]]''. ''GSN Live'' itself ended on July 29, 2011.\n\nAlso in 2009, ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' returned to the air on GSN, this time with [[Carnie Wilson]] as host. On June 13, 2009, GSN premiered its ''Big Saturday Night'' live interactive show block, hosted by [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Ross Matthews]] and [[Charissa Thompson]]. The three-hour block features a variety of games, such as identifying pictures. Included in the block are ''[[20Q (game show)|20Q]]'', hosted by [[Cat Deeley]] and featuring the voice of [[Hal Sparks]] as \"Mr. Q\", and ''[[The Money List]]'', hosted by [[Fred Roggin]]. A hidden camera series, ''[[Instant Recall]]'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], premiered on March 4, 2010.<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web| last = Sassone| first = Bob| url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/02/04/wink-martindale-to-host-instant-recall-on-gsn-starting-march-4/| title = Wink Martindale to Host 'Instant Recall' on GSN Starting March 4| publisher = [[TV Squad]] ([[AOL]])| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref><ref name=\"buzzerblog\">{{cite web |url=http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/gsn-revives-1-vs-100/ |title=GSN Revives 1 vs. 100 |website=Buzzerblog |accessdate=2010-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817182536/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/gsn-revives-1-vs-100/ |archivedate=2010-08-17}}</ref> A revival of ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', hosted by [[Carrie Ann Inaba]], aired in 2010.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, Game Show Network announced that Drew Carey would host a new [[improvisational comedy]] show entitled ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]'' in the Spring of 2011 on April 11, 2011. The shows were filmed at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas in January and February 2011. The show lasted forty episodes before being canceled due to low ratings.\n\nIn August 23, 2012, ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]'' with [[Jeff Foxworthy]] became the channel's most popular program of all time, with the series premiere being watched by two million viewers. In the fall of 2012, GSN premiered a new revival titled ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The Pyramid]]'', with [[Mike Richards (producer)|Mike Richards]] hosting. GSN debuted an [[The Chase (American game show)|American version]] of the UK game show ''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]'' on August 6, 2013, hosted by [[Brooke Burns]] and featuring [[Mark Labbett]], one of the \"Chasers\" on the UK version, as the sole \"Chaser\", known as \"the Beast\". The show received a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]] in 2014, and Burns received a nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] two years later. In the summer of 2014, GSN debuted new series such as ''[[It Takes a Church]]'', ''[[Skin Wars]]'', and ''[[Idiotest]]''.\n\nGSN premiered the original series ''[[America Says]]'', hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] on June 18, 2018, and the video clip game show ''[[Caroline & Friends]]'', hosted by actress [[Caroline Rhea]] on July 16, 2018. On March 21, 2019, GSN announced it would revive ''[[Catch 21]]'', featuring a different format with Ribeiro returning as host. The network also announced a new show, ''[[Best Ever Trivia Show]]'' with [[Sherri Shepherd]] as the host. The show debuted on June 10, 2019. GSN continued to introduce new originals, with ''[[Common Knowledge (game show)|Common Knowledge]]'' hosted by [[Joey Fatone]] debuting on January 14, 2019, the reboot of ''[[Catch 21]]'' with new dealer [[Witney Carson]] debuting on October 14, 2019, and ''[[Get a Clue (game show)|Get a Clue]]'' hosted by [[Robert Belushi]] premiering on January 6, 2020.\n\n====Specials====\nThe network has run blocks of classic game shows on Saturday nights, and for the first few months of 2006 programmed back-to-back episodes of ''[[Match Game]]'' in a block billed as ''That '70s Hour'' (a pun on ''[[That '70s Show]]''), which showed the original [[clapperboard|production slate]] before each episode as well as ''Match Game'' trivia and brief clips of an interview with host [[Gene Rayburn]] produced shortly before his death. Although production slates had been aired by the network prior to this, \"That '70s Hour\" was the first time the network ''intentionally'' did so. During the Summer of 2006, the network began a special seven-week run of ''The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time''.\n\nIn November 2006, GSN started a series of eight documentaries hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]], each about game shows, beginning with a program on ''Match Game'' titled ''Behind The Blank''. Other subjects included game show producer [[Chuck Barris]], ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'', a \"Top Ten\" countdown of game show hosts, memorable game show moments, women who have featured prominently on game shows, celebrities and how they impacted game shows, and an insider's guide to winning on a game show.\n\nOne particularly interesting subject was the installments of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' in which [[Michael Larson]] won more than $100,000 in cash and prizes by memorizing the sequences of the board then used, which was the subject of ''Big Bucks: The \"Press Your Luck\" Scandal''. Peter Tomarken, who had hosted ''Press Your Luck'', hosted and narrated this documentary in 2003. The documentary became Game Show Network's most watched show ever at the time scoring a 1.7 at one point during the show. Originally, CBS, the original broadcaster of ''Press Your Luck'', did not want GSN to air the Larson episodes. However, this angered many fans, causing CBS to allow Game Show Network to air the episodes as part of the documentary as well as standalone episodes.\n\nIn 2007, the network debuted two new specials: the ''[[National Vocabulary Championship]]'', with a show airing on April 15, 2007 showcasing the first year of the event, and a broadcast of the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] International Cat Show, ''Catminster''. In November 2008, GSN and [[Meow Mix]] presented a special entitled ''[[Think Like a Cat]]'', hosted by Chuck Woolery, with a top prize of $1 million, one of the few times a game show on cable television has had that amount as a grand prize. On December 16, 2014, GSN aired a special called ''Game Show Flashback'', hosted by Ben Gleib, which featured some of the best moments in game show history. GSN aired a 2-hour special called ''[[The Line (game show)|The Line]]'' on December 23, 2014, which was hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. On January 1, 2015, in preparation for the revival of ''[[Baggage (American game show)|Baggage]]'' entitled ''[[Baggage on the Road]]'', GSN aired a special called ''Baggage: Most Outrageous Moments'' hosted by Jerry Springer.\n\n===Acquired programming===\nGSN's acquired programming comes primarily from [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], with acquired programming also coming from [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], and [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. During the time that Liberty Media and successors DirecTV and AT&T had a stake in the channel from 2001 to 2019, GSN had had to pay a licensing fee to air game shows owned by founding parent company [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] subsidiary [[Columbia TriStar Television]].  Before that time period and again since Sony regained 100% ownership in November 2019, GSN has unlimited free access to the game shows owned by what is now Sony Pictures Television.\n\nFrom Fremantle, the network licenses ''[[Match Game]]'' (Rayburn), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (Harvey). GSN had licensed the entire [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] library from its inception until March 2009 and has in the past also licensed ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Sale of the Century (American game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (other Fremantle properties) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel [[Buzzr]], a digital subchannel network over which Fremantle has sole programming control.\n\nIn the network's infancy, GSN regularly showcased vintage Goodson-Todman game and panel shows from the 1950s and 1960s, many of which were either originally broadcast or only preserved in [[black-and-white]] \u2013 such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. These classic shows made up much of the channel's lineup at the outset, but have been gradually cut back in prominence since the late 1990s. On October 1, 2006, only ''What's My Line?'' had a regular spot on the schedule, late Sunday/early Monday at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, it was followed by a selection from various 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Goodson-Todman shows, usually another panel game. On December 19, 2006, GSN reinstated the ''Black and White Overnight'' to seven days a week from 3:00&nbsp;a.m. to 4:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, showcasing ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' in the block, other shows, including ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[The Name's the Same]]'', and the Bud Collyer-hosted primetime version of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' have been featured, this run ended March 31, 2009. ''Black and White Overnight'' has returned for two weeks in December since 2009, featuring ''What's My Line?'' and ''I've Got a Secret''.\n\nOver the years, GSN, in addition to its Goodson-Todman library, featured game shows from other studios:\n* [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]: ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' (2000), ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Dog Eat Dog (American game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (American game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[Minute to Win It]]''\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1998 version only)\n* [[MGM Television|MGM Domestic Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1966 version only), ''[[Cash Cab (American game show)|Cash Cab]]''\n* [[Warner Bros.

(from [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], both the network and syndicated versions) and have added more episodes since, including the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off from 2004; the show was off the schedule from November 2012 to December 2017, when repeats of the Chris Harrison episodes were added to the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/GSN-Adds-WHO-WANTS-TO-BE-A-MILLIONAIRE-to-Daytime-Schedule-1218-20171204|title=GSN Adds WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE to Daytime Schedule, 12/18|author=TV News Desk|website=Broadway World}}</ref> Among the most well-known classic game shows previously aired regularly on the network include ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[Love Connection]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''.\n\n===High-definition feed===\nGame Show Network HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed of the channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format; it was launched on September 15, 2010 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|title=Game Show Network Press Release|access-date=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111325/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The HD feed is currently carried on most providers nationwide and in Canada.\n\n===GSN On Demand===\nGSN partnered with Vubiquity to launch GSN On Demand on August 15, 2013.

''Match Game'' took the regular 7 PM time slot the next day.}} From 1994 until about 1997, the network aired classic pre-1972 game shows as well as game shows made after 1972, most of which came from the [[Mark Goodson]]\u2013[[Bill Todman]] library. The network also used to air live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company [[Sony]]. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package, a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball), and a new slogan: \"All Play, All Day\". The network's new promos and new idents were designed by graphics agency Lee Hunt Associates.\n\nOn October 11, 1997, the network's rights to the Goodson-Todman library expired, with the exceptions of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and the 1994\u201395 season of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (the only season in the second [[Richard Dawson]] era), which were both allowed to continue airing on the channel on a separate contract.

Shows from [[Chuck Barris]] also aired during this time, including ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]''.\n\nGame Show Network aired a children's game show block at this time, featuring ''Joker!

In late 1998, GSN eliminated all of its live programming, replacing them with in-show advertisements like ''Win TV''. In 1999, the network began a slate of original programming, including ''[[Inquizition]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|All New 3's a Crowd]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]''. The channel also launched original shows such as ''Extreme Gong'' (a remake of the classic ''[[The Gong Show]]''). In 2000, the network lost the rights to ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', with the last episode airing on April 3 of that year.\n\nIn 2001, a massive change in both leadership and programming at the network took place when [[Liberty Media]] acquired a 50% stake.

In the Fall of 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' but, due to pressure from CBS, the [[Michael Larson]] episodes were initially excluded. CBS eventually gave Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with an original documentary called ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal''.\n\nIn the Fall of 2003, Game Show Network picked up the rights to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' with [[Regis Philbin]]. In December of that year, the network began airing ''[[GSN Video Games]]''; the first program to air on the network that was unrelated to traditional game show formats.\n\n===2004\u20132018: GSN===\nOn March 15, 2004, Game Show Network began using the abbreviation \"GSN\" and introduced the tagline \"The Network for Games\", a move in line with the network expanding its programming to include the genre of [[reality television]] and various other competitions. GSN also introduced the original series at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, ''[[World Series of Blackjack]]'', ''National Lampoon's Greek Games'', ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'' (a Canadian import), and the short-lived ''Fake-a-Date'', a find-a-mate program with host Evan Marriott, the original Joe Millionaire.

''[[Prime Games]]'' was a similarly formatted show aired weeknights and hosted by [[Peter Tomarken]]. ''Wide World of Games'' was a Saturday night block of four shows built around a common theme.\n\nAfter a few years, these shows were replaced by ''Game TV'' (a half-hour interview show hosted by Nancy Sullivan and Dave Nemeth), ''Game World'' (which showed highlights of current game shows from around the world), and standalone 30-minute call-in games like ''Super Decades'' and ''Trivia Track''. Later, the channel attempted a ''Gong Show'' remake called ''Extreme Gong'' (hosted by [[George Gray (television personality)|George Gray]], in which the viewers could phone in their votes as to whether to \"gong\" acts off the air) and ''Throut And Neck'' (hosted by [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]])<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEkZvm8vZ1Y|title=Throut & Neck - Canadia Episode - Part 1|date=10 June 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297650/|title=Throut and Neck (TV Series 1999\u2013 )|author=thewatcheruatu|date=25 May 2004|work=IMDb}}</ref> (where viewers controlled video game characters with their phones).

The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOriginals debuting in 2006 included ''[[PlayMania]]'', a late night call-in game that expanded from two to (at one point) six nights a week continuing until October 31, 2007, and a revival of ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', which ended its run on June 9, 2007. ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]'', ''[[Starface]]'', and a revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' also debuted in 2006. Debuting in July 2007 were ''[[Camouflage (2007 game show)|Camouflage]]'', remade as a word game, and ''[[Without Prejudice?]]'', a remake of a British show where five people decide which contestant would win $25,000 based in part on their responses to questioning. Debuting on August 4, 2007 was ''[[Grand Slam (American game show)|Grand Slam]]'', a game show involving big winners from other shows, including [[Ken Jennings]], [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], and [[Brad Rutter]].\n\nFor 2008, a U.S. version of a [[BBC]] game show called ''[[How Much Is Enough?]]'' debuted on January 8, 2008, hosted by [[Corbin Bernsen]], and then on March 31, 2008, ''[[Bingo America]]'' made its debut with [[Patrick Duffy]] as host. On July 21, 2008, as something of a tie-in with the movie ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', Merrill Heatter returned to game-show producing with ''[[Catch 21]]'' (a revival of the 1970s game ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'') hosted by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] with [[Mikki Padilla]] as the dealer. GSN also relaunched a live interactive call-in interstitial series, this time known as ''[[GSN Live]]'', which aired during commercial breaks between Noon and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday. Originally the series took place over a three-hour span, with [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Heidi Bohay]] hosting the interstitial segments. Later in the year GSN expanded the series to six hours, with Roggin moving to the 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. block with [[Kelly Packard]] while Alfonso Ribeiro replaced him earlier in the day. Packard was forced to leave her position shortly after taking it, and Roggin hosted with a guest host until May 15, 2009 when [[Debra Wilson|Debra Skelton]] was chosen to be a permanent co-host as of May 26, 2009. Roggin left GSN Live on July 2, 2009 in order to concentrate on his new game show ''[[The Money List]]''. Alfonso left GSN Live on August 11, 2009 in order to concentrate on hosting ''[[Catch 21]]''. ''GSN Live'' itself ended on July 29, 2011.\n\nAlso in 2009, ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' returned to the air on GSN, this time with [[Carnie Wilson]] as host.

The shows were filmed at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas in January and February 2011. The show lasted forty episodes before being canceled due to low ratings.\n\nIn August 23, 2012, ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]'' with [[Jeff Foxworthy]] became the channel's most popular program of all time, with the series premiere being watched by two million viewers. In the fall of 2012, GSN premiered a new revival titled ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The Pyramid]]'', with [[Mike Richards (producer)|Mike Richards]] hosting. GSN debuted an [[The Chase (American game show)|American version]] of the UK game show ''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]'' on August 6, 2013, hosted by [[Brooke Burns]] and featuring [[Mark Labbett]], one of the \"Chasers\" on the UK version, as the sole \"Chaser\", known as \"the Beast\". The show received a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show|Outstanding Game Show]] in 2014, and Burns received a nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] two years later. In the summer of 2014, GSN debuted new series such as ''[[It Takes a Church]]'', ''[[Skin Wars]]'', and ''[[Idiotest]]''.\n\nGSN premiered the original series ''[[America Says]]'', hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] on June 18, 2018, and the video clip game show ''[[Caroline & Friends]]'', hosted by actress [[Caroline Rhea]] on July 16, 2018. On March 21, 2019, GSN announced it would revive ''[[Catch 21]]'', featuring a different format with Ribeiro returning as host. The network also announced a new show, ''[[Best Ever Trivia Show]]'' with [[Sherri Shepherd]] as the host. The show debuted on June 10, 2019. GSN continued to introduce new originals, with ''[[Common Knowledge (game show)|Common Knowledge]]'' hosted by [[Joey Fatone]] debuting on January 14, 2019, the reboot of ''[[Catch 21]]'' with new dealer [[Witney Carson]] debuting on October 14, 2019, and ''[[Get a Clue (game show)|Get a Clue]]'' hosted by [[Robert Belushi]] premiering on January 6, 2020.\n\n====Specials====\nThe network has run blocks of classic game shows on Saturday nights, and for the first few months of 2006 programmed back-to-back episodes of ''[[Match Game]]'' in a block billed as ''That '70s Hour'' (a pun on ''[[That '70s Show]]''), which showed the original [[clapperboard|production slate]] before each episode as well as ''Match Game'' trivia and brief clips of an interview with host [[Gene Rayburn]] produced shortly before his death. Although production slates had been aired by the network prior to this, \"That '70s Hour\" was the first time the network ''intentionally'' did so. During the Summer of 2006, the network began a special seven-week run of ''The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time''.\n\nIn November 2006, GSN started a series of eight documentaries hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]], each about game shows, beginning with a program on ''Match Game'' titled ''Behind The Blank''. Other subjects included game show producer [[Chuck Barris]], ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'', a \"Top Ten\" countdown of game show hosts, memorable game show moments, women who have featured prominently on game shows, celebrities and how they impacted game shows, and an insider's guide to winning on a game show.\n\nOne particularly interesting subject was the installments of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' in which [[Michael Larson]] won more than $100,000 in cash and prizes by memorizing the sequences of the board then used, which was the subject of ''Big Bucks: The \"Press Your Luck\" Scandal''. Peter Tomarken, who had hosted ''Press Your Luck'', hosted and narrated this documentary in 2003. The documentary became Game Show Network's most watched show ever at the time scoring a 1.7 at one point during the show. Originally, CBS, the original broadcaster of ''Press Your Luck'', did not want GSN to air the Larson episodes. However, this angered many fans, causing CBS to allow Game Show Network to air the episodes as part of the documentary as well as standalone episodes.\n\nIn 2007, the network debuted two new specials: the ''[[National Vocabulary Championship]]'', with a show airing on April 15, 2007 showcasing the first year of the event, and a broadcast of the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] International Cat Show, ''Catminster''. In November 2008, GSN and [[Meow Mix]] presented a special entitled ''[[Think Like a Cat]]'', hosted by Chuck Woolery, with a top prize of $1 million, one of the few times a game show on cable television has had that amount as a grand prize. On December 16, 2014, GSN aired a special called ''Game Show Flashback'', hosted by Ben Gleib, which featured some of the best moments in game show history. GSN aired a 2-hour special called ''[[The Line (game show)|The Line]]'' on December 23, 2014, which was hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. On January 1, 2015, in preparation for the revival of ''[[Baggage (American game show)|Baggage]]'' entitled ''[[Baggage on the Road]]'', GSN aired a special called ''Baggage: Most Outrageous Moments'' hosted by Jerry Springer.\n\n===Acquired programming===\nGSN's acquired programming comes primarily from [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], with acquired programming also coming from [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], and [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. During the time that Liberty Media and successors DirecTV and AT&T had a stake in the channel from 2001 to 2019, GSN had had to pay a licensing fee to air game shows owned by founding parent company [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] subsidiary [[Columbia TriStar Television]].  Before that time period and again since Sony regained 100% ownership in November 2019, GSN has unlimited free access to the game shows owned by what is now Sony Pictures Television.\n\nFrom Fremantle, the network licenses ''[[Match Game]]'' (Rayburn), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (Harvey). GSN had licensed the entire [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] library from its inception until March 2009 and has in the past also licensed ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Sale of the Century (American game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (other Fremantle properties) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel [[Buzzr]], a digital subchannel network over which Fremantle has sole programming control.\n\nIn the network's infancy, GSN regularly showcased vintage Goodson-Todman game and panel shows from the 1950s and 1960s, many of which were either originally broadcast or only preserved in [[black-and-white]] \u2013 such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. These classic shows made up much of the channel's lineup at the outset, but have been gradually cut back in prominence since the late 1990s. On October 1, 2006, only ''What's My Line?'' had a regular spot on the schedule, late Sunday/early Monday at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, it was followed by a selection from various 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Goodson-Todman shows, usually another panel game. On December 19, 2006, GSN reinstated the ''Black and White Overnight'' to seven days a week from 3:00&nbsp;a.m. to 4:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, showcasing ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' in the block, other shows, including ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[The Name's the Same]]'', and the Bud Collyer-hosted primetime version of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' have been featured, this run ended March 31, 2009. ''Black and White Overnight'' has returned for two weeks in December since 2009, featuring ''What's My Line?'' and ''I've Got a Secret''.\n\nOver the years, GSN, in addition to its Goodson-Todman library, featured game shows from other studios:\n* [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]: ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' (2000), ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Dog Eat Dog (American game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (American game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[Minute to Win It]]''\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1998 version only)\n* [[MGM Television|MGM Domestic Television Distribution]]: ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1966 version only), ''[[Cash Cab (American game show)|Cash Cab]]''\n* [[Warner Bros.

(American game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' (Fox), ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', and ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''\n\nGSN also airs, or has aired, the [[Sony Pictures Television]] library programming from the following companies:\n* The Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (formerly [[Barris Industries]]): ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Gong Show]]'', ''[[Three's a Crowd (game show)|3's a Crowd]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt (American game show)|Treasure Hunt]]'', and ''[[Quiz Kids Challenge]]''.\n* [[Barry & Enright Productions]]: ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Break the Bank (1976 game show)|Break the Bank]]'', ''[[Bullseye (1980 U.S. game show)|Bullseye]]'', ''[[Play the Percentages]]'', and ''[[Bumper Stumpers]]''.\n* [[Merv Griffin Enterprises]]: ''[[Headline Chasers]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (excepting the Bob Goen era)\n* [[Stewart Television]]: ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot!]]'', ''[[Pass the Buck (American game show)|Pass the Buck]]'', ''[[Go (game show)|Go]]'', ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]]'', and the surviving ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' incarnations.\n* 2waytraffic: ''[[That's the Question (American game show)|That's the Question]]''\n* Sony Pictures Television (including its predecessors from [[Screen Gems]] to Columbia TriStar Television): ''Pyramid'', ''[[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]]'', ''[[Dealer's Choice (game show)|Dealer's Choice]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', ''The Fun Factory'', and ''[[Celebrity Charades]]''\n\nIn October 2003, GSN acquired the rerun rights to ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'' (from [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], both the network and syndicated versions) and have added more episodes since, including the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off from 2004; the show was off the schedule from November 2012 to December 2017, when repeats of the Chris Harrison episodes were added to the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/GSN-Adds-WHO-WANTS-TO-BE-A-MILLIONAIRE-to-Daytime-Schedule-1218-20171204|title=GSN Adds WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE to Daytime Schedule, 12/18|author=TV News Desk|website=Broadway World}}</ref> Among the most well-known classic game shows previously aired regularly on the network include ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[Love Connection]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''.\n\n===High-definition feed===\nGame Show Network HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed of the channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format; it was launched on September 15, 2010 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|title=Game Show Network Press Release|access-date=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111325/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-s-new-hd-service-launches-time-warner-cable-new-york-city-bright-house-networks-a|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The HD feed is currently carried on most providers nationwide and in Canada.\n\n===GSN On Demand===\nGSN partnered with Vubiquity to launch GSN On Demand on August 15, 2013.

The visiting [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] 26\u201323 in [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] to advance to their first [[Super Bowl]] since the [[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]] season. Prior to the game, the Saints were considered the favorite team to win. The two teams had previously faced each other in the regular season, also at the Superdome, where the Saints won 45\u201335.\n\nThe Rams and Saints both finished the regular season with a record of 13\u20133, with the Saints owning the tiebreaker due to their regular season win over the Rams, thus earning them the one seed. Once the season ended, the Saints became the team most favored to advanced to the Super Bowl. The outcome, however, went in the Rams' favor, after they came back from a 13\u20130 deficit, forced overtime, and scored a game-winning, 57-yard field goal, kicked by [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]]. Despite their victory, the lack of a penalty called on a controversial play late in the fourth quarter became the most discussed part of the game. The play saw Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] throw a pass to wide receiver [[Tommylee Lewis]], who was being covered by Rams cornerback [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]]. While the pass was still in the air, Robey-Coleman enforced an illegal, [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|helmet-to-helmet hit]] on Lewis. Despite the contact matching the criteria of [[pass interference]], no penalty flag was thrown. This prevented the Saints from potentially scoring a go-ahead touchdown and subsequently running out the clock, and instead helped the Rams force an overtime with the time remaining in the quarter.\n\nThe no-call, later nicknamed the \"'''NOLA No-Call'''\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/time-nfl-nola-no-call-lawsuit-232547915--nfl.html|title=A time-out for the NFL in 'NOLA no-call' lawsuit|website=sports.yahoo.com}}</ref> proved to be controversial, with numerous media outlets reporting on it as well as some claiming that it cost the Saints the game. Immediately after the game concluded, the NFL admitted that a mistake made was made by the referees on the play. Robey-Coleman, who also acknowledged that his hit was illegal, was fined $26,739 by the league a few days after the game for initiating helmet-to-helmet contact. A group of Saints fans and season ticket holders filed a lawsuit against the NFL, asking the court to mandate that the game be replayed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/398390973/NFL-s-missed-call|title=NFL's missed call {{!}} Diversity Jurisdiction {{!}} Amount In Controversy|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> However, league commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] determined that the no-call was an act of human error by the referees and that it was not enough to reverse the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"MartinCNN\">{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Jill|title=Goodell on blown Saints call: 'Our officials are human'|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/30/sport/roger-goodell-super-bowl-liii-press-conference/index.html|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|website=CNN.com|date=January 30, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The controversy also sparked conversation about changing the rules to allow coaches to ask for [[Replay review in gridiron football|replay review]] on judgment calls. The Rams advanced to [[Super Bowl LIII]], where they lost to the [[2018 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], with a score of 13\u20133, on February 3; a rematch of 2002's [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where the Patriots also defeated the Rams (when the franchise was based in St. Louis) 20\u201317.\n\n==Background==\nThe 2018 regular seasons saw both the Saints and the Rams improve upon 11-5 records to both go 13-3. The two teams won their respective divisions for the second year in a row. In the 2017 playoffs, the Saints divisional rival [[Carolina Panthers]] in the Wild Card Round before falling to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the Divisional Round after the Vikings scored a last-second touchdown that would become known as the [[Minneapolis Miracle]]. The Rams had fallen to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the Wild Card Round.\n\nIn the 2018 season, the Saints and Rams respectively secured the 1 and 2 seeds, ensuring they would get a first-round bye and play in the NFC Divisonal Round. In the Divisional Round, the Saints played the sixth-seeded and defending Super Bowl champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Although they fell behind 14-0 in the first quarter after Eagles quarterback [[Nick Foles]] scored two touchdowns, the Saints scored 20 unanswered points to win the game, with cornerback [[Marshon Lattimore]] intercepting Nick Foles in Saints territory on the Eagles' final drive. It was the Saints' first NFC Championship game appearance since the 2009 season, when they won [[Super Bowl XLIV]]. The Rams played the fourth-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] and defeated them by a score of 30-22 as running backs [[C.J. Anderson]] and [[Todd Gurley]] each rushed for over 100 yards and combined for three touchdowns. It was the Rams' first NFC championship appearance since the 2001 season, when they were the St. Louis Rams and advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where they lost to the [[New England Patriots]].\n\n==Game summary==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nAfter a Saints field goal, [[Jared Goff|Jared Goff's]] second throw of the game was intercepted by [[Demario Davis]] at the Rams 17 yard line. The Saints kicked another field goal, and the Rams failed to get a first down again and were forced to punt. The Saints marched 63 yards down the field and scored a touchdown, making the score 13-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Rams scored a field goal halfway through the second quarter. After two punts by the Saints and one by the Rams, the Rams scored a touchdown on a 6 yard [[Todd Gurley]] run, cutting the lead to 3 points at the end of the half.\nIn the second half, the Rams started with a punt. The two teams then traded touchdowns, making the score 20-17 in favor of the Saints. In the fourth quarter, another controversial no-call occurred during the Rams scoring drive, when Saints linebacker A.J. Klein was not flagged for a personal foul for an intentional facemask on Goff <*[THIS DESCR OF THE SO CALLED \"INT FACEMASK PENALTY\" IS BS!

The penalty would have given the Rams first-and-goal on the 1, likely resulting in a 24-20 lead which would have forced New Orleans to score a touchdown on its following drive, regardless of whether the pass interference was called or not. Instead, the Rams had to settle for a field goal to tie the game with 5:03 remaining.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019012000/2018/POST3/rams@saints|title=Watch Los Angeles Rams vs. New Orleans Saints [01/20/2019] including a live Drive Chart and real-time highlights|website=www.nfl.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n===Controversial play===\n[[File:DPI No Call.png|thumb|[[Los Angeles Rams]] cornerback [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]] (white jersey) commits the illegal, [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|helmet-to-helmet hit]] on [[New Orleans Saints]] receiver [[Tommylee Lewis]] that went uncalled by the officials.]]\nPrior to the controversial play, the game was tied 20-20. The Saints offense had stalled inside the red-zone at the Rams 13-yard line. The play occurred on 3rd down with 10 yards to go for a first down. Had the Saints picked up that first down, they could have ran the clock to under 20 seconds before attempting a field goal, and likely would have punched their ticket to the [[Super Bowl LIII|Super Bowl]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nflspinzone.com/2019/02/05/new-orleans-saints-super-bowl-53-better-rams/|title=New Orleans Saints: How would team have been better in Super Bowl 53?|date=2019-02-05|website=NFL Spin Zone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Had they failed to convert, they would have left the Rams with plenty of time to drive down the field with a chance to win the game.\n\nThe play occurred with 1:49 remaining in the 4th quarter. [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]], the announcers on the [[Fox NFL|Fox]] broadcast, had the following call:<blockquote>\n\nBuck: \"Quick snap, Brees. Pass is...incomplete, no flag for Tommylee Lewis. Nickell Robey-Coleman delivered a hit, and the two officials talked to each other. Crowd's going crazy as there's no flag right on the Saints sideline\".\n\nAikman: \"Well, if Nickell Robey-Coleman plays the ball, it's an interception! He's probably going the other way with it.

Brees threw the ball toward the right sideline, targeting Tommylee Lewis. Before Lewis could attempt to catch the ball, he was blindsided by Nickell Robey-Coleman around the 6 yard line, knocking Lewis to the ground. No flag was thrown. Saints head coach [[Sean Payton]] was enraged and appealed to the referees for a call, but to no avail. The controversial play appeared to be a violation of two rules from the NFL Rulebook. Rule 8.5.2(a) states that \"contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent\u2019s opportunity to make the catch\" is prohibited. Rule 8.5.2(e) prohibits players from \"cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball\".<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 NFL Rulebook|url=https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2018-nfl-rulebook/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Operations.NFL.com|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Immediately after the play, Robey-Coleman can be seen looking side-to-side, likely anticipating a penalty flag. He stated after the game that he got away with a penalty, telling reporters \"Hell yeah, that was a PI. I did my part. Referee made the call.

The visiting [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] 26\u201323 in [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] to advance to their first [[Super Bowl]] since the [[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]] season. Prior to the game, the Saints were considered the favorite team to win. The two teams had previously faced each other in the regular season, also at the Superdome, where the Saints won 45\u201335.\n\nThe Rams and Saints both finished the regular season with a record of 13\u20133, with the Saints owning the tiebreaker due to their regular season win over the Rams, thus earning them the one seed. Once the season ended, the Saints became the team most favored to advanced to the Super Bowl. The outcome, however, went in the Rams' favor, after they came back from a 13\u20130 deficit, forced overtime, and scored a game-winning, 57-yard field goal, kicked by [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]]. Despite their victory, the lack of a penalty called on a controversial play late in the fourth quarter became the most discussed part of the game. The play saw Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] throw a pass to wide receiver [[Tommylee Lewis]], who was being covered by Rams cornerback [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]]. While the pass was still in the air, Robey-Coleman enforced an illegal, [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|helmet-to-helmet hit]] on Lewis. Despite the contact matching the criteria of [[pass interference]], no penalty flag was thrown. This prevented the Saints from potentially scoring a go-ahead touchdown and subsequently running out the clock, and instead helped the Rams force an overtime with the time remaining in the quarter.\n\nThe no-call, later nicknamed the \"'''NOLA No-Call'''\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/time-nfl-nola-no-call-lawsuit-232547915--nfl.html|title=A time-out for the NFL in 'NOLA no-call' lawsuit|website=sports.yahoo.com}}</ref> proved to be controversial, with numerous media outlets reporting on it as well as some claiming that it cost the Saints the game. Immediately after the game concluded, the NFL admitted that a mistake made was made by the referees on the play. Robey-Coleman, who also acknowledged that his hit was illegal, was fined $26,739 by the league a few days after the game for initiating helmet-to-helmet contact. A group of Saints fans and season ticket holders filed a lawsuit against the NFL, asking the court to mandate that the game be replayed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/398390973/NFL-s-missed-call|title=NFL's missed call {{!}} Diversity Jurisdiction {{!}} Amount In Controversy|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> However, league commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] determined that the no-call was an act of human error by the referees and that it was not enough to reverse the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"MartinCNN\">{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Jill|title=Goodell on blown Saints call: 'Our officials are human'|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/30/sport/roger-goodell-super-bowl-liii-press-conference/index.html|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|website=CNN.com|date=January 30, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The controversy also sparked conversation about changing the rules to allow coaches to ask for [[Replay review in gridiron football|replay review]] on judgment calls. The Rams advanced to [[Super Bowl LIII]], where they lost to the [[2018 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], with a score of 13\u20133, on February 3; a rematch of 2002's [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where the Patriots also defeated the Rams (when the franchise was based in St. Louis) 20\u201317.\n\n==Background==\nThe 2018 regular seasons saw both the Saints and the Rams improve upon 11-5 records to both go 13-3. The two teams won their respective divisions for the second year in a row. In the 2017 playoffs, the Saints divisional rival [[Carolina Panthers]] in the Wild Card Round before falling to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the Divisional Round after the Vikings scored a last-second touchdown that would become known as the [[Minneapolis Miracle]]. The Rams had fallen to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the Wild Card Round.\n\nIn the 2018 season, the Saints and Rams respectively secured the 1 and 2 seeds, ensuring they would get a first-round bye and play in the NFC Divisonal Round. In the Divisional Round, the Saints played the sixth-seeded and defending Super Bowl champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Although they fell behind 14-0 in the first quarter after Eagles quarterback [[Nick Foles]] scored two touchdowns, the Saints scored 20 unanswered points to win the game, with cornerback [[Marshon Lattimore]] intercepting Nick Foles in Saints territory on the Eagles' final drive. It was the Saints' first NFC Championship game appearance since the 2009 season, when they won [[Super Bowl XLIV]]. The Rams played the fourth-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] and defeated them by a score of 30-22 as running backs [[C.J. Anderson]] and [[Todd Gurley]] each rushed for over 100 yards and combined for three touchdowns. It was the Rams' first NFC championship appearance since the 2001 season, when they were the St. Louis Rams and advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where they lost to the [[New England Patriots]].\n\n==Game summary==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nAfter a Saints field goal, [[Jared Goff|Jared Goff's]] second throw of the game was intercepted by [[Demario Davis]] at the Rams 17 yard line. The Saints kicked another field goal, and the Rams failed to get a first down again and were forced to punt. The Saints marched 63 yards down the field and scored a touchdown, making the score 13-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Rams scored a field goal halfway through the second quarter. After two punts by the Saints and one by the Rams, the Rams scored a touchdown on a 6 yard [[Todd Gurley]] run, cutting the lead to 3 points at the end of the half.\nIn the second half, the Rams started with a punt. The two teams then traded touchdowns, making the score 20-17 in favor of the Saints. In the fourth quarter, another controversial no-call occurred during the Rams scoring drive, when Saints linebacker A.J. Klein was not flagged for a personal foul for an intentional facemask on Goff. The penalty would have given the Rams first-and-goal on the 1, likely resulting in a 24-20 lead which would have forced New Orleans to score a touchdown on its following drive, regardless of whether the pass interference was called or not. Instead, the Rams had to settle for a field goal to tie the game with 5:03 remaining.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019012000/2018/POST3/rams@saints|title=Watch Los Angeles Rams vs. New Orleans Saints [01/20/2019] including a live Drive Chart and real-time highlights|website=www.nfl.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n===Controversial play===\n[[File:DPI No Call.png|thumb|[[Los Angeles Rams]] cornerback [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]] (white jersey) commits the illegal, [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|helmet-to-helmet hit]] on [[New Orleans Saints]] receiver [[Tommylee Lewis]] that went uncalled by the officials.]]\nPrior to the controversial play, the game was tied 20-20. The Saints offense had stalled inside the red-zone at the Rams 13-yard line. The play occurred on 3rd down with 10 yards to go for a first down. Had the Saints picked up that first down, they could have ran the clock to under 20 seconds before attempting a field goal, and likely would have punched their ticket to the [[Super Bowl LIII|Super Bowl]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nflspinzone.com/2019/02/05/new-orleans-saints-super-bowl-53-better-rams/|title=New Orleans Saints: How would team have been better in Super Bowl 53?|date=2019-02-05|website=NFL Spin Zone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Had they failed to convert, they would have left the Rams with plenty of time to drive down the field with a chance to win the game.\n\nThe play occurred with 1:49 remaining in the 4th quarter. [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]], the announcers on the [[Fox NFL|Fox]] broadcast, had the following call:<blockquote>\n\nBuck: \"Quick snap, Brees. Pass is...incomplete, no flag for Tommylee Lewis. Nickell Robey-Coleman delivered a hit, and the two officials talked to each other. Crowd's going crazy as there's no flag right on the Saints sideline\".\n\nAikman: \"Well, if Nickell Robey-Coleman plays the ball, it's an interception! He's probably going the other way with it. I mean the ball's on the other side of Robey-Coleman and...but that should have been a penalty, and Sean Payton is justifiably upset\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Edholm|first=Eric|title=Missed PI might have been worst non-call ever, but will NFL change replay because of it?|url=https://www.profootballweekly.com/2019/01/21/missed-pi-might-have-been-worst-non-call-ever-but-will-nfl-change-replay-because-of-it/apmrsag/|website=ProFootballWeekly.com|date=January 21, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe play began at 1:49, with quarterback [[Drew Brees]] taking the ball and dropping back to pass. Brees threw the ball toward the right sideline, targeting Tommylee Lewis. Before Lewis could attempt to catch the ball, he was blindsided by Nickell Robey-Coleman around the 6 yard line, knocking Lewis to the ground. No flag was thrown. Saints head coach [[Sean Payton]] was enraged and appealed to the referees for a call, but to no avail. The controversial play appeared to be a violation of two rules from the NFL Rulebook. Rule 8.5.2(a) states that \"contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent\u2019s opportunity to make the catch\" is prohibited. Rule 8.5.2(e) prohibits players from \"cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball\".<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 NFL Rulebook|url=https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2018-nfl-rulebook/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Operations.NFL.com|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Immediately after the play, Robey-Coleman can be seen looking side-to-side, likely anticipating a penalty flag. He stated after the game that he got away with a penalty, telling reporters \"Hell yeah, that was a PI. I did my part. Referee made the call. We respect it\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Nate|title=Rams' Nickell Robey-Coleman on if he committed pass interference vs. Saints: 'Hell yeah'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2019/01/20/nfl-pass-interference-los-angeles-rams-nickell-robey-coleman/2634080002/|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|language=en|date=January 20, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Robey-Coleman was also reported as stating that he was intentionally committing a penalty to prevent a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Kevin|title=A Blown Call in the NFC Championship Game Exposed the NFL\u2019s Officiating Crisis|url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/21/18191960/nfl-referees-nfc-championship-game-super-bowl|website=TheRinger.com|date=January 21, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Lewis, too, was looking for a flag.

The Rams had only one timeout left, meaning the Saints likely could have run the clock down to about 10\u201315 seconds and attempted a short field goal to take the lead. The Saints' win probability was calculated at 98% if pass interference had been called. After the non-call, their win probability dropped to 78%.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenburg|first=Neil|title=The biggest swings in win probability from the AFC and NFC championship games|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/01/21/biggest-swings-win-probability-afc-nfc-championship-games/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 21, 2019|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Remainder of fourth quarter===\nAlthough the Saints were deprived of a crucial touchdown, they did manage a field goal to take the lead 23\u201320 with 1:41 remaining. The Rams put together a quick nine-play drive and kicked a 48-yard field goal with 15 seconds left in the game to tie the score. The Saints elected to kneel the ball, and send the game into overtime.\n\n===Overtime===\nThe Saints won the overtime coin toss and elected to receive the opening kickoff. They picked up a quick 15 yards on a pass interference call, but the drive stalled. On 2nd and 16, just 1 minute into overtime, Brees was hit on the arm by Rams linebacker [[Dante Fowler Jr.|Dante Fowler]] while throwing deep and the ball was intercepted by [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]]. On the ensuing drive, the Rams drove down the field and [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] kicked the 57-yard game-winning field goal, sending the team to the Super Bowl.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe win advanced the Rams to [[Super Bowl LIII]], in which they were defeated by the [[2018 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]], 13\u20133.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=401038115|title=Patriots vs. Rams - Game Summary - February 3, 2019 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> Saints head coach [[Sean Payton]], who had reacted demonstrably to the non-call on the sideline during the game, delivered strong remarks in his postgame press conference:\n\n<blockquote>\"Disappointing way to lose a game...frustrating, you know.

The lawsuit, filed by Tommy Badeaux and Candis Lambert \"individually and on behalf of New Orleans Saints Season Ticket Holders, New Orleans Saints National Fan Base a/k/a The [[Who Dat?|Who Dat]] Nation and any party with interest that has been affected by the outcome,\" names Roger Goodell and the NFL as defendants.<ref name=\":12\" /> The lawsuit asks the Louisiana Court \"to mandate the extraordinary step of ordering a replay of the NFC Championship Game, and for damages to all putative class member Saints fans. The consequences of ordering are replay of the NFC Championship Game or any portion of the game cannot be overstated\". Such an order would have been the first in history. The next day, the NFL publicly acknowledged the missed call for the first time. In the same press release, they asked that the lawsuit be thrown out on the grounds that \"this kind of dispute implicates no legally cognizable rights\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Schad|first=Tom|title=Court document: NFL admits blown call in NFC title game, says it wants lawsuit thrown out|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/01/28/nfl-nfc-championship-game-saints-rams-nickell-robey-coleman/2699361002/|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The court denied the plaintiffs request to replay the game days later.

It is hosted by [[Kris Aquino]] with Brod Pete as the \"bingo caller\" and Mel Feliciano as the \"commissioner\", who referees the playing studio audience.<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/guide/3618/Kris-Aquino-will-host-Pinoy-Bingo-Night-starting-March-30 Kris Aquino will host Pinoy Bingo Night starting March 30] at PEP.ph</ref><ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/headlines/Article/2991/Pinoy-Bingo-Night-makes-a-grand-debut.aspx Pinoy Bingo Night makes a grand debut] retrieved via www.abs-cbn.com 03-31-2009</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nMembers of the studio audience attempt to win a game of [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] while competing against a solo studio contestant. Each episode consisted of two games without any distinction other than order (the original version has three games represented by red, white and blue bingo cards). Furthermore, the bingo cards used in this show don't have the \"Free\" space in the center. Originally, there were two groups each playing a game, but later the games involved one studio audience, each member holding two cards and the winners in the first game were replaced by new players.\n\nMost solo studio contestants are celebrities, but has been normal people in several occasions. After 39 episodes, two celebrities play one game.\n\nIn each game, the solo contestant competes in a minigame that also serves to unveil the numbers being called for the game. He or she then tries to complete the minigame and outlast the audience before they could declare bingo. If they are successful, they win \u20b11,000,000; if an audience member beats them to it, they walk away with nothing and the audience member wins \u20b150,000. In case of a tie, the audience member still wins.\n\nAfter 16 episodes, the game rules have been changed. From the 17th episode onwards, an episode only consists of one game. When only one audience member gets a bingo, the audience member is given the option to take over from the first solo contestant to become the second and finish the game to win a million. If the audience member decides to take the spot, he/she must risk half of the \u20b150,000 and continue the game to win \u20b11,000,000. The other audience members who are one ball away from winning (or ''puro'', the local term used) are still playing for a bingo. If an audience member gets a bingo, he/she will get \u20b150,000 while the second solo contestant that took over still gets \u20b125,000. In case more than one audience member won over the first solo contestant(s), they would be given individual choices on whether to continue the solo contestant's game. If more than one of them decide to continue and eventually win the solo contestant's game, they would each have a share of the million-peso price; they would take home \u20b125,000 each should they continue the game and lose. In case at least one audience member gains a bingo just as the solo player finishes the game (still applying the audience-member-wins rule), the winning audience member will not have to replay the last moments of the game anymore, and instead is automatically given \u20b1900,000,000.\n\nContestants could only use certain drawn balls to put towards their game, determined by correctly guessing whether the next number is either red or black, odd or even, depending on the rules given by host.\n\nThe minigames and their rules are as follows:\n* '''Bingo 500:''' The contestant aims to have all their bingo balls drawn add up to 500. In order to be credited to the total, the contestant has to correctly guess that the next drawn ball is odd or even or its text is colored red or black depending on the rules given by the host.\n* '''9 Ball:''' The contestant aims to eliminate the [[billiard ball]]s 1 to 9. In order for this to happen, the contestant must guess if the next drawn ball is odd or even or its text is colored red or black depending on the rules given by the host. A correct guess would eliminate the billiard balls corresponding to the digits on the drawn ball.\n* '''Money Bags:''' The contestant chooses one of three ten-digit bank account numbers. The player has to eliminate the digits of the account number in the same way as in 9-Ball (if a digit appears at least twice in the number, all instances of that digit is eliminated). In order for this to happen, the contestant must guess if the text on the next drawn ball is colored red or black or if it is odd or even depending on the rules given by the host.\n* '''High 7:''' The contestant has to draw six balls bearing the number 7 (such as \"B-7,\" \"I-17,\" etc.).\n* '''Around the Philippines:''' Twelve Philippine place names are listed. The player must eliminate each of the twelve by correctly guessing if the next drawn ball is odd or even or if the text is red or black depending on the rules given by the host.\n* '''Bingo Crossword:''' Two of the word ''bingo'', intersected at letter I, [[crossword]]-style, is shown. The contestant must guess if the text of the next ball drawn is colored red or black. A correct guess would highlight a letter corresponding to the one on the drawn ball. In order to win, the player must have the word \"BINGO\" highlighted both vertically and horizontally on the puzzle.\n\nDuring the duration of the program's run, there have been eleven millionaires and one millionaire ''team''.<!--NO LIST OF MILLION-PESO WINNERS, PLEASE. That's considered listcruft. Such list will be removed on sight.-->\n\n==Homeviewer game==\nHome viewers could collect pre-printed game cards by exchanging proofs-of-purchase of the show's sponsors or purchase items totaling a certain amount, depending on the sponsor. 20 numbers are drawn and nine of those numbers should appear in an X-pattern on the card for it to be declared a winning card. Winning cards could be redeemed for a single \u20b1150,000 daily cash prize and a \u20b150,000 bonus cash prize. Holders of the cards must register the cards' serial numbers through [[short message service|SMS]] in order for the cards to be qualified for the additional bonus cash prize. An additional \u20b150,000 is added to the bonus cash prize for every day it is not won by a registered bingo card holder. Also, in case there is more than one winner, regardless of whether or not they were registered, they would have to share the daily cash prize. Only one registered card holder could win the bonus prize, and if there is more than registered winning card holder, the prize is raffled off. Also, cards are playable for one week (five episodes), but the set of drawn balls for the cards is different for each day of the week. The balls drawn for this game are different from those used in the studio games.\n\nA second homeviewers' game is also launched viewers note and send via SMS the last ball of each of the two games in the episode. The cash prize the winner receives depends on who won on the two games. If one solo player wins a million, the homeviewer winner gets \u20b1100,000. If both solo players win a million each, the homeviewer would win \u20b1200,000. If both solo players are beaten by at least a studio contestant each, the winning viewer would receive \u20b110,000. The rules were slightly modified since the rule change to one game per episode, wherein the last ball drawn should be noted. <!--NO LIST OF MILLION-PESO WINNERS, PLEASE. That's considered listcruft.
