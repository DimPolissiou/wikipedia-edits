To clarify:\n\n* The chosen rook may be under attack.\n* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not.  (When castling queenside, the only such square is the one adjacent to the rook.)\n* The king may have been in check earlier in the game, provided the king did not move when resolving the check.\n\nIn [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.<ref name=\"Abrahams\">\n{{citation\n | last = Abrahams\n | first = Gerald\n | authorlink = Gerald Abrahams\n | title = Chess\n | publisher = English Universities Press\n | series = Teach Yourself Books\n | year = 1948\n | page = 59\n | isbn =}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n{{See also|Chess opening|}}\n\nCastling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it often moves the king into a safer position away from the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board. \n\nThe choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and often all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended; the king is thus often later moved to b1 to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen, if not already done; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&nbsp;\u2013 on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.\n\nIt is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].\n\nIf the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.\n\n==Tournament rules==\n{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}\n\nUnder the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move. Under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, however, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to castle, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to move the king first. As usual, the player may change their mind to another legal destination square for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.\n\nThe official rules also require that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.<ref>[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that \"most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity.\"</ref>\n\nThe right to castle must be the same on all three occasions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.\n\n==Chess variants and problems==\nSome [[chess variant]]s, for example [[Chess960]], have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]], which is played on a 10\u00d78 board. In [[shogi]], the term ''[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]'' refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.\n\nWriting in 2019, former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] proposed a variation of chess where players wouldn't have the ability to castle.  As the king can no longer castle into safety, this variant would theoretically lead to more dynamic and interesting games as it is much harder to force a draw and your pieces are forced to engage in melee. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/no-castling-chess-kramnik-alphazero|title=Kramnik And AlphaZero: How To Rethink Chess|last=Kramnik (VladimirKramnik)|first=Vladimir|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or the chosen rook has previously moved.\n\n==Notable examples==\n* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}</ref> The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref> <!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' -->\n* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]\u2013[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.

There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move.  The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat.  This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century.  In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}}, and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.\n\nBefore the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board.  When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.\n\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,<ref>c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]</ref> if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.)  In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.\n\nIn Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called \"free castling\".\n\nIn the [[G\u00f6ttingen manuscript]] (c. 1500) and a game published by [[Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena]] in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.\n\nThe current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=66}}.\n\nIn the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]] introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between \"0-0r\" (r=right) and \"0-0l\" (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by [[Aaron Alexandre]].<ref>Stefan B\u00fccker: \"Was bedeutet 0-0?\" (What does 0-0 mean?), in: ''[[Kaissiber]]'', No. 18, 2002, pp.70\u201371</ref> The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]''.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word \"rook\" (e.g. ''rochieren, rochada, enroque''), while the local adjectives meaning \"long\" and \"short\" (or \"big\" and \"small\")  are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial castling]]\n* [[Chess notation]]\n** [[Algebraic notation (chess)|Algebraic chess notation]]\n** [[Descriptive chess notation]]\n* [[Outline of chess#Rules of chess|Outline of chess: Rules of chess]]\n* [[Rules of chess]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n|last=Davidson|first=Henry\n|origyear=1949 |year=1981\n|title=A Short History of Chess\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 978-0-679-14550-9}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Evans|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess player)\n|year=1970\n|title=Chess Catechism\n|publisher=Simon and Schuster\n|isbn= 0-671-20491-2}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Hooper | first=David | authorlink=David Vincent Hooper\n | last2=Whyld | first2=Kenneth | authorlink2=Kenneth Whyld\n | year=1992\n | title=[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]\n | edition=2nd\n |contribution=castling\n | publisher=Oxford University Press\n | isbn=0-19-280049-3 }}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Just|first=Tim\n|last2=Burg|first2=Daniel B.\n|year=2003\n|title=U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess\n|edition=5th\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 0-8129-3559-4}}\n* {{citation\n   | last=Lombardy\n   | first=William\n   | authorlink=William Lombardy\n   | last2=Daniels\n   | first2=David\n   | year=1975\n   | title=Chess Panorama\n   | publisher=Chilton\n   | isbn=0-8019-6078-9\n   | url-access=registration\n   | url=https://archive.org/details/chesspanorama00lomb\n   }}\n*{{citation\n|last=Murray|first=H.

Castling on the kingside is sometimes called ''castling short'' (the rook moves a short distance, i.e. two squares) while castling on the queenside is called ''castling long'' (the rook moves a long distance, i.e. three squares) {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.\n\nCastling was added to European chess in the 14th or 15th century and did not develop into its present form until the 17th century.

To clarify:\n\n* The chosen rook may be under attack.\n* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not.  (When castling queenside, the only such square is the one adjacent to the rook.)\n* The king may have been in check earlier in the game, provided the king did not move when resolving the check.\n\nIn [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.<ref name=\"Abrahams\">\n{{citation\n | last = Abrahams\n | first = Gerald\n | authorlink = Gerald Abrahams\n | title = Chess\n | publisher = English Universities Press\n | series = Teach Yourself Books\n | year = 1948\n | page = 59\n | isbn =}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n{{See also|Chess opening|}}\n\nCastling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it often moves the king into a safer position away from the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board. \n\nThe choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and often all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended; the king is thus often later moved to b1 to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen, if not already done; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&nbsp;\u2013 on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.\n\nIt is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].\n\nIf the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.\n\n==Tournament rules==\n{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}\n\nUnder the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move. Under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, however, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to castle, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to move the king first. As usual, the player may change their mind to another legal destination square for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.\n\nThe official rules also require that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.<ref>[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that \"most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity.\"</ref>\n\nThe right to castle must be the same on all three occasions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.\n\n==Chess variants and problems==\nSome [[chess variant]]s, for example [[Chess960]], have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]], which is played on a 10\u00d78 board. In [[shogi]], the term ''[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]'' refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.\n\nWriting in 2019, former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] proposed a variation of chess where players wouldn't have the ability to castle.  As the king can no longer castle into safety, this variant would theoretically lead to more dynamic and interesting games as it is much harder to force a draw and your pieces are forced to engage in melee. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/no-castling-chess-kramnik-alphazero|title=Kramnik And AlphaZero: How To Rethink Chess|last=Kramnik (VladimirKramnik)|first=Vladimir|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or the chosen rook has previously moved.\n\n==Notable examples==\n* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}</ref> The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref> <!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' -->\n* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]\u2013[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.

There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move.  The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat.  This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century.  In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}}, and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.\n\nBefore the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board.  When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.\n\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,<ref>c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]</ref> if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.)  In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.\n\nIn Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called \"free castling\".\n\nIn the [[G\u00f6ttingen manuscript]] (c. 1500) and a game published by [[Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena]] in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.\n\nThe current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=66}}.\n\nIn the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]] introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between \"0-0r\" (r=right) and \"0-0l\" (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by [[Aaron Alexandre]].<ref>Stefan B\u00fccker: \"Was bedeutet 0-0?\" (What does 0-0 mean?), in: ''[[Kaissiber]]'', No. 18, 2002, pp.70\u201371</ref> The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]''.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word \"rook\" (e.g. ''rochieren, rochada, enroque''), while the local adjectives meaning \"long\" and \"short\" (or \"big\" and \"small\")  are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial castling]]\n* [[Chess notation]]\n** [[Algebraic notation (chess)|Algebraic chess notation]]\n** [[Descriptive chess notation]]\n* [[Outline of chess#Rules of chess|Outline of chess: Rules of chess]]\n* [[Rules of chess]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n|last=Davidson|first=Henry\n|origyear=1949 |year=1981\n|title=A Short History of Chess\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 978-0-679-14550-9}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Evans|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess player)\n|year=1970\n|title=Chess Catechism\n|publisher=Simon and Schuster\n|isbn= 0-671-20491-2}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Hooper | first=David | authorlink=David Vincent Hooper\n | last2=Whyld | first2=Kenneth | authorlink2=Kenneth Whyld\n | year=1992\n | title=[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]\n | edition=2nd\n |contribution=castling\n | publisher=Oxford University Press\n | isbn=0-19-280049-3 }}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Just|first=Tim\n|last2=Burg|first2=Daniel B.\n|year=2003\n|title=U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess\n|edition=5th\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 0-8129-3559-4}}\n* {{citation\n   | last=Lombardy\n   | first=William\n   | authorlink=William Lombardy\n   | last2=Daniels\n   | first2=David\n   | year=1975\n   | title=Chess Panorama\n   | publisher=Chilton\n   | isbn=0-8019-6078-9\n   | url-access=registration\n   | url=https://archive.org/details/chesspanorama00lomb\n   }}\n*{{citation\n|last=Murray|first=H.
