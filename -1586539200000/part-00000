He began his career as a pioneering figure in Japanese [[experimental film]] during the 1960s before transitioning to directing more mainstream works such as television and feature films. He was most commonly known for being the director of the 1977 cult hit ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]'', but he made numerous other films in his filmmaking career spanning almost 60 years. He was notable for his distinct experimental and psychedelic filmmaking style, as well as the [[Anti war film|anti-war]] themes commonly embedded in his films.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Honolulu Festival Parade - Grand Marshals (6869570396).jpg|thumb|200px|with [[:ja:\u68ee\u6c11\u592b|Tamio Mori]] at Honolulu Festival (in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] on March 4, 2012)]]\n[[File:Obayashi Nobuhiko from \"HANAGATAMI\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2017 (28423832079).jpg|thumb|200px|at the Opening Ceremony of [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] (in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], [[Tokyo]] on October 25, 2017)]]\nObayashi was born on 9 January 1938 in the city of [[Onomichi, Hiroshima|Onomichi]], Japan. He was the eldest son of a father who was one in a long paternal line of medical doctors. As his father was called to the battlefront during [[World War II]], he was raised in his early infancy by his maternal grandparents. Through his childhood and adolescence Obayashi followed many artistic pursuits including drawing, writing, playing the piano, and a growing interest in animation and film.\n\nIn 1955 Obayashi, at the urging of his father, began procedures to enter medical school and become a doctor. However, he shortly thereafter abandoned this initiative partway through an entrance examination in order to follow his artistic interests. In 1956 he was accepted to the liberal arts department of [[Seijo University]] where he began to work with 8 and 16mm film. Toward the end of his stay at the university Obayashi began working on a series of experimental films. Along with works by other filmmakers such as [[Shuji Terayama]] and [[Donald Richie]], Obayshi's films would develop the tone of Japanese experimental cinema through the 1960s. In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of avant-garde techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films while earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements. Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works. In the 1970s he began a series of Japanese ads featuring well-known American stars such as [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Charles Bronson]]. Obayashi began directing feature films starting in 1977 with the horror comedy ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]''. The film employed a mixture of trick photography and avant-garde techniques to achieve its distinctive, surreal visuals, and has gone on to be considered a cult classic. It earned Obayashi the [[Blue Ribbon Awards|Blue Ribbon Award]] for Best New Director and has been ranked among the greatest Japanese films ever made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tv6tMUEJ?url=http://www.kinejun.jp/special/90alltimebest/index.html|title=WebCite query result|website=www.webcitation.org|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref> Through the 1980s and onwards he continued to make feature films and broadened his mainstream appeal.

It is rare for a single deity to straddle both of these [[Hindu denominations]]. She is sometimes suspected to be a [[Buddhist tantric figure]], as she holds a book, [[Veena]] and handbell, which are [[Mahayana]] symbols.

The people of the [[Kendrapara]], [[Jagatsinghpur]] and [[Cuttack]] districts are so attached to the goddess that they make it a point to visit the temple at least once per year.\n\n==Significance==\nThe Maa Sarala temple is one of the most historically significant expressions of Shaktism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} It is believed that the temple in the village of Sarala (Kanakapur) of the [[Jagatsinghpur]] district, on the eastern coast of India represents Goddess Sarala's heavenly abode. The goddess herself represents a synthesis of the divine figures of [[Durga]] and [[Matangi]].\n\nThe [[sanctum sanctorum]] of the main temple contains three idols of the goddess. The main idol, carved out of stone, is an eight-armed figure of the goddess with her right foot on a lion, in the classic posture of Durga destroying the demon [[Mahishasura]]. She holds a [[sword]] (khadga), [[trident]] (trishul), [[manuscript]] (pustak) and lute or [[veena]] in her right hands and a disk (pattisha), [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] (karmuka), bell (ghanta) and the head of the demon in her left hands. The second idol is four-armed, holding a conch shell ([[shankha]]) and a [[chakram]], and making gestures of gift giving (v[[Varadamudra|aradamudra]]) and fearlessness ([[abhayamudra]]). The third idol is two-armed, made out of eight precious metals ([[ashtadhatu]]). The idols are taken out of the temple for different ceremonial occasions.\n\n==Temple==\nHistorical evidence suggests that the original temple was constructed during the [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty|Bhauma-Kara]] in the 8th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The Goddess Maa Sarala was worshiped in this temple till the end of Hindu rule in 1568 A.D.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} In 1568 AD the Supreme Commander of the Muslim army [[Kalapahad]]a of Bengali Sultan Suleman Karani raided the original shrine and partly destroyed the Shakti temple.

The ruined temple was renovated in 1982 and is now dedicated to the worship of Lord Ganesh under the patronage of the Sarala Trust.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome important ceremonies are still observed in the old shrine. The processional idol \u201cChalanti Vigraha\u201d of Sharala is brought in a gorgeous palanquin from the present temple to the old temple seven times in a year to commemorate the ancient rituals. The idol of the deity is ceremoniously installed on the old throne where she had been worshiped for centuries. A male goat was traditionally sacrificed at the old temple in a [[panchayatana puja]] as the last ritual during the festival of [[Dussehra]]. The new year festival, [[Pana Sankranti]], is the most important festival, when devotees dance on fire to complete their vow to the goddess.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@piyushrout/jhamu-jatra-once-a-village-festival-now-a-city-culture-f14da3f21e34|title=Jhamu Jatra once a Village Festival now a City Culture|last=ROUT|first=PIYUSH|date=2017-04-15|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>  The festival of [[Dol Purnima]] is also observed with pomp and ceremony. At this festival Goddess Sarala is worshipped along with other deities, signifying that Maa Sarala is an amalgamation of parts of the [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavic]] traditions.\n\nThe present temple was constructed during the [[Maratha Empire]], between 1753 and 1803.  In 1863 the [[Law Commission of India]] passed the Religious Endowments Act, bringing many religious establishments under the control of the government for the first time in the history of India. The Act provided for trustees selected by the local District Judge to administer the Temple. Although there were many positive provisions in the Act, a significant flaw was that trustees were appointed for life. As the Sarala Temple was inconveniently located, it quickly became neglected.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 1928, following complaints about the mismanagement of the temple, the [[Cuttack]] District Judge nominated Ray Bahadur Chintamani Acharya and Choudhury Brajanath Mishra of Veda village as members of the Board of Trustees of the Sarala Temple. Acharya and Mishra improved the administration of the temple significantly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} In particular, Acharya developed a system to allow donations of pilgrims to be used directly by the Temple, including a method for sharing donations with local hereditary administrators. He was later able to create a by-law for the temple that abolished the corrupt hereditary administration entirely. In 1939 the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act came into force and the responsibility of appointing trustees was transferred from the District Judge to an Endowment Commissioner. Trustees are appointed for five-year terms.\n\n===Location and accommodation===\nThe temple is 20 minutes by road from Jagatsinghpur district headquarters. The nearest airport is [[Bhubaneshwar]], which is approximately 80&nbsp;km away. The nearest railway station is [[Cuttack Railway Station]].  The temple is well served by buses from Cuttack. The Roads and Building (R&B) Department of the Government of Odisha maintains a facility for overnight accommodation. The Water Resources Department also maintains a rest house near the temple.\n\n==Religious history==\nTantric [[Shaktism]] began in the 7th century. Shaktism holds that the mother goddess (Matrushakti) is the source of power and of highest spiritual bliss. During the early Bhaumakar rule, in 736 A.D, the eight-armed Mahinsamardini Durga appeared in the sculptural masterpieces of Odisha. Some eight-armed Mahinsamardini idols found in other parts of Odisha in the 8th century resembled the Goddess Sarala. Archaeologists and scholars have concluded that the worship of the Goddess Sarala in Jhankad began during the 8th century CE.\n\nThe worship of the goddess was popularized in the 15th century CE by the work of Sidheshwar Parida, a small-time farmer and part-time Oriya ''[[Paika]]''. He was an ardent follower of the goddess, and later took the name [[Sarala Das]], the servant of Maa Sarala. He became the foremost poet of Oriya literature, composing the great epics [[Oriya language|Oriya]] ''[[Mahabharata]], Bilanka Ramayan, Chandipuran and Laxminarayan bachanika''.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>  He attributed the composition of these works to divine inspiration by the goddess.\n\n===Tantric culture===\nIn the Oriya Mahabharata, the Goddess Sarala was popularly known as \u2018Sarola [[Chandi]]\u2019. The worship of the goddess Sarala derives from the worship of Chandi in the [[Markandeya Purana]]. As described in the text, the goddess possesses Shiva's trident, Vishnu's Chakra, Vayu's bow, Surya's arrow, Vishwakarma's Axe. Indra's thunder, Ayiravata's bell and Himavan's Lion. Sacred verses of this text are chanted at the Shrine daily.\n\nTantric rituals are still in practice from time immemorial, including the daily offering of coconut water, cakes made of [[blackgram]] and different kinds of [[rice]]. Dancers also pay tribute to the goddess in the ghata nrutya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/odisha/cuttack-swings-to-old-new-beats-day-2-at-mahanadi-festival-sees-both-traditional-and-modern-dance/cid/408631|title=Cuttack swings to old & new beats - Day 2 at Mahanadi festival sees both traditional and modern dance|last=Vikash|first=Sharma|date=April 20, 2011|website=www.telegraphindia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> In the past, animal sacrifices were made on the occasion of [[Durga Ashtami|Maha Ashtami]], another tantric practice. The features present in the image of the goddess reflect an amalgamation of [[Matangi]] and [[Mahishamardini]].\n\n===Attribution of entity as Saraswati===\nThe aspect of the goddess Sarala known as [[V\u0101c]] devi is the eternal source of all wisdom, intelligence and inspiration. She personifies \u201c[[Brahmavidya]]\u201d, the mystic knowledge of the absolute. She is also known as [[Utkal]] Bharati, where Utkal signifies the state of Odisha and Bharati is one of the epithets of [[Saraswati]] and Tantrik [[Matangi]], and Sharada, to signify that the substance of life and the power of knowledge are given by the goddess.\n\n===Legendary origin===\nIn one legend, the goddess's origins date back to the sixth incarnation of [[Vishnu]], [[Parashurama]] the Brahmin warrior. During his travels, Parashurama swam in the river Chandrabhaga and took a rest under a banyan tree. While meditating, he became aware of a power (Shakti) that had been hidden and desired to have self-expression. He recovered a shining stone (Parasmanisila), a form of glittering basalt, from underneath the earth and carved the divine image of the goddess with his arrow. The goddess was named Sarada, since her image was carved out by the arrow (Sara) of Parasurama.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nIn another legend, [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]], the original source of power and the wife of [[Shiva]], caused herself to be sacrificed in the fireplace because she could not tolerate humiliation of her husband by her father, [[Daksha]]. Out of grief and remorse, Lord Shiva started roaming relentlessly, holding her corpse on his shoulder. Fearing that the anger of Shiva might be detrimental for mankind, Lord Vishnu sliced her body into pieces using his great weapon wheel (the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]) and scattered pieces of her body over 51 places. Around each place where a part of her body landed there grew up a sacred place of worship of the mother goddess. According to the legend, the tongue of Sati fell in Jhankada.\n\n==Festivals==\n''Maha Visuba [[Pana Sankranti]]'': Some of the rituals performed at the temple are an amalgamation of the practices of different influential sects that have been adapted in the temple over a period of time. The Maha Visuba [[Pana Sankranti]] (Jhamu Yatra), otherwise known as the \u201cfire-walking festival\u201d is one of the important festivals of the goddess. Sudra Sevaks belonging to the Roul caste wear picturesque costumes and dance bare-footed over burning charcoals. Some of the participants subsequently tour the nearby villages for nearly one month to spread the magnanimity of the goddess.<ref>[http://www.maasarala.org/festival.html www.maasarala.org: festival]</ref>\n\n''[[Durga Puja]]'': In the autumn, the Durga Puja is observed from Mulastami to Mahastami.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/sep/15/shodasa-puja-of-sarala-begins-1657542.html|title=Shodasa Puja of Sarala begins|date=September 15, 2017|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> This is one of the greatest festivals in the Devi Peetha. Mahinsa Mardini Besa, Suna Besa and Kalika Nrutya are among the main attractions of the festival. Sodasa Upachara [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] takes place twice daily during this period. In the past, a buffalo was sacrificed on the prescribed day Mahastami ([[Durga Puja|Sandhipuja]]), and a male goat sacrifice was performed before the ceremonial idol of the goddess on the day of Dussehra at the old shrine of the deity Sarola Grama.\n\n''[[Chandan Yatra]]'''':'' Chandan Yatra begins on [[Akshaya Tritiya]] and is observed for 21 days. It is a unique festival of the Shakta Shrine as the deity is worshiped here as Parama Vaishnavi. In the text of Oriya Mahabharata Sarala Thakurani is described as Parama Vaishnavi.\n\n''[[Nabanna]]'' ''Puja:'' The Nabanna occurs at the time of Odisha's harvesting season, in the first week of [[Agrahayana]]. Different types of foods are prepared for the deity, from the newly harvested crops and offered to the deity through Sodasa Upachara Puja.\n\nMany of the rituals show an influence of Jagannath culture and Vasihnavism. For example, in the Gamha Avisek the processional idol of the goddess is taken nine times round the temple, similar to the tradition at the Sri Jaganath Temple Puri. In accordance with Jagannath culture, Suniya in the month of Bhadrav is observed as a coronation ceremony of the Gajapati kings.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Shakti temples in Odisha}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Jagatsinghpur district]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox Mandir\n|name                 = Maa Sarala Temple\n|image                = Sarala Temple Small.JPG\n|caption              =\n|map_type             = Odisha\n|coordinates          = {{coord|20.279695|86.293658|type:landmark_region:IN-OR|display=inline,title}}\n|coordinates_footnotes=\n|map_caption          = Odisha\n|other_names          =\n|sanskrit_translit    =\n|script_name          = <!--Enter name of local script used-->\n|script               = <!--Enter the template name in the local script used -->\n|country              = [[India]]\n|state                = [[Odisha]]\n|district             = [[Jagatsinghpur]]\n|locale               =\n|elevation_m          =\n|elevation_footnotes  =\n|deity                =\n|festivals            =\n|temple_quantity      =\n|monument_quantity    =\n|inscriptions         =\n|year_completed       =\n|creator              =\n|temple_board         =\n|website              =\n}}\nThe '''Maa Sarala Temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] in the district of [[Jagatsinghpur]], [[Odisha]], [[India]]<ref>https://jagatsinghpur.nic.in/tourist-place/maa-sarala/</ref>.

The new year festival, [[Pana Sankranti]], is the most important festival, when devotees dance on fire to complete their vow to the goddess.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@piyushrout/jhamu-jatra-once-a-village-festival-now-a-city-culture-f14da3f21e34|title=Jhamu Jatra once a Village Festival now a City Culture|last=ROUT|first=PIYUSH|date=2017-04-15|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>  The festival of [[Dol Purnima]] is also observed with pomp and ceremony. At this festival Goddess Sarala is worshipped along with other deities, signifying that Maa Sarala is an amalgamation of parts of the [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavic]] traditions.\n\nThe present temple was constructed during the [[Maratha Empire]], between 1753 and 1803.  In 1863 the [[Law Commission of India]] passed the Religious Endowments Act, bringing many religious establishments under the control of the government for the first time in the history of India. The Act provided for trustees selected by the local District Judge to administer the Temple. Although there were many positive provisions in the Act, a significant flaw was that trustees were appointed for life. As the Sarala Temple was inconveniently located, it quickly became neglected.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 1928, following complaints about the mismanagement of the temple, the [[Cuttack]] District Judge nominated Ray Bahadur Chintamani Acharya and Choudhury Brajanath Mishra of Veda village as members of the Board of Trustees of the Sarala Temple. Acharya and Mishra improved the administration of the temple significantly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} In particular, Acharya developed a system to allow donations of pilgrims to be used directly by the Temple, including a method for sharing donations with local hereditary administrators. He was later able to create a by-law for the temple that abolished the corrupt hereditary administration entirely. In 1939 the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act came into force and the responsibility of appointing trustees was transferred from the District Judge to an Endowment Commissioner. Trustees are appointed for five-year terms.\n\n===Location and accommodation===\nThe temple is 20 minutes by road from Jagatsinghpur district headquarters. The nearest airport is [[Bhubaneshwar]], which is approximately 80&nbsp;km away. The nearest railway station is [[Cuttack Railway Station]].  The temple is well served by buses from Cuttack. The Roads and Building (R&B) Department of the Government of Odisha maintains a facility for overnight accommodation. The Water Resources Department also maintains a rest house near the temple.\n\n==Religious history==\nTantric [[Shaktism]] began in the 7th century. Shaktism holds that the mother goddess (Matrushakti) is the source of power and of highest spiritual bliss. During the early Bhaumakar rule, in 736 A.D, the eight-armed Mahinsamardini Durga appeared in the sculptural masterpieces of Odisha. Some eight-armed Mahinsamardini idols found in other parts of Odisha in the 8th century resembled the Goddess Sarala. Archaeologists and scholars have concluded that the worship of the Goddess Sarala in Jhankad began during the 8th century CE.\n\nThe worship of the goddess was popularized in the 15th century CE by the work of Sidheshwar Parida, a small-time farmer and part-time Oriya ''[[Paika]]''. He was an ardent follower of the goddess, and later took the name [[Sarala Das]], the servant of Maa Sarala. He became the foremost poet of Oriya literature, composing the great epics [[Oriya language|Oriya]] ''[[Mahabharata]], Bilanka Ramayan, Chandipuran and Laxminarayan bachanika''.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>  He attributed the composition of these works to divine inspiration by the goddess.\n\n===Tantric culture===\nIn the Oriya Mahabharata, the Goddess Sarala was popularly known as \u2018Sarola [[Chandi]]\u2019. The worship of the goddess Sarala derives from the worship of Chandi in the [[Markandeya Purana]]. As described in the text, the goddess possesses Shiva\u2019s trident, Vishnu\u2019s Chakra, Vayu\u2019s bow, Surya\u2019s arrow, Vishwakarma\u2019s Axe. Indra\u2019s thunder, Ayiravata\u2019s bell and Himavan\u2019s Lion. Sacred verses of this text are chanted at the Shrine daily.\n\nTantric rituals are still in practice from time immemorial, including the daily offering of coconut water, cakes made of [[blackgram]] and different kinds of [[rice]]. Dancers also pay tribute to the goddess in the ghata nrutya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/odisha/cuttack-swings-to-old-new-beats-day-2-at-mahanadi-festival-sees-both-traditional-and-modern-dance/cid/408631|title=Cuttack swings to old & new beats - Day 2 at Mahanadi festival sees both traditional and modern dance|last=Vikash|first=Sharma|date=April 20, 2011|website=www.telegraphindia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> In the past, animal sacrifices were made on the occasion of [[Durga Ashtami|Maha Ashtami]], another tantric practice. The features present in the image of the goddess reflect an amalgamation of [[Matangi]] and [[Mahishamardini]].\n\n===Attribution of entity as Saraswati===\nThe aspect of the goddess Sarala known as [[V\u0101c]] devi is the eternal source of all wisdom, intelligence and inspiration. She personifies \u201c[[Brahmavidya]]\u201d, the mystic knowledge of the absolute. She is also known as [[Utkal]] Bharati, where Utkal signifies the state of Odisha and Bharati is one of the epithets of [[Saraswati]] and Tantrik [[Matangi]], and Sharada, to signify that the substance of life and the power of knowledge are given by the goddess. \n\n===Legendary origin===\nIn one legend, the goddess's origins date back to the sixth incarnation of [[Lord Vishnu]], [[Parashurama]] the Brahmin warrior. During his travels, Parashurama swam in the river Chandrabhaga and took a rest under a banyan tree. While meditating, he became aware of a power (Shakti) that had been hidden and desired to have self-expression. He recovered a shining stone (Parasmanisila), a form of glittering basalt, from underneath the earth and carved the divine image of the goddess with his arrow. The goddess was named Sarada, since her image was carved out by the arrow (Sara) of Parasurama.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nIn another legend, [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]], the original source of power and the wife of [[Lord Shiva]], caused herself to be sacrificed in the fireplace because she could not tolerate humiliation of her husband by her father, [[Daksha]]. Out of grief and remorse, Lord Shiva started roaming relentlessly, holding her corpse on his shoulder. Fearing that the anger of Shiva might be detrimental for mankind, Lord Vishnu sliced her body into pieces using his great weapon wheel (the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]) and scattered pieces of her body over 51 places. Around each place where a part of her body landed there grew up a sacred place of worship of the mother goddess. According to the legend, the tongue of Sati fell in Jhankada.\n\n==Festivals==\n''Maha Visuba [[Pana Sankranti]]'': Some of the rituals performed at the temple are an amalgamation of the practices of different influential sects that have been adapted in the temple over a period of time. The Maha Visuba [[Pana Sankranti]] (Jhamu Yatra), otherwise known as the \u201cfire-walking festival\u201d is one of the important festivals of the goddess. Sudra Sevaks belonging to the Roul caste wear picturesque costumes and dance bare-footed over burning charcoals. Some of the participants subsequently tour the nearby villages for nearly one month to spread the magnanimity of the goddess.<ref>[http://www.maasarala.org/festival.html www.maasarala.org: festival]</ref>\n\n''[[Durga Puja]]'': In the autumn, the Durga Puja is observed from Mulastami to Mahastami.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/sep/15/shodasa-puja-of-sarala-begins-1657542.html|title=Shodasa Puja of Sarala begins|date=September 15, 2017|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> This is one of the greatest festivals in the Devi Peetha. Mahinsa Mardini Besa, Suna Besa and Kalika Nrutya are among the main attractions of the festival. Sodasa Upachara [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] takes place twice daily during this period. In the past, a buffalo was sacrificed on the prescribed day Mahastami ([[Durga Puja|Sandhipuja]]), and a male goat sacrifice was performed before the ceremonial idol of the goddess on the day of Dussehra at the old shrine of the deity Sarola Grama.\n\n''[[Chandan Yatra]]'''':'' Chandan Yatra begins on [[Akshaya Tritiya]] and is observed for 21 days. It is a unique festival of the Shakta Shrine as the deity is worshiped here as Parama Vaishnavi. In the text of Oriya Mahabharata Sarala Thakurani is described as Parama Vaishnavi.\n\n''[[Nabanna]]'' ''Puja:'' The Nabanna occurs at the time of Odisha\u2019s harvesting season, in the first week of [[Agrahayana]]. Different types of foods are prepared for the deity, from the newly harvested crops and offered to the deity through Sodasa Upachara Puja.\n\nMany of the rituals show an influence of Jagannath culture and Vasihnavism. For example in the Gamha Avisek the processional idol of the goddess is taken nine times round the temple, similar to the tradition at the Sri Jaganath Temple Puri. In accordance with Jagannath culture, Suniya in the month of Bhadrav is observed as a coronation ceremony of the Gajapati kings.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Shakti temples in Odisha}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Jagatsinghpur district]]\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: For example \u2192 For example,, \u2019s \u2192 's (9)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarala_Temple"}

It refers to a [[yajna]] (sacrifice) organized by [[Daksha]], where his daughter [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] immolated herself. The wrath of god [[Shiva]], Sati's husband, thereafter destroyed the sacrifice. The tale is also called '''Daksha-Yajna-Nasha''' (\"destruction of Daksha's sacrifice). The story forms the basis of the establishment of the [[Shakti Peetha]]s, temples of the Hindu Divine Mother. It is also becomes a prelude to the story of [[Parvati]], Sati's reincarnation who later marries Shiva.\n\nThe mythology is mainly told in the ''[[Vayu Purana]]''. It is also mentioned in the ''Kasi Kanda'' of the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', the ''[[Kurma Purana]]'', ''[[Harivamsa|Harivamsa Purana]]'' and ''[[Padma Purana]]''. ''[[Linga Purana]]'', ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', and ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' also detail the incident.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Sati-Shiva marriage===\n[[Daksha]] was one of the [[Prajapati]], son of [[Brahma]], and among his foremost creations. The name ''Daksha'' means \"skilled one\". Daksha had two wives: Prasoothi and Panchajani (Virini). [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] (also known as \u2018\u2018Uma\u2019\u2019) was his youngest daughter; born from Virini (the daughter of the Prajapati [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]), she was the pet child of Daksha and he always carried her with him. Sati (meaning truth) is also called Dakshayani as she followed Daksha\u2019s path; this is derived from the Sanskrit words ''daksha'' and ''ayana'' (walk or path).<ref name=\"Siva Purana\">{{cite book|title=Siva: The Siva Purana Retold|year=2011|publisher=Rupa and Co|isbn=978-8129114952|author=Ramesh Menon|edition=1, Fourth Re-print}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/l |title=The list of Hindu sacred books |publisher=John Bruno Hare |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-07-23 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/>\n\n[[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the youngest daughter of [[Daksha]],<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/> was deeply in love with the god [[Shiva]] and wished to become his wife. Her worship and devotion of Shiva strengthened her immense desire to become his wife. However, Daksha did not like his daughter\u2019s yearning for Shiva, mainly because he was a [[Prajapati]] and the son of the god [[Brahma]]; his daughter Sati was a royal princess. They were wealthy nobility and their imperial royal lifestyle was entirely different from that of Shiva. As an emperor, Daksha wanted to increase his influence and power by making marriage alliances with powerful empires and influential sages and gods.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/>\n\nShiva, on the other hand, led a very modest life. He lived among the downtrodden, wore a tiger skin, smeared ashes on his body, had thick locks of matted hair, and begged with a skull as bowl. His abode was Mount [[Kailash]] in the [[Himalayas]]. He embraced all kinds of living beings and did not make any distinction between good souls and bad souls. The [[Gana|Bhutaganas]], his followers, consisted of all kinds of ghosts, demons, ghouls and goblins. He wandered through garden and graveyard alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naturallyyoga.com/files/shiva_sati.htm |title=If one is hurt by the arrows of an enemy, one is not as aggrieved as when cut by the unkind words of a relative, for such grief continues to rend one's heart day and night |publisher=Naturallyyoga.com |accessdate=2014-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801215211/http://www.naturallyyoga.com/files/shiva_sati.htm |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><br /> As a consequence, Daksha had aversion towards Shiva being his daughter\u2019s companion.

Despite Daksha's disappointment, Sati married Shiva.\n\n===Brahma's yajna===\n[[File:Daksha criticizing Rudra for insulting him in the Satrayaga.jpg|thumb|Daksha criticizing Rudra for insulting him in the Satrayaga]]\nOnce Brahma conducted a huge [[yajna]] (sacrifice), where all the Prajapatis, gods and kings of the world were invited. Shiva and Sati were also called on to participate in the yajna. All of them came for the yajna and sat in the ceremonial place. Daksha came last.

Daksha misunderstood Shiva\u2019s gesture and considered Shiva's gesture as an insult. Daksha vowed to take revenge on the insult in the same manner.<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/>\n\n==Ceremony==\nDaksha\u2019s grudge towards Shiva grew after Brahma's yajna. With the prime motive of insulting Shiva, Daksha initiated a great yajna, similar to that of Brahma. The yajna was to be presided over by the sage [[Bhrigu]]. He invited all the gods, Prajapatis and kings to attend the yajna and intentionally avoided inviting Shiva and Sati.<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/><ref name=\"Malayala Manorama News\"/>\n\n===Dadhichi-Daksha argument===\nThe Kurma Purana discusses the dialogues between the sage [[Dadhichi]] and Daksha. After the sacrifice and hymns were offered to the twelve [[Aditya]] gods; Dadhichi noticed that there was no sacrificial portion (''Havvis'') allotted to Shiva and his wife, and no Vedic hymns were used in the yajna addressing Shiva which were part of Vedic hymns. He warned Daksha that he should not alter the Holy Vedas for personal reasons; the priests and sages supported this. Daksha replied to Dadhichi that he would not do so and insulted Shiva. Dadhichi left the yajna because of this argument.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\n===Sati's death===\n[[File:Kottiyoor temple festival IMG 9526.JPG|thumb|[[Ammarakkallu]]-The spot where Sati immolated herself, [[Kottiyoor]].]]\nSati came to know about the grand yajna organized by her father and asked Shiva to attend the yajna. Shiva refused her request, saying that it was inappropriate to attend a function without being invited. He reminded her that she was now his wife more than Daksha\u2019s daughter and, after marriage, is a member of Shiva\u2019s family rather than Daksha\u2019s. The feeling of her bond to her parents overpowered the social etiquette she had to follow. She even had a notion that there was no need to have received an invitation in order to attend as she was Daksha\u2019s favourite daughter and no formality existed between them. She constantly pleaded and urged Shiva to let her attend the ceremony, and became adamant in her demands without listening to the reasons Shiva provided for not attending the function. He allowed Sati to go to her parents' home, along with his followers including [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], and attend the ceremony, but refused to accompany with her.<ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/>\n\nUpon arriving, Sati tried to meet her parents and sisters; Daksha was arrogant and avoided interacting with Sati. He repeatedly snubbed her in front of all the dignitaries but Sati maintained her composure. Because of Sati\u2019s persistence in trying to meet him, Daksha reacted vehemently, insulting her in front of all the other guests at the ceremony to which she had not been invited. He called Shiva an atheist and cremation ground dweller. As planned, he took advantage of the situation and continued shouting repugnant words against Shiva. Sati felt deep remorse for not listening to her beloved husband. Daksha\u2019s disdain towards her, and especially her husband Shiva, in front of all the guests was growing each moment she stood there. The shameless insult and humiliation of her and her beloved, eventually became too much to bear.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sivapurana.blogspot.in/2009/06/birth-of-sati.htmll |title=Lord Shiva stories, Shiva purana |publisher=Sivaporana.blogspot.in |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\nShe cursed Daksha for acting so atrociously toward her and Shiva, and reminded him that his haughty behavior had blinded his intellect.

The invitees renounced the yajna and started running away from the turmoil. Sage Bhrigu created an army with his divine penance powers to resist Shiva\u2019s attack and protect the yajna. Bhrigu\u2019s army was demolished and the entire premises were ravaged. All those who participated, even the other Prajapatis and the gods, were mercilessly beaten, wounded or even slaughtered.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/> The ''Vayu Purana'' mentions the attack of Bhutaganas: the nose of some goddesses were cut, [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]]'s staff bone was broken, [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]'s eyes were pulled out, [[Indra]] was trampled by Virabhadra and Bhutaganas, [[Pushan]]'s teeth were knocked out, [[Chandra]] was beaten heavily, all of the Prajapatis' were beaten, the hands of Vahini were cut off, and Bhrigu's beard was cut off.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\nDaksha was caught and decapitated, the attack culminated when the Bhutaganas started plucking out Bhrigu\u2019s white beard as a victory souvenir.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/> The ''Vayu Purana'' do not mention the decapitation of Daksha, instead it says [[Yajna (avatar)|Yagnja]], the personification of yajna took the form of an antelope and jumped towards the sky. Virabhadra captured it and decapitated Yagnja. Daksha begs mercy from the [[Parabrahman]] (the Supreme Almighty who is formless), who rose from the yajna fire and forgives Daksha. The Parabharman informs Daksha that Shiva is in fact a manifestation of Parabrahman. Daksha then becomes a great devotee of Shiva. The ''Linga Purana'' and ''[[Bhagavatha Purana]]'' mention the decapitation of Daksha.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\nCertain other puranas like ''Harivamsa'', ''Kurma'', and ''Skanda'' narrate the story from the perspective of the Vishnava-Shaiva community feud prevalent in ancient times. In these puranas, there are fights between Vishnu and Shiva or Virabhadra, with various victors throughout. The story of Daksha Yaga in ''Vaishnava'' and ''Shaiva'' puranas end with the surrendering of Daksha to the Parabrahman or with the destruction of yajna and decapitation of Daksha.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dakshayani.jpg|thumbnail|[[Shiva]] wandering around holding [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s corpse]]\nAs the obstruction of the yajna will create havoc and severe ill effects on the nature, Brahma and the god [[Vishnu]] went to the grief-stricken Shiva. They comforted and showed their sympathy towards Shiva. They requested him to come to the yajna location and pacify the bhutaganas and allow the yaga to be completed; Shiva agreed. Shiva found the burnt body of Sati. Shiva gave permission to continue yajna. Daksha was absolved by Shiva and the head of a ram (Male goat) was fixed on the decapitated body of Daksha and gave his life back.

Shiva was so distressed and could not part from his beloved wife. He took the corpse of Sati and wandered around the universe. To reduce Shiva's grief, Vishnu cuts Sati's corpse as per Vaishnava Puranas; whose parts fell on the places Shiva wandered. The Shaiva version says that her body disintegrated on its own and the parts fell while Shiva was carrying Sati's corpse in various places. These places commemorating each body part came to be known as the [[Shakti peethas]]. There are 51 Shakti peethas, representing the 51 letters of [[Sanskrit]].<ref name=\"devibhagavatham\"/> Some of the puranas which came in later ages gave more importance to their supreme deity (depending on Vaishnava, Shaiva, and Shakta sects) in their literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are Puranas?

Shakti Peethas are sacred abodes of [[Devi]]. These shrines are located all over South Asia. Most of the temples are located in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]; there are a few shrines in [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. There are 51 Shakti Peethas as per the puranas denoting the 51 Sanskrit alphabets.<ref>{{cite book|title=Travels Through Sacred India|year=1996|publisher=Thorsons|isbn=1855384973|author=Roger Housden|edition=1}}</ref> However 52, and 108 are also believed to exist. Shakti Peethas are the revered temples of the Shakta ([[Shaktism]]) sect of [[Hinduism]].

It refers to a [[yajna]] (sacrifice) organized by [[Daksha]], where his daughter [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] immolated herself. The wrath of god [[Shiva]], Sati's husband, thereafter destroyed the sacrifice. The tale is also called '''Daksha-Yajna-Nasha''' (\"destruction of Daksha's sacrifice). The story forms the basis of the establishment of the [[Shakti Peetha]]s, temples of the Hindu Divine Mother. It is also becomes a prelude to the story of [[Parvati]], Sati's reincarnation who later marries Shiva.\n\nThe mythology is mainly told in the ''[[Vayu Purana]]''. It is also mentioned in the ''Kasi Kanda'' of the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', the ''[[Kurma Purana]]'', ''[[Harivamsa|Harivamsa Purana]]'' and ''[[Padma Purana]]''. ''[[Linga Purana]]'', ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', and ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' also detail the incident.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Sati-Shiva marriage===\n[[Daksha]] was one of the [[Prajapati]], son of [[Brahma]], and among his foremost creations. The name ''Daksha'' means \"skilled one\". Daksha had two wives: Prasoothi and Panchajani (Virini). [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] (also known as \u2018\u2018Uma\u2019\u2019) was his youngest daughter; born from Virini (the daughter of the Prajapati [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]), she was the pet child of Daksha and he always carried her with him. Sati (meaning truth) is also called Dakshayani as she followed Daksha\u2019s path; this is derived from the Sanskrit words ''daksha'' and ''ayana'' (walk or path).<ref name=\"Siva Purana\">{{cite book|title=Siva: The Siva Purana Retold|year=2011|publisher=Rupa and Co|isbn=978-8129114952|author=Ramesh Menon|edition=1, Fourth Re-print}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/l |title=The list of Hindu sacred books |publisher=John Bruno Hare |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-07-23 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/>\n\n[[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the youngest daughter of [[Daksha]],<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/> was deeply in love with the god [[Shiva]] and wished to become his wife. Her worship and devotion of Shiva strengthened her immense desire to become his wife. However, Daksha did not like his daughter\u2019s yearning for Shiva, mainly because he was a [[Prajapati]] and the son of the god [[Brahma]]; his daughter Sati was a royal princess. They were wealthy nobility and their imperial royal lifestyle was entirely different from that of Shiva. As an emperor, Daksha wanted to increase his influence and power by making marriage alliances with powerful empires and influential sages and gods.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/>\n\nShiva on the other hand led a very modest life. He lived among the downtrodden, wore a tiger skin, smeared ashes on his body, had thick locks of matted hair, and begged with a skull as bowl. His abode was Mount [[Kailash]] in the [[Himalayas]]. He embraced all kinds of living beings and did not make any distinction between good souls and bad souls. The [[Gana|Bhutaganas]], his followers, consisted of all kinds of ghosts, demons, ghouls and goblins. He wandered though garden and graveyard alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naturallyyoga.com/files/shiva_sati.htm |title=If one is hurt by the arrows of an enemy, one is not as aggrieved as when cut by the unkind words of a relative, for such grief continues to rend one's heart day and night |publisher=Naturallyyoga.com |accessdate=2014-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801215211/http://www.naturallyyoga.com/files/shiva_sati.htm |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><br /> As a consequence, Daksha had aversion towards Shiva being his daughter\u2019s companion.

Despite Daksha's disappointment, Sati married Shiva.\n\n===Brahma's yajna===\n[[File:Daksha criticizing Rudra for insulting him in the Satrayaga.jpg|thumb|Daksha criticizing Rudra for insulting him in the Satrayaga]]\nOnce Brahma conducted a huge [[yajna]] (sacrifice), where all the Prajapatis, gods and kings of the world were invited. Shiva and Sati were also called on to participate in the yajna. All of them came for the yajna and sat in the ceremonial place. Daksha came last.

Daksha misunderstood Shiva\u2019s gesture and considered Shiva's gesture as an insult. Daksha vowed to take revenge on the insult in the same manner.<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/>\n\n==Ceremony==\nDaksha\u2019s grudge towards Shiva grew after Brahma's yajna. With the prime motive of insulting Shiva, Daksha initiated a great yajna, similar to that of Brahma. The yajna was to be presided over by the sage [[Bhrigu]]. He invited all the gods, Prajapatis and kings to attend the yajna and intentionally avoided inviting Shiva and Sati.<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/><ref name=\"Malayala Manorama News\"/>\n\n===Dadhichi-Daksha argument===\nThe Kurma Purana discusses the dialogues between the sage [[Dadhichi]] and Daksha. After the sacrifice and hymns where offered to the twelve [[Aditya]] gods; Dadhichi noticed that there was no sacrificial portion (''Havvis'') allotted to Shiva and his wife, and no vedic hymns were used in the yajna addressing Shiva which were part of Vedic hymns. He warned Daksha that he should not alter the Holy Vedas for personal reasons; the priests and sages supported this. Daksha replied to Dadhichi that he would not do so and insulted Shiva. Dadhichi left the yajna because of this argument.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\n===Sati's death===\n[[File:Kottiyoor temple festival IMG 9526.JPG|thumb|[[Ammarakkallu]]-The spot where Sati immolated herself, [[Kottiyoor]].]]\nSati came to know about the grand yajna organized by her father and asked Shiva to attend the yajna. Shiva refused her request, saying that it was inappropriate to attend a function without being invited. He reminded her that she was now his wife more than Daksha\u2019s daughter and, after marriage, is a member of Shiva\u2019s family rather than Daksha\u2019s. The feeling of her bond to her parents overpowered the social etiquette she had to follow. She even had a notion that there was no need to have received an invitation in order to attend as she was Daksha\u2019s favourite daughter and no formality existed between them. She constantly pleaded and urged Shiva to let her attend the ceremony, and became adamant in her demands without listening to the reasons Shiva provided for not attending the function. He allowed Sati to go to her parents' home, along with his followers including [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], and attend the ceremony, but refused to accompany with her.<ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/>\n\nUpon arriving, Sati tried to meet her parents and sisters; Daksha was arrogant and avoided interacting with Sati. He repeatedly snubbed her in front of all the dignitaries but Sati maintained her composure. Because of Sati\u2019s persistence in trying to meet him, Daksha reacted vehemently, insulting her in front of all the other guests at the ceremony to which she had not been invited. He called Shiva an atheist and cremation ground dweller. As planned, he took advantage of the situation and continued shouting repugnant words against Shiva. Sati felt deep remorse for not listening to her beloved husband. Daksha\u2019s disdain towards her, and especially her husband Shiva, in front of all the guests was growing each moment she stood there. The shameless insult and humiliation of her and her beloved, eventually became too much to bear.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sivapurana.blogspot.in/2009/06/birth-of-sati.htmll |title=Lord Shiva stories, Shiva purana |publisher=Sivaporana.blogspot.in |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\nShe cursed Daksha for acting so atrociously toward her and Shiva, and reminded him that his haughty behavior had blinded his intellect. She cursed him and warned that the wrath of Shiva would destroy him and his empire. Unable to bear further humiliation, Sati committed suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" /><ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Malayala Manorama News\"/> The onlookers tried to save her but it was too late.<ref name=\"Skanda Purana\"/> They were only able to retrieve the half burnt body of Sati. Daksha's pride in being a Prajapati and his prejudice against his son-in-law created a mass hatred within himself, which resulted in the death of his daughter.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/>\n\nThe Nandi and the accompanying Bhootaganas left the yajna place after the incident. Nandi cursed the participants and Bhrigu reacted by cursing the Bhootaganas back.\n\n===Destruction of the yajna by Shiva===\n[[File:Virabhadra Daksha.jpg|thumbnail|[[Virabhadra]] and [[Daksha]]]]\n[[File:Shiva appeared in Daksha yagna.jpg|thumb|Shiva appears as Parabrahma in the scene from the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\nShiva was deeply pained upon hearing of his wife's death. His grief grew into a terrible anger when he realized how Daksha had viciously plotted a treachery against him; but it was his innocent wife who fell into the trap instead of him. Shiva learned of Daksha\u2019s callous behavior towards Sati. Shiva's rage became so intense that he plucked a lock of hair from his head and smashed it on the ground, breaking it into two with his leg.

Shiva ordered them to kill Daksha and destroy the yajna.<ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/>\n\nThe ferocious Virabhadra and Bhadrakali, along with the Bhutaganas, reached the yajna spot. The invitees renounced the yajna and started running away from the turmoil. Sage Bhrigu created an army with his divine penance powers to resist Shiva\u2019s attack and protect the yajna. Bhrigu\u2019s army was demolished and the entire premises were ravaged. All those who participated, even the other Prajapatis and the gods, were mercilessly beaten, wounded or even slaughtered.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/> The ''Vayu Purana'' mentions the attack of Bhutaganas: the nose of some goddesses were cut, [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]]'s staff bone was broken, [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]'s eyes were pulled out, [[Indra]] was trampled by Virabhadra and Bhutaganas, [[Pushan]]'s teeth were knocked out, [[Chandra]] was beaten heavily, all of the Prajapatis' were beaten, the hands of Vahini were cut off, and Bhrigu's beard was cut off.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\nDaksha was caught and decapitated, the attack culminated when the Bhutaganas started plucking out Bhrigu\u2019s white beard as a victory souvenir.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"Kanchi_Madom\"/> The ''Vayu Purana'' do not mention the decapitation of Daksha, instead it says [[Yajna (avatar)|Yagnja]], the personification of yajna took the form of an antelope and jumped towards the sky. Virabhadra captured it and decapitated Yagnja. Daksha begs mercy from the [[Parabrahman]] (the Supreme Almighty who is formless), who rose from the yajna fire and forgives Daksha. The Parabharman informs Daksha that Shiva is in fact a manifestation of Parabrahman. Daksha then becomes a great devotee of Shiva. The ''Linga Purana'' and ''[[Bhagavatha Purana]]'' mention the decapitation of Daksha.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\nCertain other puranas like ''Harivamsa'', ''Kurma'', and ''Skanda'' narrate the story from the perspective of the Vishnava-Shaiva community feud prevalent in ancient times. In these puranas, there are fights between Vishnu and Shiva or Virabhadra, with various victors throughout. The story of Daksha Yaga in ''Vaishnava'' and ''Shaiva'' puranas end with the surrendering of Daksha to the Parabrahman or with the destruction of yajna and decapitation of Daksha.<ref name=\"Vaayu.P-Horace Hayman Wilson\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dakshayani.jpg|thumbnail|[[Shiva]] wandering around holding [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s corpse]]\nAs the obstruction of the yajna will create havoc and severe ill effects on the nature, Brahma and the god [[Vishnu]] went to the grief-stricken Shiva. They comforted and showed their sympathy towards Shiva. They requested him to come to the yajna location and pacify the bhutaganas and allow the yaga to be completed; Shiva agreed. Shiva found the burnt body of Sati. Shiva gave permission to continue yajna. Daksha was absolved by Shiva and the head of a ram (Male goat) was fixed on the decapitated body of Daksha and gave his life back. The yajna was completed successfully.<ref name=\"devibhagavatham\">{{cite book|last=(Translator)|first=Swami Vijnanananda|title=The Srimad Devi Bhagavatam|year=2007|publisher=Munshiram Maniharlal|isbn=978-8121505918}}</ref>\n\nThe later story is an epilogue to the story of Daksha yajna mentioned in Shakta Puranas like ''Devi Bhagavata Purana'', ''Kalika Purana'' and the folklores of various regions. Shiva was so distressed and could not part from his beloved wife. He took the corpse of Sati and wandered around the universe. To reduce Shiva's grief, Vishnu cuts Sati's corpse as per Vaishnava Puranas; whose parts fell on the places Shiva wandered. The Shaiva version says that her body disintegrated on its own and the parts fell while Shiva was carrying Sati's corpse in various places. These places commemorating each body part came to be known as the [[Shakti peethas]]. There are 51 Shakti peethas, representing the 51 letters of [[Sanskrit]].<ref name=\"devibhagavatham\"/> Some of the puranas which came in later ages gave more importance to their supreme deity (depending on Vaishnava, Shaiva, and Shakta sects) in their literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are Puranas?

Like Sati, Parvati took severe austerities and gave away all her royal privileges and went to forest. Shiva tested her affection and devotion in disguise. He eventually realized Parvati is Sati herself. Shiva later on married Parvati.<ref name=\"Siva Purana\"/><ref name=\"devibhagavatham\"/>\n\n==Shakti Peethas==\n{{main|Shakti Peethas}}\nThe mythology of Daksha Yaga is considered to be the story of origin of [[Shakti Peethas]]. Shakti Peethas are sacred abodes of [[Devi]]. These shrines are located all over South Asia. Most of the temples are located in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]; there are a few shrines in [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. There are 51 Shakti Peethas as per the puranas denoting the 51 Sanskrit alphabets.<ref>{{cite book|title=Travels Through Sacred India|year=1996|publisher=Thorsons|isbn=1855384973|author=Roger Housden|edition=1}}</ref> However 52, and 108 are also believed to exist.

indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref name=\"MC\"/> [[AllMusic]] described the album as \"deeply meditative, often implying or directly expressing sorrow regarding planetary afflictions rooted in fear,\" while maintaining Cherry's well-known \"defiant streak.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Music magazine ''The Muse'' called the album \"perhaps [Cherry's] strongest and most sophisticated \u2014 every bit as vivid, sensitive, and forward-thinking as Joni Mitchell was in the mid-\u201970s, \"and concluded, \"''Broken Politics'' quietly expands the concept of what a singer-songwriter album looks like in 2018.\"<ref name=\"Muse\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a positive review, stating \"Neneh Cherry has always bent styles to serve her own ends. She\u2019s still doing it on ''Broken Politics'', which folds a career\u2019s worth of musical obsessions into a single set. She\u2019s also speaking her mind, per usual, addressing our global shitshow not with histrionics, but with heartfelt, clear-eyed ruminations, sorrow, playfulness and resolve.\"<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Laura Snapes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented, \"Big issues litter ''Broken Politics''... In that beautifully snagged raw-silk voice, she sings about abortion, refugees, gun violence and the ease with which conspiracy calcifies into assumed fact these days. But it never feels heavy-handed.\"<ref name=\"Snapes\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| title1        = Fallen Leaves\n| writer1       = {{hlist|[[Neneh Cherry]]|[[Kieran Hebden]]|[[Cameron McVey]]|[[Paul Simm]]}}\n| length1       = 3:20\n| title2        = Kong\n| writer2       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey|[[Robert Del Naja]]|Euan Dickenson}}\n| length2       = 4:25\n| title3        = Poem Daddy\n| writer3       = [[The Last Poets|Suliaman El Hadi]]\n| length3       = 0:49\n| title4        = Synchronised Devotion\n| writer4       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey}}\n| length4       = 4:08\n| title5        = Deep Vein Thrombosis\n| writer5       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey|John Tonks}}\n| length5       = 4:32\n| title6        = Faster Than the Truth\n| writer6       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey|Benjamin Page}}\n| length6       = 3:47\n| title7        = Natural Skin Deep\n| writer7       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|Simm|McVey}}\n| length7       = 4:41\n| title8        = Shot Gun Shack\n| writer8       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey}}\n| length8       = 3:58\n| title9        = Black Monday\n| writer9       = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|Simm|McVey}}\n| length9       = 4:42\n| title10       = Cheap Breakfast Special\n| writer10      = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey}}\n| length10      = 1:09\n| title11       = Slow Release\n| writer11      = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey|[[Mattafix|Preetesh Hirji]]|Simm}}\n| length11      = 5:42\n| title12       = Soldier\n| writer12      = {{hlist|Cherry|Hebden|McVey|Simm}}\n| length12      = 4:55\n| total_length  = 46:01\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[Kieran Hebden]] \u2013 production, mixing\n*[[Robert \"3D\" Del Naja]] \u2013 production on \"Kong\"\n*[[Wolfgang Tillmans]] \u2013 photography, frontover artwork\n*Jacob Gr\u00f8nbech Jensen \u2013 design\n*[[Karl Berger|Professor Karl Berger]] \u2013 vibraphone on \"Synchronised Devotion\"\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br /> position\n|-\n{{album chart|Austria|46|artist=Neneh Cherry|album=Broken Politics|rowheader=true|accessdate=31 October 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Flanders|87|artist=Neneh Cherry|album=Broken Politics|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 October 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Wallonia|155|artist=Neneh Cherry|album=Broken Politics|rowheader=true|accessdate=3 November 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Germany4|55|id=370914|artist=Neneh Cherry|album=Broken Politics|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 October 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Scotland|36|date=20181026|rowheader=true|accessdate=27 October 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|Switzerland|52|artist=Neneh Cherry|album=Broken Politics|rowheader=true|accessdate=31 October 2018}}\n|-\n{{album chart|UK2|76|date=20181026|rowheader=true|accessdate=27 October 2018}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Neneh Cherry}}\n\n[[Category:2018 albums]]\n[[Category:Neneh Cherry albums]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: He\u2019s \u2192 He's, It\u2019s \u2192 It's (3), \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Politics"}
