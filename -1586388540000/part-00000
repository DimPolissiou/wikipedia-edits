His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999).

Despite recurring impatience with his stupidity, his fellow JSAers genuinely valued Johnny's good-heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend.

He returns home after the country elects its first [[President (government title)|President]]. Johnny joins the Justice Society on various adventures.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and Ragnar\u00f6k===\nFollowing the maxiseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was the one-shot ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America]] Special'' (1986). This book depicted the sacrifice of Johnny and his JSA teammates as they left the 'new' Post-''Crisis'' world and entered into a Limbo dimension. Caused by the actions of [[Adolf Hitler]] in April 1945, a wave of destruction appears over Earth even as it is settling down from the Crisis. In order to stop a literal [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], the heroes enter into an eternal battle and so leave the world.\n\n===Earth-One version===\nPrior to the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' retcon, an alternate version of Johnny Thunder existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]]. This version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. Upon meeting the Earth-Two Thunder (who had traveled to Earth-One out of curiosity), the criminal Johnny Thunder knocked his counterpart out and seized control of the Thunderbolt. He uses it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]], retroactively cease to exist. The criminal exploits the fact that the Thunderbolt is 'keyed' to simply obey Johnny Thunder, without any distinction made between alternate versions, leaving the Thunderbolt obligated to obey whichever Johnny is conscious despite his own morality; however, the Thunderbolt often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage, such as informing the criminal that the Justice Society\u2014who had come to Earth-1 to find out what had happened to their friends in the Justice League\u2014\u2014had disappeared, when they had, in fact, disguised themselves as the Justice League to provoke Johnny into revealing what had happened to their version, or making a barrier which keeps out cops, but not superheroes. The Earth-2 Johnny is apparently placed in a coma by the Thunderbolt's magic, though this is not actually shown.\n\nThe alternate version of Earth-One that Johnny creates is sometimes referred to as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-A|Earth-A]] (Earth Alternate), which Johnny thinks up himself. Thunder's 'Lawless League' of evil people with powers like the Justice League heroes, which are made up of Johnny's fellow criminals who were given the powers of the Justice League members, are defeated by the visiting [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] of Earth-Two, who had originally disguised themselves as the JLA, after learning of Johnny's disappearance, the Society's greater experience allowing them to easily defeat their criminal counterparts. They subsequently face off against Johnny Thunder on the Moon, and the three creatures that the Thunderbolt creates, Medusa-Man (who turns people into wood), Absorbo-Man (who can absorb the powers of others), and Repello-Man (who throws attacks back at their origins). All of the members are defeated, except for Doctor Fate. He creates a golden mask over Medusa-Man's face, and sends the wooden Mr. Terrific and Atom at Absorbo-Man, who had absorbed Green Lantern's power, meaning he is vulnerable to wood and is destroyed. He uses repello-magic on Repello-Man, which is repelled and destroys him. When the fight comes down to a struggle between [[Doctor Fate]] and the Thunderbolt, Johnny Thunder is so battered about by the combatting magic wielders - whose powers fail to do any actual damage to each other - that he finally gives up his attempts to use the Thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #37 (August 1965)</ref> The two Earths and their respective heroes are restored, with the Justice League mentioning their world's Johnny Thunder as a small-time criminal at their meeting. The Johnny Thunder of Earth-One would return as a threat in ''Justice League of America'' #219-220.\n\n===Johnny's return===\nThe absence of the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long. In 1992 DC published ''Armageddon: Inferno'', the miniseries which brought the JSA out of Limbo and into the Post-''Crisis'' world. This was followed by ''Justice Society of America'' (1992\u20131993). This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a 'normal' life. Johnny is depicted as an overweight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past. It is explained that before he had entered into Limbo, he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created ''Peachy's Frozen Yogurt'', a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner and now very wealthy. Of greater import to Johnny is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared. A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownership of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7, Johnny states: \"There were never very many of them...and the island magic had worn out. T-Bolt was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo. They had to leave or starve to death.\" This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunderbolt, the last remaining Bahdnesian.\n\nAfter this, Johnny is depicted as suffering from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. At one point, he loses track of a pen in which the Thunderbolt is being stored. The pen eventually ends up in the ownership of a young [[African American]] boy named Jakeem Williams, who takes up the name Johnny Jakeem Thunder or [[Jakeem Thunder]].<ref>''JLA'' #26. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Johnny Thunderbolt===\nIn a later battle with [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], Jakeem unwittingly cures Johnny Thunder of his Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, Johnny immediately falls prey to the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who takes over Johnny's body in order to command the Thunderbolt's powers. In the \"Stealing Thunder\" storyline, Jakeem is one of several heroes left free from the Ultra-Humanite's control. Eventually, Jakeem wrests control of the Thunderbolt back from the Ultra-Humanite, but Johnny Thunder loses his life. Jakeem then wishes that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow, so the genie chooses to merge with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both. He later assumes the name Johnny Thunderbolt.<ref>''JSA'' #46. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nJohnny Thunderbolt bears Johnny's likeness, though it is not clear how the personalities of Johnny and the two genies interact, and whether any one personality is dominant. Johnny's family is informed of his death and a funeral is held at Valhalla, a cemetery for superheroes. The family does not know that he lives on as the Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt eventually stops displaying Johnny's likeness while still speaking as him.\n\nDuring the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Johnny Thunder's body is reanimated as part of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nWhen [[Wally West]] was looking for someone to tether him to the universe again as seen in the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' reboot, he comes to a retirement home called the Good Life Rest Home where a now-elderly Johnny Thunder tries to reconnect to the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]], who have been lost since [[Joseph McCarthy]] had him reveal his secret and he had lost the Thunderbolt in the periods since. He tried to tell others who he was, but many think that he is crazy. When Wally comes to him to find the Justice Society, he disappears asking him to find the Justice Society. Believing that he was his old ally, Johnny tearfully calls out to him, apologizing for \"throwing (him) away\" in the past.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Johnny Thunder is seen climbing on a rooftop of a home for the elderly shouting \"Where are you Thunderbolt?\" and calls him (the Thunderbolt) to come back to him. He is later found by two men: presumably workers at the house. They ask him how did he get there and forcefully pull him from the edge of the roof, saving him from lightning that struck the place that he stood on. He shouts at them that they \"can't keep me locked up\" and struggles to get free of them. they say he \"has got a lot of a fight for a ninety-year-old\" and drag him into the building. On the way into the building, he says that \"The lightning says we need to find my friends\" and \"We lost the Justice Society\" and \"It's all my fault\", to which they reply with disbelief, saying \"Sure it did\" and \"Tell the nurse to up his meds.\"<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #21 (April 2017).

She was an rebooted variant of Johnny Thunder and is commonly assisted by a new [[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]]. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Catto |first1=Ed |title=Jonni Thunder a.k.a. Thunderbolt |journal=Back Issue |date=August 2018 |issue=106 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n====Publication history====\nJonni Thunder first appeared in a four-issue miniseries from 1985 named ''Jonni Thunder aka Thunderbolt'', written by [[Roy Thomas]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=309}}</ref>  In the first few issues, the title of the feature was ''Johnny Thunderbolt''. Since she was created by [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] expert [[Roy Thomas]] and appeared with the descendants of the original JSA in ''Infinity Inc.'', a potential connection to Johnny Thunder seemed likely, but was never expounded upon. Jonni existed on Earth-Two before ''Crisis'' and is briefly seen on the merged Earth resulting from the Crisis, attending a detectives' convention.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #11. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n====Fictional character biography====\nJohnni Thunder is a female private detective. A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind. First described as \"a stone once struck by the hand of [[Apu Illapu]], the [[Inca]] lightning god,\"<ref>''Jonni Thunder AKA Thunderbolt'' #3</ref> the thunderbolt is revealed in later issues of ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' to be a hostile alien energy-being, who is defeated by being re-imprisoned in the statue, leaving Jonni without powers.<ref>''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' #41</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'', a 2011 reboot of the [[DC Universe]], the history of characters related to the Golden Age of Comics has been drastically altered. A new version of Jonni Thunder is introduced on the parallel world of [[Earth Two|Earth 2]], appearing in the miniseries ''Earth 2: Worlds End''. This Jonni is seemingly possessed by the Thunderbolt, which grants her electrical abilities and a multi-armed appearance similar to a [[Hindu]] goddess. She is part of a team of heroes recruited by the mage [[John Constantine]] in his attempt to return to his own world.\n\n====Other versions====\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' continuity, she and [[Black Lightning]] have a child who becomes the [[anti-hero]] known as \"Lightning\", possessing the electricity-based powers of both of her parents. However, in the contemporary DC Universe, Black Lightning's daughter [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Lightning]], who recently joined the JSA, is identified as the daughter of Black Lightning and his ex-wife Lynn Stewart.\n\n====Reception====\nBrian Cronin of [[Comic Book Resources]] placed her series as part of failed reboots that are way better than the original explaining that \"Thomas and Giordano managed to do a well-done comic detective series, which is no small feat.\" .<ref>{{cite web |title=15 Failed Superhero Reboots (WAY Better Than The Original) |url=https://www.cbr.com/failed-comic-book-reboots/ |website=CBR |accessdate=2 April 2020 |date=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Son of Johnny Thunder (Will Power of ''Primal Force'')===\nWilliam Twotrees is the illegitimate son of 1940s hero Johnny Thunder and a [[Jicarilla Apache]] woman. Afraid of prejudices against mixed marriages, Johnny abandoned his son, something he later regretted deeply. However, it seems as if Johnny's partner, the magic Thunderbolt named Yz, left his mark on young William, who developed astonishing Thunderbolt powers later in his life. As Will Power, William joined the supernatural/metahuman team of heroes called the Leymen (a.k.a. [[Primal Force]]) until it was disbanded. He was last seen searching for his father, touring with a rock band as a \"human light show\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=willpower |title=The Unofficial Will Power Biography |publisher=Dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\nTwotrees has neither reappeared since the cancellation of the ''Primal Force'' series nor been referenced in any way in the later [[Justice Society of America]] titles.\n\n==In other media==\nJohnny Thunder and the Thunderbolt appear in three non-speaking roles in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Johnny himself only appears in the first episode, \"Initiation.\" The Thunderbolt goes on to appear in two more episodes by himself. The Thunderbolt appears in \"Initiation\", \"The Greatest Story Never Told\", and the series finale \"Destroyer.\" In \"Initiation\", he is seen with Johnny during [[Superman]]'s speech. In \"The Greatest Story Never Told\", he is seen helping the Justice League in the battle against [[Mordru]] without Johnny. In the series finale \"Destroyer\", he is seen at the end as the League walks down the stairs, also without Johnny. It is possible that this incarnation is Johnny Thunderbolt.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jakeem Thunder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/6ZygguQ36?url=http://toonopedia.com/jthundr1.htm Johnny Thunder (1939)] and [https://www.webcitation.org/6ZygmNKT8?url=http://toonopedia.com/jthundr2.htm Johnny Thunder (1948)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Unfortunately, Johnny immediately falls prey to the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who takes over Johnny's body in order to command the Thunderbolt's powers. In the \"Stealing Thunder\" storyline, Jakeem is one of several heroes left free from the Ultra-Humanite's control. Eventually, Jakeem wrests control of the Thunderbolt back from the Ultra-Humanite, but Johnny Thunder loses his life. Jakeem then wishes that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow, so the genie chooses to merge with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both. He later assumes the name Johnny Thunderbolt.<ref>''JSA'' #46. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nJohnny Thunderbolt bears Johnny's likeness, though it is not clear how the personalities of Johnny and the two genies interact, and whether any one personality is dominant. Johnny's family is informed of his death and a funeral is held at Valhalla, a cemetery for superheroes. The family does not know that he lives on as the Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt eventually stops displaying Johnny's likeness while still speaking as him.\n\nDuring the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Johnny Thunder's body is reanimated as part of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nWhen [[Wally West]] was looking for someone to tether him to the universe again as seen in the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' reboot, he comes to a retirement home called the Good Life Rest Home where a now-elderly Johnny Thunder tries to reconnect to the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]], who have been lost since [[Joseph McCarthy]] had him reveal his secret and he had lost the Thunderbolt in the periods since. He tried to tell others who he was, but many think that he is crazy. When Wally comes to him to find the Justice Society, he disappears asking him to find the Justice Society. Believing that he was his old ally, Johnny tearfully calls out to him, apologizing for \"throwing (him) away\" in the past.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Johnny Thunder is seen climbing on a rooftop of a home for the elderly shouting \"Where are you Thunderbolt?\" and calls him (the Thunderbolt) to come back to him. He is later found by two men: presumably workers at the house. They ask him how did he get there and forcefully pull him from the edge of the roof, saving him from lightning that struck the place that he stood on. He shouts at them that they \"can't keep me locked up\" and struggles to get free of them. they say he \"has got a lot of a fight for a ninety-year-old\" and drag him into the building. On the way into the building, he says that \"The lightning says we need to find my friends\" and \"We lost the Justice Society\" and \"It's all my fault\", to which they reply with disbelief, saying \"Sure it did\" and \"Tell the nurse to up his meds.\"<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #21 (April 2017).

He heads to an old steel mill, where he is assaulted by a group of thieving junkies. However, he is saved by [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Rorschach (Reggie Long)]]. Johnny Thunder finds Alan Scott's Green Lantern power battery. Rorschach asks Johnny Thunder what that Lantern is.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Rorschach, Saturn Girl and Johnny Thunder meet up with Ozymandias at the Owlship. Using Ozymandias' pet [[lynx]] Bubastis (revealed to have been cloned from the original Bubastis that Doctor Manhattan disintegrated and containing a sliver of his power) and the Lantern Battery, Ozymandias transports everyone to Doctor Manhattan's location at the Joker's \u201cfun house\u201d where Comedian is. After the confrontation with Doctor Manhattan, the injured Ozymandias makes it back to the Owlship, attacking Johnny and Saturn Girl, declaring that he can save everything and everyone.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018).

DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n===Jonni Thunder===\n'''Johnni Thunder''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] and superhero appearing in comics published by [[DC Comics]]. She was an rebooted variant of Johnny Thunder and is commonly assisted by a new [[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]]. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Catto |first1=Ed |title=Jonni Thunder a.k.a. Thunderbolt |journal=Back Issue |date=August 2018 |issue=106 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n====Publication history====\nJonni Thunder first appeared in a four-issue miniseries from 1985 named ''Jonni Thunder aka Thunderbolt'', written by [[Roy Thomas]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=309}}</ref>  In the first few issues, the title of the feature was ''Johnny Thunderbolt''. Since she was created by [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] expert [[Roy Thomas]] and appeared with the descendants of the original JSA in ''Infinity Inc.'', a potential connection to Johnny Thunder seemed likely, but was never expounded upon. Jonni existed on Earth-Two before ''Crisis'' and is briefly seen on the merged Earth resulting from the Crisis, attending a detectives' convention.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #11. DC Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n====Fictional character biography====\nJohnni Thunder is a female private detective. A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind. First described as \"a stone once struck by the hand of [[Apu Illapu]], the [[Inca]] lightning god,\"<ref>''Jonni Thunder AKA Thunderbolt'' #3</ref> the thunderbolt is revealed in later issues of ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' to be a hostile alien energy-being, who is defeated by being re-imprisoned in the statue, leaving Jonni without powers.<ref>''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' #41</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'', a 2011 reboot of the [[DC Universe]], the history of characters related to the Golden Age of Comics has been drastically altered. A new version of Jonni Thunder is introduced on the parallel world of [[Earth Two|Earth 2]], appearing in the miniseries ''Earth 2: Worlds End''. This Jonni is seemingly possessed by the Thunderbolt, which grants her electrical abilities and a multi-armed appearance similar to a [[Hindu]] goddess. She is part of a team of heroes recruited by the mage [[John Constantine]] in his attempt to return to his own world.\n\n====Other versions====\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' continuity, she and [[Black Lightning]] have a child who becomes the [[anti-hero]] known as \"Lightning\", possessing the electricity-based powers of both of her parents. However, in the contemporary DC Universe, Black Lightning's daughter [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Lightning]], who recently joined the JSA, is identified as the daughter of Black Lightning and his ex-wife Lynn Stewart.\n\n====Reception====\nBrian Cronin of [[Comic Book Resources]] placed her series as part of failed reboots that are way better than the original explaining that \"Thomas and Giordano managed to do a well-done comic detective series, which is no small feat.\" .<ref>{{cite web |title=15 Failed Superhero Reboots (WAY Better Than The Original) |url=https://www.cbr.com/failed-comic-book-reboots/ |website=CBR |accessdate=2 April 2020 |date=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Son of Johnny Thunder (Will Power of ''Primal Force'')===\nWilliam Twotrees is the illegitimate son of 1940s hero Johnny Thunder and a [[Jicarilla Apache]] woman. Afraid of prejudices against mixed marriages, Johnny abandoned his son, something he later regretted deeply. However, it seems as if Johnny's partner, the magic Thunderbolt named Yz, left his mark on young William, who developed astonishing Thunderbolt powers later in his life. As Will Power, William joined the supernatural/metahuman team of heroes called the Leymen (a.k.a. [[Primal Force]]) until it was disbanded. He was last seen searching for his father, touring with a rock band as a \"human light show\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=willpower |title=The Unofficial Will Power Biography |publisher=Dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\nTwotrees has neither reappeared since the cancellation of the ''Primal Force'' series nor been referenced in any way in the later [[Justice Society of America]] titles.\n\n==In other media==\nJohnny Thunder and the Thunderbolt appear in three non-speaking roles in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Johnny himself only appears in the first episode, \"Initiation.\" The Thunderbolt goes on to appear in two more episodes by himself. The Thunderbolt appears in \"Initiation\", \"The Greatest Story Never Told\", and the series finale \"Destroyer.\" In \"Initiation\", he is seen with Johnny during [[Superman]]'s speech. In \"The Greatest Story Never Told\", he is seen helping the Justice League in the battle against [[Mordru]] without Johnny. In the series finale \"Destroyer\", he is seen at the end as the League walks down the stairs, also without Johnny. It is possible that this incarnation is Johnny Thunderbolt.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jakeem Thunder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/6ZygguQ36?url=http://toonopedia.com/jthundr1.htm Johnny Thunder (1939)] and [https://www.webcitation.org/6ZygmNKT8?url=http://toonopedia.com/jthundr2.htm Johnny Thunder (1948)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Its territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s.\n\nPortugal is the oldest [[nation state]] on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in [[Europe]], its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974), ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]].

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, however, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic.\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portug\u00e1lia'' \u2013 the [[County of Portugal]].<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nLater the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal.

He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes.

As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial.

When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

[[Protected areas of Portugal]] include one national park, 12 natural parks, nine natural reserves, five natural monuments, and seven protected landscapes, which include the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-Ger\u00eas]], the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] and the [[Paul de Arzila|Paul d'Arzila]].\n\nThese natural environments are shaped by diverse flora, and include widespread species of pine (especially the ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' and ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' species), the English oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), the Pyrenean oak (''[[Quercus pyrenaica]]'') the chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), the cork-oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') or the Portuguese oak (''[[Quercus faginea]]''). Due to their economic value, some species of the genus ''Eucalyptus'' were introduced and are now common, despite their environmental impact.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300|align=left\n| image1 = Estrela Mountain Dog 6 month old male.jpg  |width1 = 736 |height1 = 541\n| image4 = Estrela Mar\u00e7o 2010-40.jpg |width4 = 3872 |height4 = 2700\n| image3 = Abejaruco.jpg  |width3 = 1600 |height3 = 1200\n| image2 = Loutre des pyrenees baronnies 2004.jpg |width2 = 594  |height2 = 394\n| footer = Left-to-right: an [[Estrela Mountain Dog]], a [[Eurasian otter]], a [[European bee-eater]], and a [[Lusitano]] horse\n}}\n[[Laurisilva]] is a unique type of subtropical rainforest, which nowadays, in Europe, is only restricted to the Iberian Peninsula: in the Azores, and in particular on the island of Madeira, there are large forests of endemic ''Laurisilva'' (the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve).\nThere are several species of diverse [[mammal]]ian fauna, including the [[fox]], [[badger]], [[iberian lynx]], [[iberian wolf]], [[wild goat]] (''[[Capra pyrenaica]]''), wild cat (''[[Felis silvestris]]''), [[hare]], [[weasel]], [[European polecat|polecat]], [[chameleon]], [[mongoose]], [[civet]], the occasional [[brown bear]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190509-first-brown-bear-sighting-portugal-over-century|title=First brown bear sighting in Portugal in over a century|date=9 May 2019|website=France 24}}</ref> and many others. Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds, in places such as [[Cape St. Vincent]] or the [[Serra de Monchique|Monchique]] mountains, where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring (return migration).\n\nMost of the avian species congregate along the [[Iberian Peninsula]] since it is the closest stopover between Northern Europe and Africa. Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal (either for nesting or during the course of migration), and annually there are new registries of nesting species. The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American, European, and African birds, while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species.\n\nThere are more than 100 freshwater fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western portion of country, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe on some beaches.\n\nThere are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macaronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal. In Madeira, for example, it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land [[gastropods]].\n\n== Government and administration ==\n{{Main|Government of Portugal|Politics of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 220\n\n | image1 = Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa em fevereiro de 2018.jpg\n | width1 = 514 | height1 = 728\n | caption1 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], [[List of Presidents of Portugal|20th]] [[President of Portugal]]</div>\n\n | image2 = Ant\u00f3nio Costa em 2017.jpg\n | width2 = 824 | height2 = 1152\n | caption2 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|119th]] [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]</div>\n\n }}\nPortugal has been a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] since the ratification of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Constitution of 1976]], with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.

The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\n\nPortugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&nbsp;\u2013 People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.\n\n=== Presidency of the Republic ===\n{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}\n[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Bel\u00e9m Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]\n\nThe Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]].

Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.\n\n=== Government ===\n\n{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}\n\n[[File:Lisboa April 2014-15a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]\n\nThe Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.\n\nIt has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative powers.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain share the world's oldest active military accord through their [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] ([[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]), which was signed in 1373.\n\nThere are two international territorial disputes, both with Spain:\n* [[Olivenza]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]].

The Navy (10,700 personnel, of which 1,580 are [[Portuguese Marines|marines]]), the world's oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines, and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the [[Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet]] as the main combat aircraft.\n\nIn addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]], a security force subject to military law and organization ([[gendarmerie]]) comprising 25,000 personnel.

The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures.

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male).

Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]].

All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic.

Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[Reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     =\n | image1    = Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg\n | image2    = Santu\u00e1rio de F\u00e1tima (3) - Jul 2008.jpg\n | footer    = The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King Sanctuary]] and the [[Sanctuary of F\u00e1tima|Shrine of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] in Portugal are two of the world's most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites.\n }}\n\nThe growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910\u201326) changed the role and importance of organized religion.\n\nPortugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]] and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Portugal|Portuguese language}}\n\n[[File:Gen\u00edsio04.jpg|thumb|left|A sign in [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] in [[Miranda do Douro]], [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]]]]\n\n[[File:Map_of_the_portuguese_language_in_the_world.png|thumb|left|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the world's 6th most spoken language, with approx. 260 million speakers.]]\n\nPortuguese is the official language of Portugal.

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS.\nFive regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

It is the westernmost [[sovereign state]] of [[mainland Europe]], being bordered to the west and south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the north and east by [[Spain]]. Its territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s.\n\nPortugal is the oldest [[nation state]] on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in [[Europe]], its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

During this time Portugal monopolized the [[spice trade]], [[Treaty of Tordesillas|divided the world into hemispheres of dominion with Castille]], and the empire expanded with military campaigns in [[Portuguese presence in Asia|Asia]]. However, events such as the [[Lisbon Earthquake|1755 Lisbon earthquake]], the country's occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the independence of Brazil (1822) erased to a great extent [[Economic history of Portugal|Portugal's prior opulence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese First Republic]] was established, later being superseded by the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974), ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]]. The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|handover of Macau to China]] (1999) marked the end of what can be considered the [[Portuguese Empire|longest-lived colonial empire]].\n\nPortugal has left a profound cultural, architectural and linguistic influence [[Evolution of the Portuguese Empire|across the globe]], with a legacy of around 250 million [[Lusophone|Portuguese speakers]], and many [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese-based creoles]].

A member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], Portugal was also one of the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[eurozone]], the [[OECD]], and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]''''';<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/portugal|title=Portugal \u2013 Origin and meaning of the name Portugal by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com}}</ref> a city where present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]] now stands, at the mouth of the [[River Douro]] in the north of what is now Portugal. The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.

[[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths. Under the [[Visigoths]], Gallaecia was a well-defined space governed by a doge of its own. Doges at this time were related to the monarchy acted as princes in all matters. Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond.

Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe on some beaches.\n\nThere are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macaronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal. In Madeira, for example, it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land [[gastropods]].\n\n== Government and administration ==\n{{Main|Government of Portugal|Politics of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 220\n\n | image1 = Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa em fevereiro de 2018.jpg\n | width1 = 514 | height1 = 728\n | caption1 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], [[List of Presidents of Portugal|20th]] [[President of Portugal]]</div>\n\n | image2 = Ant\u00f3nio Costa em 2017.jpg\n | width2 = 824 | height2 = 1152\n | caption2 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|119th]] [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]</div>\n\n }}\nPortugal has been a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] since the ratification of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Constitution of 1976]], with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.

The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\n\nPortugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&nbsp;\u2013 People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.\n\n=== Presidency of the Republic ===\n{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}\n[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Bel\u00e9m Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]\n\nThe Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]]. He or she has also supervision and [[reserve power]]s. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.\n\n=== Government ===\n\n{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}\n\n[[File:Lisboa April 2014-15a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]\n\nThe Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.\n\nIt has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization, about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly.\n\nThe [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] \u2013 under the presidency of the Prime Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers) \u2013 acts as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Parliament ===\n[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (Sharon Hahn Darlin) S\u00e3o Bento.jpg|thumb|right|[[S\u00e3o Bento Palace]] is the seat of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Legislature]].]]\n{{main|Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|List of political parties in Portugal}}\n\nThe [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], in Lisbon, is the national [[parliament]] of Portugal. It is the main legislative body, although the Government also has limited legislative powers.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats. The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|CDS-PP]] parties form the opposition to the government alongside [[People\u2013Animals\u2013Nature|PAN]], Chega, Iniciativa Liberal and Partido Livre.\n\n=== Law and drug policy ===\n[[File:Campus Justi\u00e7a (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Lisbon's Campus of Justice]]\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: \"Law of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{main|Judiciary of Portugal|Law of Portugal|Drug policy of Portugal|LGBT rights in Portugal}}\nThe Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures.

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male).

Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]].

All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic.

Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[Reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     =\n | image1    = Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg\n | image2    = Santu\u00e1rio de F\u00e1tima (3) - Jul 2008.jpg\n | footer    = The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King Sanctuary]] and the [[Sanctuary of F\u00e1tima|Shrine of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] in Portugal are two of the world's most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites.\n }}\n\nThe growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910\u201326) changed the role and importance of organized religion.\n\nPortugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]] and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Portugal|Portuguese language}}\n\n[[File:Gen\u00edsio04.jpg|thumb|left|A sign in [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] in [[Miranda do Douro]], [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]]]]\n\n[[File:Map_of_the_portuguese_language_in_the_world.png|thumb|left|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the world's 6th most spoken language, with approx. 260 million speakers.]]\n\nPortuguese is the official language of Portugal.

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS.\nFive regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].
