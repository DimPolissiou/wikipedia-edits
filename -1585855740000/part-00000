Since 1996, the nominees have been announced in February, and the winners announced at a gala banquet held in May, usually during the [[BookExpo America]] fair.

Various [[hot spring]]s were used during wintertime. The Cahuilla hunted rabbit, mountain goat and quail, while also trapping fish in nearby lakes and rivers.

The alternating non-reservation sections were granted to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] as an incentive to bring rail lines through the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\nA number of streets and areas in Palm Springs are named for Native-American notables, including Andreas, Arenas, Amado, Belardo, Lugu, Patencio, Saturnino and Chino.

In the meantime he studied to be an opera singer, a [[bass (voice)|bass]].

His movie career began in the late 1930s with bit parts and secondary characters in wartime movies. After the war he began working as a dubber for the Italian versions of [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts, voicing [[Oliver Hardy]]. Early roles included Fellini's'' [[The White Sheik]] ''in 1952, Fellini's ''[[I vitelloni]] ''(1953), a movie about young slackers, in which he plays a weak, effeminate immature loafer and a starring role in ''[[The Bachelor (1955 film)|The Bachelor]]'' playing a single man trying to find love. In 1959 he appeared in Monicelli's ''[[The Great War (1959 film)|Great War]]'', considered by many critics and film historians to be one of the best Italian comedies. The Hollywood Foreign Press recognized his abilities when he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor in a Musical or Comedy for ''[[To bed or not to bed]]'' (1963). Sordi acted alongside Britain's [[David Niven]] in the [[World War II]] comedy ''[[The Best of Enemies (1961 film)|The Best of Enemies]]'' and in 1965 he was in another highly regarded comedy, ''[[I complessi]]'' (''Complexes'').\n\nIn 1969 he was a member of the jury at the [[6th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |title=6th Moscow International Film Festival (1969) |accessdate=17 December 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194825/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |archivedate=January 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSordi also succeeded in dramatic roles, most notably in 1977's ''[[Un borghese piccolo piccolo]]'' (''An Average Little Man'') in which he portrays an elderly civil servant whose son is killed in an armed robbery, and sets out to exact revenge.\n\nIn 1984, he directed and co-scripted ''Tutti dentro'' (''Off to jail, everybody''), in which he played a judge who has warrants for corruption served on ministers and businessmen.\nAlberto Sordi<ref>{{cite web |url =https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Sordi|title =\nItalian actor Alberto Sordi|accessdate = 3 April 2018 }}</ref> was really masterful in two broad roles: one being the one of the underdog, militating against injustices and prevarications, the other that of the prevaricator himself.\nOne has only to watch his performances as the returning emigrant unjustly convicted in ''[[Detenuto in attesa di giudizio]]'' or the miserly sub-proletarian of ''[[Lo scopone scientifico]]'' teased by the old millionaire [[Bette Davis]] into endless card games where he hopes to find release from his poverty to appreciate his skills in the first role, while the rampant, unscrupulous doctor he plays in ''[[Il medico della mutua]] ''is the perfect example of his aptness at rendering characters who were both truly despicable and completely believable. In 1985, he was a member of the jury at the [[35th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1985\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1985/04_jury_1985/04_Jury_1985.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |accessdate=8 January 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nSordi died shortly before his eighty-third birthday following a heart attack. A crowd in excess of a million gathered to pay their last respects at his funeral by the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the largest of such event ever attended in Rome, second only to that of [[Pope John Paul II]] who died two years later.\nSordi was also a big supporter of [[AS Roma]] football team.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Actor===\n{{div

His movie career began in the late 1930s with bit parts and secondary characters in wartime movies. After the war he began working as a dubber for the Italian versions of [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts, voicing [[Oliver Hardy]]. Early roles included Fellini's'' [[The White Sheik]] ''in 1952, Fellini's ''[[I vitelloni]] ''(1953), a movie about young slackers, in which he plays a weak, effeminate immature loafer and a starring role in ''[[The Bachelor (1955 film)|The Bachelor]]'' playing a single man trying to find love. In 1959 he appeared in Monicelli's ''[[The Great War (1959 film)|Great War]]'', considered by many critics and film historians to be one of the best Italian comedies. The Hollywood Foreign Press recognized his abilities when he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor in a Musical or Comedy for ''[[To bed or not to bed]]'' (1963). Sordi acted alongside Britain's [[David Niven]] in the [[World War II]] comedy ''[[The Best of Enemies (1961 film)|The Best of Enemies]]'' and in 1965 he was in another highly regarded comedy, ''[[I complessi]]'' (''Complexes'').\n\nIn 1969 he was a member of the jury at the [[6th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |title=6th Moscow International Film Festival (1969) |accessdate=17 December 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194825/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |archivedate=January 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSordi also succeeded in dramatic roles, most notably in 1977's ''[[Un borghese piccolo piccolo]]'' (''An Average Little Man'') in which he portrays an elderly civil servant whose son is killed in an armed robbery, and sets out to exact revenge.\n\nIn 1984, he directed and co-scripted ''Tutti dentro'' (''Off to jail, everybody''), in which he played a judge who has warrants for corruption served on ministers and businessmen.\nAlberto Sordi<ref>{{cite web |url =https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Sordi|title =\nItalian actor Alberto Sordi|accessdate = 3 April 2018 }}</ref> was really masterful in two broad roles: one being the one of the underdog, militating against injustices and prevarications, the other that of the prevaricator himself.\nOne has only to watch his performances as the returning emigrant unjustly convicted in ''[[Detenuto in attesa di giudizio]]'' or the miserly sub-proletarian of ''[[Lo scopone scientifico]]'' teased by the old millionaire [[Bette Davis]] into endless card games where he hopes to find release from his poverty to appreciate his skills in the first role, while the rampant, unscrupulous doctor he plays in ''[[Il medico della mutua]] ''is the perfect example of his aptness at rendering characters who were both truly despicable and completely believable. In 1985, he was a member of the jury at the [[35th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1985\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1985/04_jury_1985/04_Jury_1985.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |accessdate=8 January 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nSordi died shortly before his eighty-third birthday following a heart attack. A crowd in excess of a million gathered to pay their last respects at his funeral by the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the largest of such event ever attended in Rome, second only to that of
