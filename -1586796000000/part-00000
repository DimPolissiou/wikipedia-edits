In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Phytoplankton autotrophically produces biomass by converting [[inorganic compound]]s into [[organic compound|organic]] ones.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. [[Energy pyramid]]s, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included, since this is dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\"<ref name=\"Odum05\">{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.

Kirk (William Shatner) first appeared in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' serving aboard the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] as captain. Kirk leads his crew as they explore new worlds, new civilizations, and \"[[where no man has gone before|boldly go where no man has gone before]]\". Often, the characters of [[Spock]] and [[Leonard McCoy]] act as his logical and emotional sounding boards, respectively. Captain Kirk has been portrayed in numerous films, books, comics, webisodes, and video games. \n\nKirk, played by [[William Shatner]], first appears in ''Star Trek'''s first episode, \"[[The Man Trap]]\", broadcast on September 8, 1966. Shatner continued in the role for the show's three seasons, and later provided the voice of the animated version of Kirk in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973\u20131974). Shatner returned to the role for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and in six subsequent films. [[Chris Pine]] portrays an alternative young version of the character in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film. Pine reprised his role in ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and in ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016). Other actors have played the character in fan-created media, and the character has been the subject of multiple [[Parody|spoofs]] and satires.\n\n==Depiction==\nJames Tiberius Kirk was born in [[Riverside, Iowa]], on March 22, 2233,<ref name=\"Star Trek Chronology The History of the Future\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek Chronology The History of the Future|last=Okuda|first=Michael|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1993|location=1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY. 10011|pages=29, 184|authorlink=Michael Okuda}}</ref> where he was raised by his parents, George and Winona Kirk.<ref>{{cite book |title=Best Destiny |authorlink=Diane Carey |first=Diane |last=Carey |page=[https://archive.org/details/bestdestiny00care/page/38 38] |quote=George and Winona Kirk, and their boys, George Samuel, Junior, and James Tiberius |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-671-79588-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/bestdestiny00care/page/38 }}</ref> Although born on Earth, Kirk lived for a time on [[The Conscience of the King (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Tarsus IV]], where he was one of nine surviving witnesses to the massacre of 4,000 colonists by [[The Conscience of the King (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Kodos the Executioner]].

Picard convinces Kirk to return to Picard's present to help stop the villain Soran from destroying Veridian III's sun. Although Kirk initially refuses the offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him the one thing he has always sought: the ability to make a difference. The two leave the Nexus and stop Soran. However, Kirk is mortally wounded; as he dies, Picard assures him that he helped to \"make a difference\".

In order to obtain a fraudulent compensation of $4.6 million NT, he pretended to discipline his 15-year-old adopted son, slapping him so hard that the child fell and hit his head on the concrete wall. The child died as a result from the injury, with Chen claiming that it was an accident.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U3NT1sAlaM 2012.12.16  Court No. 52/ Six-man murder and insurance case]</ref>\n\nIn 1995, facing another financial crisis, Ruiqin targeted his own 15-year-old son. He took him to a heavy ornamental stone and hit the boy on the back of the head, cracking his skull.

Under the pretense of going on a trip, the two drove to [[Xingang, Chiayi|Xingang]]. Suddenly, Chen stopped the car, pulled out a wooden stick from under the driver's seat and beat his wife to death. After the murder, Ruiqin dumped her body on Shixian Road in [[Chiayi]], creating the illusion of a car accident. Since he had blood on his clothes, Ruiqin was reluctant about catching a taxi back home. In this case, not only did he obtain Wang's insurance claims of $11.37 million NT, but also continued to receive her pension.<ref>[https://news.tvbs.com.tw/other/412540 Chen Ruiqun frankly admits to killing his second wife during trial]</ref>\n\nChen's late wife often visited a clothing store owned by a woman named Yan Liqin, a widow with two children. After more than a month from his wife's death, Chen took the initiative to \"entangle\" himself around the clothing store. After strenuous pursuit, Liqin was moved, and they married in 1997. Ruiqin's vicious behavior was unchanged, however, as he tried to fraudulently clear his debts the following year. Yan's 16-year-old son was having a headache, so Ruiqin fed him sleeping pills, claiming that they were painkillers. While the son was sleeping, Ruiqin transported him to the stairs, where he dropped him on his head, creating the illusion of an accidental death. He applied for an insurance claim of $15.5 million NT, but the insurance company, which had noticed that multiple relatives had died of suspicious injuries relating to head trauma, paid only $250,000. Since Yan also believed that her son had been murdered, she continued to investigate for possible evidence to prove it. Perplexingly, Ruiqin tried to deceive his wife by putting on a condom on the boy's genitalia and explaining that he had died while having sex. Liqin remained with him for a while, but as they relationship worsened, she divorced him. During the divorce, she was intimidated by Chen to pay a $1.2 million NT \"breakup fee\", but was otherwise left unharmed.<ref name=\"\u6bd2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chen Ruiqin's ex-wife: He is horny and dangerous|url=https://tw.appledaily.com/headline/daily/20030526/64889/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ6pyUCNMNw 2012.12.16 Cour No. 52/ Chen Ruiqin murdered six relatives for fraud]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, many insurance companies discovered that the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Chen's relatives, especially his three sons, whom all received \"head injuries\" and died from [[cerebral edema]], were suspicious, as all of them had been insured for millions of NT. After holding discussions with representatives of various companies, they unanimously agreed to prevent Chen Ruiqin from insuring people and reported this to the police. The then-legislator, [[Chen Chao-jung (politician)|Chen Chao-jung]], was informed of this ordeal, and soon held a press conference expressing his doubts about the suspect. Chao-jung himself would later personally go and interrogate Ruiqin, who, out of fear, hid under the table and refused to come out. The next day, he angrily announced before the media that he would \"retain the right to pursue the lawsuit against the false accusations of legislators.\"<ref name=\"\u6bd2\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, Chen Ruiqin met Chen Yiling, a female insurance saleswoman, with whom he started a romantic relationship. He noticed that she had considerable savings, and asked his new girlfriend to borrow some money for his mortgage, to which she replied that she would consider it. Although the pair only knew each other for two days, Chen planned to kill her directly and then rob her. He invited Yiling by telephone to the Wu Xian Emperor's Temple on Xiangrong Street, in West Chiayi. From there, he took her to [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]] in his black jeep. While there, he opened a capsule of sleeping Baogan Pills, and put sleeping powder in it. When Yiling fell asleep, Ruiqin tied her hands with nylon rope. When she awoke, Chen told her that he wanted to play, and so he beat and eventually strangled his girlfriend into unconsciousness. When he saw the unconscious Yiling, he suddenly felt aroused and attempted to have sex with her, but because of his [[sexual dysfunction]], he instead sexually assaulted her. After he finished, Ruiqin contemplated throwing Yiling off a cliff, but unbearing of the thought of not stealing something, he robbed her of her gold [[Rolex]] watch, [[jadeite]] necklace, rings, $1 million NT in cash, credit and ATM cards, mobile phones and two blank checks. He then hit Yiling with a stone and beat her to death, throwing her body off the mountain cliff. After disposing of the corpse he went to Taipei with his other casial girlfriend, Xiao. On the way, he gave her the Rolex. He also held onto the deceased Chen's bank cards, but couldn't take the money because he didn't know the password. The attempted theft was detected by the authorities, and Ruiqin was arrested.<ref>[http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/3/7/18/n344561.htm The murderer Chen Ruiqin was asking to be executed]</ref>\n\nFollowing his arrest, Chen confessed to the police about killing his two wives and three sons, but claimed that he had nothing to do with the disappearances of his two female friends. After his death sentence was upheld, he retracted his confession and offered to help the police in locating the missing women, but his bluff was called out, as the investigators understood that he was just trying to weasel out of his execution.<ref name=\"\u4f0f\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chen Ruiqin layed down!

At a fifth trial the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court reduced to sentence to a 20-year-old fixed imprisonment term, because of his cooperation with punishment regulations and the application of commutation changes in law. He still remained with a death sentence for the murder of Chen Yiling, and the appeal for it was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]]. While on death row, he was detained at the Taichung Detention Center.<ref>[http://www.chinanews.com/news/2004/2004-12-21/26/519377.shtml Criminal given 5 death sentences and 1 life sentence for the murder of 5 relatives]\u3002</ref>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013, Chen Ruiqin appealed to the Taichung Branhc of the Taiwan High Court a total of eight times for a retrial, all of which were rejected. A protest was filed for the Supreme Court in 2011, but it was also dismissed.<ref>[http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/society/paper/672184 Chen Ruiqin criticized the government, calling it \"garbage\"]</ref>\n\nOn April 19, 2013, the Minister of Legal Affairs, [[Tseng Yung-fu]], signed an execution warrant for Chen Ruiqin.

Chen Ruiqin took a deep and hearty inhale, but as the drugs administered weren't enough to kill him, he was induced into a coma and subsequently shot in the head. He was 62 years old.<ref>[https://www.ettoday.net/news/20130420/195121.htm?t=%E6%AE%BA2%E5%A6%BB3%E5%AD%90%E8%A9%90%E4%BF%9D%E7%B5%82%E4%BC%8F%E6%B3%95%E3%80%80%E9%99%B3%E7%91%9E%E6%AC%BD%E9%81%BA%E9%AB%94%E7%84%A1%E4%BA%BA%E8%AA%8D%E9%A0%98 After killing 2 wives and 3 sons for scams, the body of Chen Ruiqin remains unclaimed]</ref>\n\nThe following day, since Ruiqin had murdered all his male heirs, nobody came to collect his corpse after the autopsy.<ref>[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20130420/34965535/%E6%AE%BA2%E5%A6%BB3%E5%AD%90%E9%99%B3%E7%91%9E%E6%AC%BD%E6%B2%92%E4%BA%BA%E6%94%B6%E5%B1%8D Chen Ruiqin killed 2 wives and 3 sons]</ref> Even if he had agreed to [[Organ donation|donate his organs]] before death, no hospital agreed to take them, and so, the Legal Department had no choice to discard it in a funeral home.

After the murder, Ruiqin dumped her body on Shixian Road in [[Chiayi]], creating the illusion of a car accident. Since he had blood on his clothes, Ruiqin was reluctant about catching a taxi back home.

After more than a month from his wife's death, Chen took the initiative to \"entangle\" himself around the clothing store. After strenuous pursuit, Liqin was moved, and they married in 1997. Ruiqin's vicious behavior was unchanged, however, as he tried to fraudulently clear his debts the following year. Yan's 16-year-old son was having a headache, so Ruiqin fed him sleeping pills, claiming that they were painkillers. While the son was sleeping, Ruiqin transported him to the stairs, where he dropped him on his head, creating the illusion of an accidental death. He applied for an insurance claim of $15.5 million NT, but the insurance company, which had noticed that multiple relatives had died of suspicious injuries relating to head trauma, paid only $250,000. Since Yan also believed that her son had been murdered, she continued to investigate for possible evidence to prove it. Perplexingly, Ruiqin tried to deceive his wife by putting on a condom on the boy's genitalia and explaining that he had died while having sex. Liqin remained with him for a while, but as they relationship worsened, she divorced him.

After holding discussions with representatives of various companies, they unanimously agreed to prevent Chen Ruiqin from insuring people and reported this to the police. The then-legislator, [[Chen Chao-jung (politician)|Chen Chao-jung]], was informed of this ordeal, and soon held a press conference expressing his doubts about the suspect. Chao-jung himself would later personally go and interrogate Ruiqin, who, out of fear, hid under the table and refused to come out. The next day, he angrily announced before the media that he would \"retain the right to pursue the lawsuit against the false accusations of legislators.\"<ref name=\"\u6bd2\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, Chen Ruiqin met Chen Yiling, a female insurance saleswoman, with whom he started a romantic relationship. He noticed that she had considerable savings, and asked his new girlfriend to borrow some money for his mortgage, to which she replied that she would consider it. Although the pair only knew each other for two days, Chen planned to kill her directly and then rob her. He invited Yiling by telephone to the Wu Xian Emperor's Temple on Xiangrong Street, in West Chiayi. From there, he took her to [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]] in his black jeep. While there, he opened a capsule of sleeping Baogan Pills, and put sleeping powder in it. When Yiling fell asleep, Ruiqin tied her hands with nylon rope. When she awoke, Chen told her that he wanted to play, and so he beat and eventually strangled his girlfriend into unconsciousness. When he saw the unconscious Yiling, he suddenly felt aroused and attempted to have sex with her, but because of his [[sexual dysfunction]], he instead sexually assaulted her. After he finished, Ruiqin contemplated throwing Yiling off a cliff, but unbearing of the thought of not stealing something, he robbed her of her gold [[Rolex]] watch, [[jadeite]] necklace, rings, $1 million NT in cash, credit and ATM cards, mobile phones and two blank checks. He then hit Yiling with a stone and beat her to death, throwing her body off the mountain cliff. After disposing of the corpse he went to Taipei with his other casial girlfriend, Xiao. On the way, he gave her the Rolex. He also held onto the deceased Chen's bank cards, but couldn't take the money because he didn't know the password.

Usually, this event occurs after a [[Demand shock|demand]] or [[supply shock]]. Common examples include price increases of basic necessities after  [[natural disasters]]. In precise, legal usage, it is the name of a crime that applies in some jurisdictions of the [[United States]] during civil emergencies. In less precise usage, it can refer either to prices obtained by practices inconsistent with a competitive [[free market]] or to [[windfall profits]]. Price gouging may be considered exploitative and unethical.\n\nThe term is similar to [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]] but can be distinguished by being short-term and localized and by being restricted to essentials such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and equipment needed to preserve life and property. In jurisdictions where there is no such crime, the term may still be used to pressure firms to refrain from such behavior. This sucks its not helpful.\n\nThe term is not in widespread use in [[Mainstream economics|mainstream economic theory]], but it is sometimes used to refer to practices of a [[coercive monopoly]] that raises prices above the [[market rate]] that would otherwise prevail in a [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/kudlow061400.asp |title=Lawrence Kudlow |website=Jewishworldreview.com |date=2000-06-14 |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> Alternatively, it may refer to suppliers' benefiting to excess from a short-term change in the [[demand curve]].\n\n==Laws against price gouging==\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, [[State law (United States)|state laws]] against price gouging have been held as [[constitutional]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://louisville.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2009/10/05/daily21.html|title=State\u2019s anti-price-gouging law upheld|date=October 6, 2009|work=Business First of Louisville|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref> at the state level as a valid exercise of the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] to preserve order during an emergency, and may be combined with anti-[[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] measures.\n\nAs of January 2019, 34 states have laws against price-gouging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html|title=Price Gouging Laws by State|work=consumer.findlaw.com|accessdate=2018-01-11}}</ref> Price-gouging is often defined in terms of the three criteria listed below:<ref name=\"zwolinski3\">{{cite journal|author=M.

The economists opposing the proposal argued that such legislation would lead to a misallocation of resources and lead to lower supply and greater scarcity of the resources, or argued that the proposal in question was vague.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/price-gouging|title=Price gouging|last=|first=|date=|website=www.igmchicago.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>\n\nEconomists [[Thomas Sowell]] and [[Walter E. Williams]], among others, argue against laws that interfere with large or exorbitant price changes. According to this view, high prices can be viewed as information for use in determining the best allocation of scarce resources for which there are multiple uses. Many libertarian economists{{who|date=January 2020}} oppose price gouging legislation and argue that it prevents goods from going to individuals who value them the most and not just to those with the greatest wealth. For example, after a storm has felled numerous trees in a locality, advocates of this theory claim that a rise in the price of chain saws will discourage their purchase by people with only a minor need for them, making them more available for those with the strongest need, rather than the most wealth. With price gouging laws in place, producers are only able to charge a price set by law, and therefore have little additional incentive to increase supply to adversely impacted areas. If producers are able to make extra profit, these theorists argue, then they will increase the supply. It is claimed that these laws lead to [[aftermarket (merchandise)|after-market]] operations as consumers with the lowest [[opportunity costs]] buy up desired resources and attempt to resell them to public at higher prices.\n\nCritics claim that laws against price-gouging could discourage businesses from proactively preparing for a disaster. One example given in support of this view is that a business could install an expensive [[emergency power system]] for [[power outage]]s. However, if it is prohibited from large price increases, the costs cannot be recovered during the relatively short amount of time when there is no power. As a result, a business that proactively prepared could not compete with others that did not. (This is generally unnecessary for similar businesses in close proximity to one another.) According to this theory, the end result would be needless shortages and more hardship for the public, or under extreme circumstances, it could be deadly. To correct the situation, those opposed to price gouging laws argue that if not abolished entirely, laws would have to be amended to allow the [[amortization]] of equipment that is useful ''only'' during a disaster. Unlike amortizing for tax purposes, this would account for how equipment is sporadically paid off internally with the extra [[revenue]].\n\nIn support of the argument against price-gouging legislation, some assert that a similar situation applies to those who are outside of the disaster zone and willing to go there to sell what is desperately needed. If they are unable to recover their travel costs and be compensated for the inconvenience of staying in an inhospitable disaster zone, only the [[Altruism|altruistic]] few would bother to do so. Since most anti-price gouging laws are based on the pre-disaster selling price, a person who buys needed supplies at the retail level in an unaffected area will more easily run afoul of the law than a large wholesaler would. They assert that it would be the \"little guy\" who could lose more on a percentage basis, in addition to the possibility of hefty fines, rather than \"big business.\"\n\nOpponents of anti-price gouging laws also claim that in terms of [[fair value]], such laws could also require producers to sell goods below their [[market-clearing price]]: the market clearing price is the amount at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded. According to this theory, if goods are priced above their market-clearing price then there will be a surplus of goods, and the converse leads to a shortage of goods. Thus, advocates of this theory claim that consumers would be unable to buy the necessary goods which they desire in a time of need.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[neoclassical economics]], anti-price gouging laws prevent [[allocative efficiency]]. Allocative efficiency refers to when prices function properly, markets tend to allocate resources to their most valued uses. In turn those who value the good the most (and not just the wealthiest) will be willing to pay a higher price than those who do not value the good as much.<ref name=\"zwolinski3\"/> According to Friedrich Hayek in ''The Use of Knowledge in Society'', prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people as they seek to satisfy their desires.<ref>Hayek, Friedrich A., ''The Use of Knowledge in Society''. 1945.

They assert that it would be the \"little guy\" who could lose more on a percentage basis, in addition to the possibility of hefty fines, rather than \"big business.\"\n\nOpponents of anti-price gouging laws also claim that in terms of [[fair value]], such laws could also require producers to sell goods below their [[market-clearing price]]: the market clearing price is the amount at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded. According to this theory, if goods are priced above their market-clearing price then there will be a surplus of goods, and the converse leads to a shortage of goods. Thus, advocates of this theory claim that consumers would be unable to buy the necessary goods which they desire in a time of need.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[neoclassical economics]], anti-price gouging laws prevent [[allocative efficiency]]. Allocative efficiency refers to when prices function properly, markets tend to allocate resources to their most valued uses. In turn those who value the good the most (and not just the wealthiest) will be willing to pay a higher price than those who do not value the good as much.<ref name=\"zwolinski3\"/> According to Friedrich Hayek in ''The Use of Knowledge in Society'', prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people as they seek to satisfy their desires.<ref>Hayek, Friedrich A., ''The Use of Knowledge in Society''. 1945.

Miloslav Kabel\u00e1\u010d belongs to the foremost Czech symphonists, whose work is sometimes compared with [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s and [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]]'s. In the communist period Kabel\u00e1\u010d's work found itself on the periphery of official attention and was performed only sporadically and in a limited choice of compositions.\n\n== Life ==\nKabel\u00e1\u010d was born in [[Prague]]. In 1928&ndash;31 he studied at the [[Prague Conservatory]] as a pupil of [[Karel Boleslav Jir\u00e1k]], simultaneously (in 1930&ndash;31) he was a pupil of [[Alois H\u00e1ba]]. In 1932&ndash;54 Kabel\u00e1\u010d was employed by Prague Radio. From 1957 to 1968 he worked as a teacher at the Prague Conservatory. During his life Kabel\u00e1\u010d was active in ''Um\u011bleck\u00e1 beseda'', in the ''Federation of Czechoslovak Composers'' and other organisations.\n\nIn the 1960s he tried to revive contacts with Western modern music and composers, but after the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] he was silenced. His works were performed only abroad from then on.\n\n==Works==\n\nMiloslav Kabel\u00e1\u010d belongs to the most distinguished Czech composers of the 20th century. He soon created a distinctive style for which the auspicious [[melody]] and [[harmony]], the ingenious [[polyphony]] and the consistent architecture of both small and large compositions are typical. His utmost expression was his conscious work with the intervals in which he emerged from non-European musical cultures. Kabel\u00e1\u010d used here, for example, artificially numbered scale - mods whose internal course has a larger range than an [[octave]]. He also denounced the term artificial [[tonality|tonal]] music, especially for the musical theoretical justification of his economical melody. In the [[interval (music)|interval]] structure, he also explored the possibilities of so-called interval [[Augmentation (music)|augmentation]] and [[diminution]], [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] and other practices brought to the music by the so-called 2nd Viennese school. The first mature compositions of this style include the [[cantata|anti-cantata]] ''Do not retreat!'' (1939), performed for the first time after the end of the Second World War (28 October 1945).\n\nAt the beginning and in the years of war, Kabel\u00e1\u010d focused on [[chamber music|chamber]] opuses (Wind Sextet, Sonata for cello and piano, Two pieces for violin and piano) and Symphonic (1st and 2nd symphonies). Over time, work with large occupation (8th symphony, Mysterium of Time, Reflections), which are his most significant works - along with songs for drums that have already come on European stages at the time (Eight Inventions for percussions). In the 1960s, which gave him wide recognition in the form of the State Prize and Foreign Orders, he received a number of stimuli from foreign avant-garde, which he had organically incorporated into his compositional morphology. He also excelled in pedagogical activities and interest in non-European cultures. He was one of the first promoters of [[electro-acoustic music]] in Czechoslovakia.\n\nNumerous choreographers have also taken up his work \"Eight Inventions for Percussion Instruments. \", Alvin Ailey with the ''American Dance Theater'' are the most prominent among them, his choreography titled Streams, was performed in Prague too in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vltava.rozhlas.cz/miloslav-kabelac-5172690|title=Miloslav Kabel\u00e1\u010d|date=2012-04-24|website=Vltava|language=cs|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===Symphonies===\n* Symphony No. 1 in D for strings and percussion, Op. 11 (1941&ndash;42)\n* Symphony No. 2 in C for large orchestra, Op. 15 (1942&ndash;46)\n* Symphony No. 3 in F for organ, brass and timpani, Op. 33 (1948&ndash;57)\n* Symphony No. 4 in A, \"Chamber Symphony\", Op. 36 (1954&ndash;58)\n* Symphony No. 5 in B flat minor, \"Dramatic\", for soprano without text, and orchestra, Op. 41 (1960)\n* Symphony No. 6 \"Concertante\", for clarinet and orchestra, Op. 44 (1961&ndash;62)\n* Symphony No. 7 for orchestra and reciter on the composer's text after the Bible, Op. 52 (1967&ndash;68)\n* [[Symphony No. 8 (Kabel\u00e1\u010d)|Symphony No. 8 \"Antiphonies\"]], for soprano, mixed choir, percussion and organ, on words from the Bible, Op. 54 (1970)\n\n===Further orchestral works===\n* Overture No. 2 for large orchestra, Op. 17 (1947)\n* ''Childish Moods''.
