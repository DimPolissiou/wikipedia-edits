The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n=== Community-made charts ===\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

It is based on the [[Fight Club (novel)|1996 novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. Norton plays [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the unnamed narrator]], who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), with a theme of conflict between [[Generation X]] and the [[value (ethics)#Value system|value system]] of advertising.<ref name=CNN1999/><ref name=Laist/>\n\nStudio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. ''The Guardian'' saw it as an omen for change in American political life, and described its visual style as ground-breaking. The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, establishing ''Fight Club'' as a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and causing media to revisit the film. On the tenth anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Dennis |title=Forget Rule No. 1: Still Talking About 'Fight Club' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/movies/homevideo/08lim.html |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is an automobile [[Product recall|recall]] specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions. He finds [[catharsis]] by posing as a sufferer of [[testicular cancer]] and other afflictions in [[support group]]s, curing his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer. The two agree to split which groups they attend.\n\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion. He is disheartened by the loss of his [[Economic materialism|material]] possessions. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to [[consumerism]]. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.\n\nThe Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.\n\nMarla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla begin a sexual relationship, much to the Narrator's irritation. Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss for his company's assets to support Fight Club and quits his job.\n\nSoon, Fight Clubs begin to form across the country. New members begin to join en masse, including Robert Paulson, a man with testicular cancer who the Narrator had previously met in a support group. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.\n\nWhen Paulson is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited. In one city, a Project Mayhem member addresses the Narrator as \"Mr. Durden.\" Confused, the Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body; the Narrator assumed the personality of Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.\n\nThe Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior and refuses to listen. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him.  With Tyler holding him by gunpoint in the top floor, the Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, which causes Tyler to collapse since he thinks he has committed suicide; the Narrator ceases [[mental projection]] of Tyler. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Brad Pitt]] (left) in 2014 and [[Edward Norton]] (right) in 2012\n| image1 = Brad Pitt June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1 = A Caucasian man with black hair and glasses.

By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.<ref name=\"smith60\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the ''Graduate'' archetype: \"a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\"<ref name=\"smith64\" /> While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\nScreenwriter [[Jim Uhls]] described the film as a [[romantic comedy]], explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Sragow |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |title=Testosterama |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=October 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209021705/http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |archive-date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler.

Before its publication, a [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.<ref name=\"mav1\">{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, [[Jim Uhls]], lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head [[Bill Mechanic]].<ref name=\"mav1\" /> In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Michael |last= Fleming |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264 |title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate= November 30, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.<ref name= mav1 /> Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5&nbsp;million.<ref name= mav2 />\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]].

He was cast in ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5&nbsp;million for ''Fight Club''. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary.

Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his subsequent, less complex film ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'': \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March 29, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nFincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]],'' but left midway through production due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\".<ref name=\"comment65\" /> The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense\u2014a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend [[patina]]\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]' technique as the influence.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\n''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].<ref name=\"comment65\" /> Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\".<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] [[Kevin Tod Haug]], who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"[[mind's eye]]\" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.<ref name=\"cinefex\">{{cite journal |first=Kevin H. |last=Martin |title=A World of Hurt |journal=[[Cinefex]] |date=January 2000 |url=http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040227070738/http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-date=February 27, 2004 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Fight Club fear center.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Blue and rough-looking tendrils stretch into a vanishing point in the middle; tendrils on the right side are visible, where the rest are obscured in darkness.

The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case |magazine=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |date=August 1999 }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive\u2014wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&nbsp;photographs of Los Angeles and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&nbsp;months.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]\u2014nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film\u2014to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\n===Score===\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing [[film score]]s would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film.

They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised ''Fight Club'' on cable during [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<ref name=\"mav4\" /> Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to ''Fight Club''{{'}}s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.<ref name=\"what\">{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Theatrical run===\nThe studio held ''Fight Club''{{'}}s world premiere at the [[56th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 10, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title='Fight Club' gets Venice premiere |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |publisher=Associated Press via [[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=September 11, 1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216182818/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |archive-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gristwood |first=Sarah |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |title=Fury of fists |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=September 14, 1999 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107181749/http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref> For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13&nbsp;million and US$15&nbsp;million in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bruce | last=Orwall | url= | title=L.A.

It is based on the [[Fight Club (novel)|1996 novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. Norton plays [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the unnamed narrator]], who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), with a theme of conflict between [[Generation X]] and the [[value (ethics)#Value system|value system]] of advertising.<ref name=CNN1999/><ref name=Laist/>\n\nStudio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. ''The Guardian'' saw it as an omen for change in American political life, and described its visual style as ground-breaking. The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, establishing ''Fight Club'' as a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and causing media to revisit the film. On the tenth anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Dennis |title=Forget Rule No. 1: Still Talking About 'Fight Club' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/movies/homevideo/08lim.html |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is an automobile [[Product recall|recall]] specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions. He finds [[catharsis]] by posing as a sufferer of [[testicular cancer]] and other afflictions in [[support group]]s, curing his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer. The two agree to split which groups they attend.\n\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion. He is disheartened by the loss of his [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] items. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to [[consumerism]]. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.\n\nThe Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.\n\nMarla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla begin a sexual relationship, much to the Narrator's irritation. Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss for his company's assets to support Fight Club and quits his job.\n\nSoon, Fight Clubs begin to form across the country. New members begin to join en masse, including Robert Paulson, a man with testicular cancer who the Narrator had previously met in a support group. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.\n\nWhen Paulson is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited. In one city, a Project Mayhem member addresses the Narrator as \"Mr. Durden.\" Confused, the Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body; the Narrator assumed the personality of Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.\n\nThe Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior and refuses to listen. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him.  With Tyler holding him by gunpoint in the top floor, the Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, which causes Tyler to collapse since he thinks he has committed suicide; the Narrator ceases [[mental projection]] of Tyler. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Brad Pitt]] (left) in 2014 and [[Edward Norton]] (right) in 2012\n| image1 = Brad Pitt June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1 = A Caucasian man with black hair and glasses.

By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.<ref name=\"smith60\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the ''Graduate'' archetype: \"a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\"<ref name=\"smith64\" /> While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\nScreenwriter [[Jim Uhls]] described the film as a [[romantic comedy]], explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Sragow |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |title=Testosterama |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=October 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209021705/http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |archive-date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler.

Before its publication, a [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.<ref name=\"mav1\">{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, [[Jim Uhls]], lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head [[Bill Mechanic]].<ref name=\"mav1\" /> In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Michael |last= Fleming |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264 |title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate= November 30, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.<ref name= mav1 /> Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5&nbsp;million.<ref name= mav2 />\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]].

He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary.

The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA.<ref name=\"comment65\" /> Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and [[#Visual effects|complex special effects]]. Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his subsequent, less complex film ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'': \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March 29, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nFincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]],'' but left midway through production due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\".<ref name=\"comment65\" /> The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense\u2014a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend [[patina]]\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]' technique as the influence.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\n''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].<ref name=\"comment65\" /> Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\".<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] [[Kevin Tod Haug]], who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"[[mind's eye]]\" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.<ref name=\"cinefex\">{{cite journal |first=Kevin H. |last=Martin |title=A World of Hurt |journal=[[Cinefex]] |date=January 2000 |url=http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040227070738/http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-date=February 27, 2004 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Fight Club fear center.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Blue and rough-looking tendrils stretch into a vanishing point in the middle; tendrils on the right side are visible, where the rest are obscured in darkness.

The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case |magazine=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |date=August 1999 }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive\u2014wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&nbsp;photographs of Los Angeles and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&nbsp;months.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]\u2014nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film\u2014to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\n===Score===\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing [[film score]]s would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued [[Radiohead]],<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> but singer [[Thom Yorke]] declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their album ''[[OK Computer]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/thom-yorke-nearly-wrote-soundtrack-fight-club-2386137|title=Thom Yorke on how he nearly wrote the soundtrack for ''Fight Club''|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|date=October 3, 2018|work=[[NME]]|access-date=October 4, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Fincher instead commissioned the [[breakbeat]] producing duo [[Dust Brothers]], who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples.

They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes.
