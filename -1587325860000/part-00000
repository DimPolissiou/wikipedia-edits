It existed until the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1977.\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing the fall of the Republic in April 1939, the [[President of Spain|President]] ([[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]]) and [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] ([[Juan Negr\u00edn]]) went into exile in [[French Third Republic|France]]. Aza\u00f1a resigned his post and died in November 1940. He was succeeded as President by [[Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio]], who had been Prime Minister in 1936. Following the [[Occupation of France]], the government was reconstituted in [[Mexico]], which under the left-wing President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] continued to recognise the Republic, although Negr\u00edn spent the war years in [[London]]. Negr\u00edn resigned as Prime Minister in 1945 and was succeeded by [[Jos\u00e9 Giral]].\n\nUntil 1945, the exiled Republicans had high hopes that at the end of [[World War II]] in Europe, Franco's regime would be removed from power by the victorious Allies and that they would be able to return to Spain. When these hopes were disappointed, the government-in-exile faded away to a purely symbolic role. The government moved back to Paris in 1946. There was also a [[Basque government in exile]] and a [[Catalan government in exile]].\n\nIn the immediate postwar period it had diplomatic relations with [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Guatemala]], [[Venezuela]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]].<ref>Yossi Shain (ed).

New York: Whittlesey House. 1948. p. 252.</ref>\n\nFollowing Franco's death in 1975, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] initiated a [[Spanish transition to democracy|democratic transition]]. In 1977 the exiled Republicans accepted the re-establishment of the monarchy and recognised Juan Carlos' government as the legitimate government of Spain. The key moment came when Socialist leaders [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Javier Solana]] met Juan Carlos at [[Zarzuela Palace]] in Madrid\u2013a tacit endorsement of the monarchy by the previously staunchly republican Socialists.\n\nOn 1 July 1977, the Government of the Spanish Republic was formally dissolved. In a gesture of reconciliation, Juan Carlos received the exile leaders at a ceremony in Madrid.\n\n== Presidents in exile ==\n{{See also|President of Spain}}\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Portrait\n!Coat of arms\n!Name\n!President From\n!President Until\n!Political Party\n|-\n!style=\"background:{{Republican Union (Spain, 1934)/meta/color}};\"| \n|[[File:Mart\u00ednez Barrio.JPG|80px]]\n|[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|80px]] \n|[[Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio]]''<br /><small>Interim</small>\n|March 3, 1939\n|May 11, 1940\n|[[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Independent (politician)/meta/color}}; color:black;\"| \n||\n|[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|80px]] \n|[[\u00c1lvaro de Albornoz|\u00c1lvaro de Albornoz y Liminiana]] ''<br /><small>Interim</small>\n|May 11, 1940\n|August 17, 1945\n|[[Independent (politician)|Independent]]\n|-\n!style=\"background:{{Republican Union (Spain, 1934)/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 1 \n|[[File:Mart\u00ednez Barrio.JPG|80px]]\n|[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|80px]] \n|[[Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio]]\n|August 17, 1945\n|January 1, 1962\n|[[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]]\n|-\n!style=\"background:{{Spanish Socialist Workers' Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 2\n||[[File:No image.png|80px]] \n|[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|80px]] \n|[[Luis Jim\u00e9nez de As\u00faa]]\n|January 1, 1962\n|November 16, 1970\n|[[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]\n|-\n!style=\"background:{{Republican Left (Spain)/meta/color}}; color:white\" | 3\n||[[File:No image.png|80px]] \n|[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|80px]] \n|[[Jos\u00e9 Maldonado Gonzalez]] \n|November 16, 1970\n|July 1, 1977\n|[[Republican Left (Spain)|Republican Left]]\n|}\n\n== Prime Ministers in exile ==\n{{See also|List of Prime Ministers of Spain}}\n\n===Spanish Republican government in exile (1939\u20131977)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; border:1px #aaf solid;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Portrait\n! style=\"width:20%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Name<br/>{{small|(Birth\u2013Death)}}\n! style=\"width:33%;\" colspan=\"3\"|Term of office\n! style=\"width:17%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Political Party\n! style=\"width:80px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[President of the Republic (Spain)|President]]<br/>{{small|(Term)}}\n|-\n! {{small|Took office}}\n! {{small|Left office}}\n! {{small|Days}}\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n! style=\"background:{{Spanish Socialist Workers' Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Juan negrin.gif|60px]] -->\n| '''[[Juan Negr\u00edn]]'''<br/>{{small|(1892\u20131956)}}\n| 31 March 1939\n| 17 August 1945\n| {{age in days|1939|3|31|1945|8|17}}\n| {{Party shading/PSOE}}|[[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]\n|[[\u00c1lvaro de Albornoz]]<br/>[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939).svg|60px]]<br/>{{small|(1939\u20131945)}}\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n! style=\"background:{{Republican Left (Spain)/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[File:D.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The station is owned by [[Indiana University]] Student Broadcasting.\n\n==Operation==\nWIUX is completely operated by student volunteers currently enrolled at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]. There are no paid employees or faculty supervisors.\n\n==History==\n* 1963 - WQAD, a [[carrier current]] AM radio station was founded in Wright Quadrangle at Indiana University, with a frequency of 730&nbsp;kHz. The studios were originally in Todd House (through the odd entryway on the south side of Todd) and later in Elliott House (in the basement storage area, off the lounge area). WQAD beamed its programming to Wright Quadrangle, Teter Quadrangle, Read Center, Forest Quadrangle and what was then known as the Graduate Residence Center or GRC for the first time on 730 AM via carrier current throughout Wright Quad on January 5, 1963. The station was started by physics major Bill Weaverling, chemistry major Steve Peterson, and education major Jerry Pugh.  As a note, at the time of WQAD, Wright Quadrangle housed only men.\n* 1964 - WFQR Radio, also a carrier current AM radio station, was founded in Foster Quadrangle; the call letters stood for \"Foster Quadrangle Radio.\"  Its programming was beamed to the dormitories along Fee Lane, including Foster, McNutt and Briscoe Quadrangles.\n* 1965 - WFQR Radio changed its call letters to WIN, and continued to operate from Foster Quadrangle.\n* 1966 - Phil Murphy formed the Indiana University Radio Network (IURN) to combine sales for both student stations.  At times during the 1966-67 school year, each station originated a \"network feed\" which was sent to the carrier current transmitters of all wired student housing.  At other times for this final school year, WIN and WQAD maintained separate programming.\n* September 1967 - The two stations merge to form WIUS Radio, still strictly a carrier current operation.  It was supposed to be at 620&nbsp;kHz in all student housing, but until the end of carrier current operations, some transmitters continued to operate at 730&nbsp;kHz.  The original WIUS studios were located at 617 E. 8th St., today the site of the [[Mathers Museum of World Cultures]].  The building, a two-story brick house, once belonged to a Bloomington mayor and to legendary Indiana University swimming coach James \"Doc\" Counsilman.  All IU undergraduate dormitories are wired, and an ambitious plan to wire graduate housing and IU fraternities and sororities is unveiled; little of this plan is ever accomplished.\n* October 10, 1972 - On the first day of National Fire Prevention Week, a pre-dawn fire destroyed the original WIUS studios.  The fire was arson, set in at least two locations, the sales office at the front of the building and the administrative offices in the rear; the person or persons responsible have never been arrested.  For one week, WIUS programming aired from a spare studio of the Indiana University Radio and Television Service.  WIUS then relocated until Spring Break of 1973 to the old Elliott House WQAD studios, using salvaged and borrowed equipment, records that survived the fire and records from student DJ collections.\n* March 1973 - WIUS moves over spring break from Elliott House into a house at 815 E. 8th St., two blocks from the previous WIUS house.\n[[Image:WQAX Logo 1970.png|right|thumb|300px|WQAX Logo from 1970s]]\n* September 1973 - The IU Student Broadcast Corporation, a not-for-profit student corporation, creates a new radio station, WQAX, partly out of frustrated efforts to get WIUS onto the off-campus cable TV system; the attitude of one IU administrator towards the idea was quoted at the time as \"Students shouldn't be talking to townspeople.\"  Many of the first WQAX programmers were former WIUS members, and the two stations maintained a friendly rivalry as WIUS finally gained access to its own cable FM frequency.\n* Spring 1974 -  In addition to carrier current, WIUS begins to air its programming on the local Bloomington, Ind., cable TV system, then owned by Monroe Cablevision, at 95.1 mHz.  Broadcasts to IU dormitories and a select number of fraternities and sororities (notably [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Evans Scholars]] and the houses surrounding them) remained carrier current, although after 1977 the carrier current system was allowed to deteriorate and reception was often spotty or absent in certain dormitories.  It wasn't until the late 1980s that the IU dormitories would be wired for cable; as soon as they were, WIUS became exclusively cable-accessible.\n* 1973 to 1993 - WQAX, identified on-air as \"Quacks,\" was a college/community access radio station at 100.3&nbsp;MHz (non-broadcast) on the local cable TV system in Bloomington, Ind.  The station was free-form and volunteer-driven. It offered Indiana University students, wanna-be DJs, music maniacs, and local eccentrics a way to learn about radio. And it added, for a defined period of time, a yet-to-be duplicated brand of insanity to the local landscape.  Originally operating from an office in the Indiana Memorial Union, supplied by the IU Student Association, which assisted in its founding as an alternative to the then-tightly formatted contemporary hit rock WIUS programming, WQAX studios moved several times during its 20-year life.\n* 1985 - After several years of sometimes sporadic broadcasts and funding so bad that portions of the WIUS House were rented out as student apartments, a group of students dedicated to IU radio formed a committee to search out money for WIUS\u2014and with the university's help they provided funding to help improve the station. This funding lasted until the end of the decade.\n* 1993 - WQAX was forced to close for want of money (or, some have maintained, taken an extended hiatus). Most of its music library and equipment were dispersed.

Since 1981, [[WIUS]]-FM has operated as the FCC-licensed, student-operated FM station at Western Illinois University.

The move comes as Indiana University makes plans to build a new fraternity house on 8th Street between Woodlawn Avenue and Park Avenue. \n* July 2017 - WIUX moves from its house into Franklin Hall, home of the new IU media school.\n\n==FCC/Right to broadcast controversy==\nOn October 31, 2006, WIUX announced on its website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiux.org/new/dj-letter/|title=WIUX|website=Wiux.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] was granting the 100.3 mHz frequency to a Class A FM radio station in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], taking over the frequency WIUX had been granted only the previous year.  Because the Indiana University student-based station operates as a Low Power station, the FCC maintains that it has the right to move the station or remove it from the air. Indiana University filed a petition against the move. The Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Affairs at Indiana University, [[Richard McKaig]], states in the official petition (available through the WIUX website): \"The Indiana frequency did not appear on the Commission\u2019s internet site or on a public notice until after the comment reply date of June 13, 2006 deadline. As a result, we did not have a fair chance to file public comments.\" On November 6, both Indiana senators, Evan Bayh (Dem) and Richard Lugar (Rep), wrote petitions of support for WIUX to the FCC.\n\nOn June 4, 2007 WIUX moved from 100.3 FM to 99.1 FM.\n\n==Radio format==\nWIUX is a [[variety (radio)|variety]] [[radio format]] [[college radio]] station. It features music of different genres, news, sports, and talk programming. Students broadcast live play-by-play of Indiana Hoosiers football, men's and women's basketball, and men's and women's soccer.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2016 and 2020, WIUX won \"Best college radio station in America\" in the [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]] Awards.  \nIn 2009, WIUX was nominated for the [[mtvU]] Woodie Award for best college radio station in America.\n\n==Culture Shock==\nCulture Shock is a free yearly festival traditionally held in Dunn Meadow or 3rd St. Park by WIUX.

The station is owned by [[Indiana University]] Student Broadcasting.\n\n==Operation==\nWIUX is completely operated by student volunteers currently enrolled at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]. There are no paid employees or faculty supervisors.\n\n==History==\n* 1963 - WQAD, a [[carrier current]] AM radio station was founded in Wright Quadrangle at Indiana University, with a frequency of 730&nbsp;kHz. The studios were originally in Todd House (through the odd entryway on the south side of Todd) and later in Elliott House (in the basement storage area, off the lounge area). WQAD beamed its programming to Wright Quadrangle, Teter Quadrangle, Read Center, Forest Quadrangle and what was then known as the Graduate Residence Center or GRC for the first time on 730 AM via carrier current throughout Wright Quad on January 5, 1963. The station was started by physics major Bill Weaverling, chemistry major Steve Peterson, and education major Jerry Pugh.  As a note, at the time of WQAD, Wright Quadrangle housed only men.\n* 1964 - WFQR Radio, also a carrier current AM radio station, was founded in Foster Quadrangle; the call letters stood for \"Foster Quadrangle Radio.\"  Its programming was beamed to the dormitories along Fee Lane, including Foster, McNutt and Briscoe Quadrangles.\n* 1965 - WFQR Radio changed its call letters to WIN, and continued to operate from Foster Quadrangle.\n* 1966 - Phil Murphy formed the Indiana University Radio Network (IURN) to combine sales for both student stations.  At times during the 1966-67 school year, each station originated a \"network feed\" which was sent to the carrier current transmitters of all wired student housing.  At other times for this final school year, WIN and WQAD maintained separate programming.\n* September 1967 - The two stations merge to form WIUS Radio, still strictly a carrier current operation.  It was supposed to be at 620&nbsp;kHz in all student housing, but until the end of carrier current operations, some transmitters continued to operate at 730&nbsp;kHz.  The original WIUS studios were located at 617 E. 8th St., today the site of the [[Mathers Museum of World Cultures]].  The building, a two-story brick house, once belonged to a Bloomington mayor and to legendary Indiana University swimming coach James \"Doc\" Counsilman.  All IU undergraduate dormitories are wired, and an ambitious plan to wire graduate housing and IU fraternities and sororities is unveiled; little of this plan is ever accomplished.\n* October 10, 1972 - On the first day of National Fire Prevention Week, a pre-dawn fire destroyed the original WIUS studios.  The fire was arson, set in at least two locations, the sales office at the front of the building and the administrative offices in the rear; the person or persons responsible have never been arrested.  For one week, WIUS programming aired from a spare studio of the Indiana University Radio and Television Service.  WIUS then relocated until Spring Break of 1973 to the old Elliott House WQAD studios, using salvaged and borrowed equipment, records that survived the fire and records from student DJ collections.\n* March 1973 - WIUS moves over spring break from Elliott House into a house at 815 E. 8th St., two blocks from the previous WIUS house.\n[[Image:WQAX Logo 1970.png|right|thumb|300px|WQAX Logo from 1970s]]\n* September 1973 - The IU Student Broadcast Corporation, a not-for-profit student corporation, creates a new radio station, WQAX, partly out of frustrated efforts to get WIUS onto the off-campus cable TV system; the attitude of one IU administrator towards the idea was quoted at the time as \"Students shouldn't be talking to townspeople.\"  Many of the first WQAX programmers were former WIUS members, and the two stations maintained a friendly rivalry as WIUS finally gained access to its own cable FM frequency.\n* Spring 1974 -  In addition to carrier current, WIUS begins to air its programming on the local Bloomington, Ind., cable TV system, then owned by Monroe Cablevision, at 95.1 mHz.  Broadcasts to IU dormitories and a select number of fraternities and sororities (notably [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Evans Scholars]] and the houses surrounding them) remained carrier current, although after 1977 the carrier current system was allowed to deteriorate and reception was often spotty or absent in certain dormitories.  It wasn't until the late 1980s that the IU dormitories would be wired for cable; as soon as they were, WIUS became exclusively cable-accessible.\n* 1973 to 1993 - WQAX, identified on-air as \"Quacks,\" was a college/community access radio station at 100.3&nbsp;MHz (non-broadcast) on the local cable TV system in Bloomington, Ind.  The station was free-form and volunteer-driven. It offered Indiana University students, wanna-be DJs, music maniacs, and local eccentrics a way to learn about radio. And it added, for a defined period of time, a yet-to-be duplicated brand of insanity to the local landscape.  Originally operating from an office in the Indiana Memorial Union, supplied by the IU Student Association, which assisted in its founding as an alternative to the then-tightly formatted contemporary hit rock WIUS programming, WQAX studios moved several times during its 20-year life.\n* 1985 - After several years of sometimes sporadic broadcasts and funding so bad that portions of the WIUS House were rented out as student apartments, a group of students dedicated to IU radio formed a committee to search out money for WIUS\u2014and with the university's help they provided funding to help improve the station. This funding lasted until the end of the decade.\n* 1993 - WQAX was forced to close for want of money (or, some have maintained, taken an extended hiatus). Most of its music library and equipment were dispersed. Its members, who over the years numbered in the hundreds, likewise scattered.\n\n[[Image:WIUX Contour Map.gif|right|thumb|300px|WIUX Contour Map [FCC file: FL1104780]]\n\n* 1994 - WIUS was allowed a portion of the student activity fee for each of the following two school years. This funding allowed WIUS to further its evolution, and it added open-air AM broadcasts beginning October 3, from a low-power transmitter, identical to those used for roadside traffic reports in any cities, atop the Indiana University Library, broadcasting to an approximately three-mile radius at 1570&nbsp;kHz, while maintaining its cable FM presence.

The programme, ''Tonight With Trevor McDonald \u2013 Major Fraud'', was broadcast on ITV on 21 April 2003 (a month after the trial began), and credited with over 17 million viewers. On 9 May 2003 (the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US as a special episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]''), the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\n=== Trial ===\nFollowing [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]\" on 7 April 2003. Both of the Ingrams and Whittock were given prison sentences [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to eighteen months and Whittock was sentenced to twelve months), each fined \u00a315,000, and each ordered to pay \u00a310,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram \u00a340,000 and Diana Ingram \u00a325,000.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, when the correct answer had been spoken.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, when the correct answer had been spoken.
