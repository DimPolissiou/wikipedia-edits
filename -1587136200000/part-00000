Its territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s.\n\nPortugal is the oldest [[nation state]] on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in [[Europe]], its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

During this time Portugal monopolized the [[spice trade]], [[Treaty of Tordesillas|divided the world into hemispheres of dominion with Castille]], and the empire expanded with military campaigns in [[Portuguese presence in Asia|Asia]]. However, events such as the [[Lisbon Earthquake|1755 Lisbon earthquake]], the country's occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the independence of Brazil (1822) erased to a great extent [[Economic history of Portugal|Portugal's prior opulence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese First Republic]] was established, later being superseded by the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974), ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]]. The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|handover of Macau to China]] (1999) marked the end of what can be considered the [[Portuguese Empire|longest-lived colonial empire]].\n\nPortugal has left a profound cultural, architectural and linguistic influence [[Evolution of the Portuguese Empire|across the globe]], with a legacy of around 250 million [[Lusophone|Portuguese speakers]], and many [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese-based creoles]].

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, however, scholars like Jean Markale andTranoy, propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. <ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref><ref> https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/2852/9.3.pdf </ref><ref> https://archive.org/stream/originesetmigrat00peti/originesetmigrat00peti_djvu.txt </ref>\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe.

The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

We bury the dead and take care of the living.\"\n\nDespite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children.

The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | footer =\n | image1 = Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real para o Brasil - Nicolas-Louis-Albert Delerive, attrib.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\n\nPortugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&nbsp;\u2013 People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.\n\n=== Presidency of the Republic ===\n{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}\n[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Bel\u00e9m Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]\n\nThe Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]]. He or she has also supervision and [[reserve power]]s. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.\n\n=== Government ===\n\n{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}\n\n[[File:Lisboa April 2014-15a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]\n\nThe Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.\n\nIt has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization, about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly.\n\nThe [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] \u2013 under the presidency of the Prime Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers) \u2013 acts as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Parliament ===\n[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (Sharon Hahn Darlin) S\u00e3o Bento.jpg|thumb|right|[[S\u00e3o Bento Palace]] is the seat of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Legislature]].]]\n{{main|Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|List of political parties in Portugal}}\n\nThe [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], in Lisbon, is the national [[parliament]] of Portugal. It is the main legislative body, although the Government also has limited legislative powers.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats. The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|CDS-PP]] parties form the opposition to the government alongside [[People\u2013Animals\u2013Nature|PAN]], Chega, Iniciativa Liberal and Partido Livre.\n\n=== Law and drug policy ===\n[[File:Campus Justi\u00e7a (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Lisbon's Campus of Justice]]\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: \"Law of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{main|Judiciary of Portugal|Law of Portugal|Drug policy of Portugal|LGBT rights in Portugal}}\nThe Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures.

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male).

Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]].

All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic.

Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[Reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     =\n | image1    = Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg\n | image2    = Santu\u00e1rio de F\u00e1tima (3) - Jul 2008.jpg\n | footer    = The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King Sanctuary]] and the [[Sanctuary of F\u00e1tima|Shrine of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] in Portugal are two of the world's most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites.\n }}\n\nThe growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910\u201326) changed the role and importance of organized religion.\n\nPortugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]].

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Chainho]], [[M\u00edsia]], [[Dulce Pontes]] and [[Madredeus]].\n\nIn the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianists [[Artur Pizarro]], [[Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires]], [[Sequeira Costa]], the violinists Carlos Damas, [[Gerardo Ribeiro]] and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]].

It is the westernmost [[sovereign state]] of [[mainland Europe]], being bordered to the west and south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the north and east by [[Spain]]. Its territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s.\n\nPortugal is the oldest [[nation state]] on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in [[Europe]], its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

During this time Portugal monopolized the [[spice trade]], [[Treaty of Tordesillas|divided the world into hemispheres of dominion with Castille]], and the empire expanded with military campaigns in [[Portuguese presence in Asia|Asia]]. However, events such as the [[Lisbon Earthquake|1755 Lisbon earthquake]], the country's occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the independence of Brazil (1822) erased to a great extent [[Economic history of Portugal|Portugal's prior opulence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese First Republic]] was established, later being superseded by the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974), ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]].

This was one of the oldest civilizational settlements of the '''Iberian peninsula''', and of the whole '''Europe'''.  \n\nThe name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, however, scholars like Jean Markale andTranoy, propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. <ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref><ref> https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/2852/9.3.pdf </ref><ref> https://archive.org/stream/originesetmigrat00peti/originesetmigrat00peti_djvu.txt </ref>\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal).

The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal).

With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area.

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal.

He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Boars were found recently roaming at night inside large urban areas, like in [[Setubal]]. [[Protected areas of Portugal]] include one national park, 12 natural parks, nine natural reserves, five natural monuments, and seven protected landscapes, which include the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-Ger\u00eas]], the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] and the [[Paul de Arzila|Paul d'Arzila]].\n\nThese natural environments are shaped by diverse flora, and include widespread species of pine (especially the ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' and ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' species), the English oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), the Pyrenean oak (''[[Quercus pyrenaica]]'') the chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), the cork-oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') or the Portuguese oak (''[[Quercus faginea]]''). Due to their economic value, some species of the genus ''Eucalyptus'' were introduced and are now common, despite their environmental impact.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300|align=left\n| image1 = Estrela Mountain Dog 6 month old male.jpg  |width1 = 736 |height1 = 541\n| image4 = Estrela Mar\u00e7o 2010-40.jpg |width4 = 3872 |height4 = 2700\n| image3 = Abejaruco.jpg  |width3 = 1600 |height3 = 1200\n| image2 = Loutre des pyrenees baronnies 2004.jpg |width2 = 594  |height2 = 394\n| footer = Left-to-right: an [[Estrela Mountain Dog]], a [[Eurasian otter]], a [[European bee-eater]], and a [[Lusitano]] horse\n}}\n[[Laurisilva]] is a unique type of subtropical rainforest, which nowadays, in Europe, is only restricted to the Iberian Peninsula: in the Azores, and in particular on the island of Madeira, there are large forests of endemic ''Laurisilva'' (the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve).\nThere are several species of diverse [[mammal]]ian fauna, including the [[fox]], [[badger]], [[iberian lynx]], [[iberian wolf]], [[wild goat]] (''[[Capra pyrenaica]]''), wild cat (''[[Felis silvestris]]''), [[hare]], [[weasel]], [[European polecat|polecat]], [[chameleon]], [[mongoose]], [[civet]], the occasional [[brown bear]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190509-first-brown-bear-sighting-portugal-over-century|title=First brown bear sighting in Portugal in over a century|date=9 May 2019|website=France 24}}</ref> and many others. Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds, in places such as [[Cape St. Vincent]] or the [[Serra de Monchique|Monchique]] mountains, where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring (return migration).\n\nMost of the avian species congregate along the [[Iberian Peninsula]] since it is the closest stopover between Northern Europe and Africa. Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal (either for nesting or during the course of migration), and annually there are new registries of nesting species. The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American, European, and African birds, while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species.\n\nThere are more than 100 freshwater fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western portion of country, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe on some beaches.\n\nThere are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macaronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal. In Madeira, for example, it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land [[gastropods]].\n\n== Government and administration ==\n{{Main|Government of Portugal|Politics of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 220\n\n | image1 = Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa em fevereiro de 2018.jpg\n | width1 = 514 | height1 = 728\n | caption1 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], [[List of Presidents of Portugal|20th]] [[President of Portugal]]</div>\n\n | image2 = Ant\u00f3nio Costa em 2017.jpg\n | width2 = 824 | height2 = 1152\n | caption2 = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|119th]] [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]</div>\n\n }}\nPortugal has been a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] since the ratification of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Constitution of 1976]], with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.

The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\n\nPortugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&nbsp;\u2013 People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.\n\n=== Presidency of the Republic ===\n{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}\n[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Bel\u00e9m Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]\n\nThe Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]].

Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.\n\n=== Government ===\n\n{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}\n\n[[File:Lisboa April 2014-15a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]\n\nThe Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.\n\nIt has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative powers.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain share the world's oldest active military accord through their [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] ([[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]), which was signed in 1373.\n\nThere are two international territorial disputes, both with Spain:\n* [[Olivenza]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]].

The Navy (10,700 personnel, of which 1,580 are [[Portuguese Marines|marines]]), the world's oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines, and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the [[Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet]] as the main combat aircraft.\n\nIn addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]], a security force subject to military law and organization ([[gendarmerie]]) comprising 25,000 personnel.

The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures.

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male).

Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]].

All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic.

Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[Reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     =\n | image1    = Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg\n | image2    = Santu\u00e1rio de F\u00e1tima (3) - Jul 2008.jpg\n | footer    = The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King Sanctuary]] and the [[Sanctuary of F\u00e1tima|Shrine of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] in Portugal are two of the world's most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites.\n }}\n\nThe growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910\u201326) changed the role and importance of organized religion.\n\nPortugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]].

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Chainho]], [[M\u00edsia]], [[Dulce Pontes]] and [[Madredeus]].\n\nIn the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianists [[Artur Pizarro]], [[Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires]], [[Sequeira Costa]], the violinists Carlos Damas, [[Gerardo Ribeiro]] and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]].

Along with his five World titles, McBeth has received the PDGA Male Player of the year three times (2013, 2014, 2015). On October 8, 2019 McBeth held a PDGA rating of 1060 which is currently the highest rating achieved by a professional disc golfer. This was exceeded by March 13th, 2020, when he was rated 1061.\n\n===2015 season===\nMcBeth dominated the 2015 season, winning 19 of 25 events by an average of almost 6 strokes and finishing in the top 3 in every event. He won all five Major events, disc golf's first Grand Slam, including his fourth World title and his first ever win at the USDGC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allthingsdiscgolf.com/moment-2015-season/ |title=The Moment of the 2015 Season|author= Van Den Heuvel, A.}}</ref> making him only the third man to win both the World and US titles in the same year (after [[Ken Climo]] and [[Barry Schultz]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.innovadiscs.com/tournaments/nt-series-finale-leads-to-excitement/ |title= NT series finale leads to excitement}}</ref> McBeth also took home three NT wins and earned enough points to win the National Tour for the fourth straight year.\n\n===2016 season===\n2016 started off looking like a continuation of McBeth's commanding 2015 season. After winning a B-Tier event in California, McBeth won the Memorial Championship (NT), followed by the La Mirada Open, the first event of the Disc Golf World Tour (DGWT). At the Nick Hyde Memorial (A-Tier), McBeth lost in a sudden death playoff with [[Nathan Sexton|Nate Sexton]] and [[Simon Lizotte]], who went on to win the event. Over the next three events, McBeth lost the Glass Blown Open (NT) by one stroke to Cam Todd, the Konopiste Open (DGWT) in a playoff to Lizotte, and the Masters Cup by one stroke to [[Ricky Wysocki]] on a 70-foot putt. Citing knee pain as the reason for his falling putting percentage,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/06/01/mcbeth-plans-change-putting-style-combat-knee-pain/|title=McBeth Plans Putting Style Change To Combat Knee Pain\n}}</ref> McBeth switched to a straddle stance for the European Open (DGWT), an event he hasn\u2019t lost since 2011. The switch was effective, and McBeth bested Wysocki by two strokes to win the event. Back home in the United States, however, McBeth's struggles continued. He placed 3rd in the Beaver State Fling (NT), and then tied for 12th place in the Vibram Open (NT), his lowest finish in three years. After another one stroke loss to Wysocki at the European Masters (DGWT), McBeth took another 12th-place finish at the Majestic. Wysocki continued his incredible season with his first World title, beating McBeth by 6 strokes and ending his 4-year winning streak. Feeling healthy and his form back in check,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/08/22/mcbeth-dominates-run-away-ledgestone-win/|title=McBeth Dominates to Run Away with Ledgestone Win}}</ref> McBeth took a commanding  12 stroke win at the Ledgestone Insurance Open the next week, followed by an 11 stroke victory at the Brent Hambrick Memorial Open (NT). McBeth finished the National Tour in second place behind Wysocki, ending another 4-year streak. At the end of the inaugural Disc Golf Pro Tour, McBeth placed 4th in the Green Mountain Championship, resulting in a 5th-place finish in the points standings and an automatic berth into the Tour Championship semifinals, which he would go on to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dgpt.com/standings|title=Disc Golf Pro Tour Men's Standings}}</ref> McBeth donated his $10,000 winnings from the Tour Championship to help pay his cousin's medical bills, who was injured in an accident.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/09/19/mcbeth-takes-dgpt-championship-donates-10k-check-injured-cousin/ |title=McBeth Takes DGPT Championship, Donates $10K Check To Injured Cousin |author= Hill, S.}}</ref> The 2016 season ended on a low note for McBeth: he finished in 20th place at the USDGC, shooting 2 over par after 3 rounds (the final round was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew). Additionally, a scoring error in round 3 resulted in a two stroke penalty. Without the two stroke error, McBeth would have finished in 14th place, earning enough points to win the inaugural Disc Golf World Tour, but he instead took second place to Wysocki by just 75 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discgolfworldtour.com/usdgc-round-4-gets-cancelled-koling-new-us-dgwt-champion-wysocki-wins-dgwt-points-title/ |title=USDGC 2016 Event, Tour & Points Winners}}</ref>\n\n===2017 season===\nMcBeth entered a total of 24 tournaments <ref>https://www.pdga.com/player/27523/stats/2017</ref> in 2017, winning 9 of them, and placing 2nd or 3rd in 12 others.

After posting a very un-McBeth-like 5-over par through only 13 holes during round 2, he decided to withdraw rather than face a prolonged injury. \u201cYeah, I hurt [my back] yesterday but didn\u2019t know how bad until today,\u201d McBeth said in a text message. \u201cCouldn\u2019t throw well so tried to play it out but it got too painful. Different spot [than my previous back injury] so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not too bad. If it was the final day probably would have tried to finish it. Way too much golf left to push it with USDGC next.\u201d <ref>https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/livewire/mcbeth-withdraws-green-mountain-championship/</ref> He would end up finishing 3rd in the USDGC Championship three weeks later.\n\nFor the season, he pocketed $69,411.25 in winnings, including a $10,000 payout for winning the PDGA National Tour Elite Series.<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34054#MPO</ref>\n\n===2018 season===\nPaul McBeth's 2018 campaign was very similar to 2017, in terms of the number of tournaments he entered and won. Out of his 25 tournament appearances, McBeth notched 9 wins and finished 2nd or 3rd in 9 others.\n\nHis only major win of the year was the [[United States Disc Golf Championship|USDGC Championship]] on the Winthrop University Gold Course in Rock Hill, South Carolina. It was his 2nd USDGC victory (previous win was in 2015). McBeth got off to a blistering start, jumping out to a 7-stroke lead over [https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2017/12/27/2017-mens-breakout-player-year-james-conrad/ James Conrad] after two rounds. Conrad would eventually close the gap and tie McBeth after he cooled off over the final two rounds,<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746#MPO</ref> but McBeth prevailed with a -34 to Conrad's -31. Relative newcomer [https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2018/12/01/kevin-jones-joins-prodigy/ Kevin Jones], who came within one stroke of tying McBeth on the back nine, eventually finished 3rd, four strokes back.<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746</ref> This tournament was also notable for the fact that it featured live online coverage with Paul McBeth's wife Hannah providing on-course commentary.\n\nOn July 7, 2018 he had a historic round when he recorded a score of 18 under par (in 18 holes) during the second round on the Toboggan Course at the Great Lakes Open (McBeth would cruise to victory in the tournament).<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34230#MPO</ref> It was called \"Near Perfect\" and the round was featured on ESPN's [[SportsCenter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdga.com/news/mcbeth-shoots-18-under-par-great-lakes-open|title=McBeth Shoots 18 Under Par at Great Lakes Open|last=Hill|first=Steve|date=|website=Professional Disc Golf Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2018/07/08/mcbeth-hits-18-par-1108-glos-second-day/|title=McBeth's 18-Under Par Round Featured On Exclusive ESPN SportsCenter Segment|last=Colucci|first=Alex|date=July 9, 2018|website=Disc Golf Ultiworld|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDisc Golf video specialists [https://www.jomezpro.com/ Jomez Pro] commemorated the round with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=352G0B4OClU '''this video'''].\n\nIn all, McBeth finished with $57,880.00 for the season.

On October 8, 2019 McBeth held a PDGA rating of 1060 which is currently the highest rating achieved by a professional disc golfer. This was exceeded by March 13th, 2020, when he was rated 1061.\n\n===2015 season===\nMcBeth dominated the 2015 season, winning 19 of 25 events by an average of almost 6 strokes and finishing in the top 3 in every event. He won all five Major events, disc golf's first Grand Slam, including his fourth World title and his first ever win at the USDGC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allthingsdiscgolf.com/moment-2015-season/ |title=The Moment of the 2015 Season|author= Van Den Heuvel, A.}}</ref> making him only the third man to win both the World and US titles in the same year (after [[Ken Climo]] and [[Barry Schultz]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.innovadiscs.com/tournaments/nt-series-finale-leads-to-excitement/ |title= NT series finale leads to excitement}}</ref> McBeth also took home three NT wins and earned enough points to win the National Tour for the fourth straight year.\n\n===2016 season===\n2016 started off looking like a continuation of McBeth's commanding 2015 season. After winning a B-Tier event in California, McBeth won the Memorial Championship (NT), followed by the La Mirada Open, the first event of the Disc Golf World Tour (DGWT). At the Nick Hyde Memorial (A-Tier), McBeth lost in a sudden death playoff with [[Nathan Sexton|Nate Sexton]] and [[Simon Lizotte]], who went on to win the event. Over the next three events, McBeth lost the Glass Blown Open (NT) by one stroke to Cam Todd, the Konopiste Open (DGWT) in a playoff to Lizotte, and the Masters Cup by one stroke to [[Ricky Wysocki]] on a 70-foot putt. Citing knee pain as the reason for his falling putting percentage,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/06/01/mcbeth-plans-change-putting-style-combat-knee-pain/|title=McBeth Plans Putting Style Change To Combat Knee Pain\n}}</ref> McBeth switched to a straddle stance for the European Open (DGWT), an event he hasn\u2019t lost since 2011. The switch was effective, and McBeth bested Wysocki by two strokes to win the event. Back home in the United States, however, McBeth's struggles continued. He placed 3rd in the Beaver State Fling (NT), and then tied for 12th place in the Vibram Open (NT), his lowest finish in three years. After another one stroke loss to Wysocki at the European Masters (DGWT), McBeth took another 12th-place finish at the Majestic. Wysocki continued his incredible season with his first World title, beating McBeth by 6 strokes and ending his 4-year winning streak. Feeling healthy and his form back in check,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/08/22/mcbeth-dominates-run-away-ledgestone-win/|title=McBeth Dominates to Run Away with Ledgestone Win}}</ref> McBeth took a commanding  12 stroke win at the Ledgestone Insurance Open the next week, followed by an 11 stroke victory at the Brent Hambrick Memorial Open (NT). McBeth finished the National Tour in second place behind Wysocki, ending another 4-year streak. At the end of the inaugural Disc Golf Pro Tour, McBeth placed 4th in the Green Mountain Championship, resulting in a 5th-place finish in the points standings and an automatic berth into the Tour Championship semifinals, which he would go on to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dgpt.com/standings|title=Disc Golf Pro Tour Men's Standings}}</ref> McBeth donated his $10,000 winnings from the Tour Championship to help pay his cousin's medical bills, who was injured in an accident.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2016/09/19/mcbeth-takes-dgpt-championship-donates-10k-check-injured-cousin/ |title=McBeth Takes DGPT Championship, Donates $10K Check To Injured Cousin |author= Hill, S.}}</ref> The 2016 season ended on a low note for McBeth: he finished in 20th place at the USDGC, shooting 2 over par after 3 rounds (the final round was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew). Additionally, a scoring error in round 3 resulted in a two stroke penalty. Without the two stroke error, McBeth would have finished in 14th place, earning enough points to win the inaugural Disc Golf World Tour, but he instead took second place to Wysocki by just 75 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discgolfworldtour.com/usdgc-round-4-gets-cancelled-koling-new-us-dgwt-champion-wysocki-wins-dgwt-points-title/ |title=USDGC 2016 Event, Tour & Points Winners}}</ref>\n\n===2017 season===\nMcBeth entered a total of 24 tournaments <ref>https://www.pdga.com/player/27523/stats/2017</ref> in 2017, winning 9 of them, and placing 2nd or 3rd in 12 others. His only major win of the season came at the [[European Open (disc golf)|European Open in Nokia, Finland]], where he bested [https://www.innovadiscs.com/team/gregg-barsby/ Gregg Barsby] by only one stroke. For the second consecutive year, he finished runner-up to [[Ricky Wysocki]] in the 2017 PDGA Professional Disc Golf World Championships.<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/30813#MPO</ref> McBeth's hottest streak of the season came during the spring months of March through May, where he won 5 of the 7 tournaments he entered and placed 2nd in the other two. Notable tournaments won during this streak were the DGPT Memorial Championship,<ref>[http://memorialchampionship.com/ DGPT Memorial Championship]</ref> the Nick Hyde Memorial,<ref>[https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/30556 Nick Hyde Memorial]</ref> the Glass Blown Open,<ref>[http://glassblownopen.com/ Glass Blown Open]</ref> and the Masters Cup presented by Innova Disc Golf.<ref>[https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/30465 Masters Cup presented by Innova Disc Golf]</ref>\n\nHe notably had to withdraw from a significant tournament, Discraft's Green Mountain Championship,<ref>[https://www.smuggs.com/pages/summer/discGolf/green-mtn-championships/ Discraft's Green Mountain Championship]</ref> citing back pain. After posting a very un-McBeth-like 5-over par through only 13 holes during round 2, he decided to withdraw rather than face a prolonged injury. \u201cYeah, I hurt [my back] yesterday but didn\u2019t know how bad until today,\u201d McBeth said in a text message. \u201cCouldn\u2019t throw well so tried to play it out but it got too painful. Different spot [than my previous back injury] so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not too bad. If it was the final day probably would have tried to finish it. Way too much golf left to push it with USDGC next.\u201d <ref>https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/livewire/mcbeth-withdraws-green-mountain-championship/</ref> He would end up finishing 3rd in the USDGC Championship three weeks later.\n\nFor the season, he pocketed $69,411.25 in winnings, including a $10,000 payout for winning the PDGA National Tour Elite Series.<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34054#MPO</ref>\n\n===2018 season===\nPaul McBeth's 2018 campaign was very similar to 2017, in terms of the number of tournaments he entered and won. Out of his 25 tournament appearances, McBeth notched 9 wins and finished 2nd or 3rd in 9 others.\n\nHis only major win of the year was the [[United States Disc Golf Championship|USDGC Championship]] on the Winthrop University Gold Course in Rock Hill, South Carolina. It was his 2nd USDGC victory (previous win was in 2015). McBeth got off to a blistering start, jumping out to a 7-stroke lead over [https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2017/12/27/2017-mens-breakout-player-year-james-conrad/ James Conrad] after two rounds. Conrad would eventually close the gap and tie McBeth after he cooled off over the final two rounds,<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746#MPO</ref> but McBeth prevailed with a -34 to Conrad's -31. Relative newcomer [https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2018/12/01/kevin-jones-joins-prodigy/ Kevin Jones], who came within one stroke of tying McBeth on the back nine, eventually finished 3rd, four strokes back.<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746</ref> This tournament was also notable for the fact that it featured live online coverage with Paul McBeth's wife Hannah providing on-course commentary.\n\nOn July 7, 2018 he had a historic round when he recorded a score of 18 under par (in 18 holes) during the second round on the Toboggan Course at the Great Lakes Open (McBeth would cruise to victory in the tournament).<ref>https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34230#MPO</ref> It was called \"Near Perfect\" and the round was featured on ESPN's [[SportsCenter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdga.com/news/mcbeth-shoots-18-under-par-great-lakes-open|title=McBeth Shoots 18 Under Par at Great Lakes Open|last=Hill|first=Steve|date=|website=Professional Disc Golf Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2018/07/08/mcbeth-hits-18-par-1108-glos-second-day/|title=McBeth's 18-Under Par Round Featured On Exclusive ESPN SportsCenter Segment|last=Colucci|first=Alex|date=July 9, 2018|website=Disc Golf Ultiworld|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDisc Golf video specialists [https://www.jomezpro.com/ Jomez Pro] commemorated the round with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=352G0B4OClU '''this video'''].\n\nIn all, McBeth finished with $57,880.00 for the season.

Majumdar]] says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of [[Sindh]], their only conquest for nearly 300 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A.

At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was Mewar. The Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, although a number of Rajput kingdoms eventually became subservient to the [[Delhi Sultanate]].\n \nThe Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur.\n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{main|Wildlife of Rajasthan}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:1em; float:right; width:25%;\"\n|+ '''State symbols of '''Rajasthan'''\n|-\n| '''Formation day'''\n| 1 November\n|-\n| '''State animal'''\n| [[Chinkara]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\">{{cite web|title=States and Union Territories Symbols|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112080035/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Camel]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Now the state animal camel|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Patrika Group|date=1 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141624/http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|archivedate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''State bird'''\n| [[Great Indian bustard|Godavan (great Indian bustard)]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State flower'''\n| Flower \u2013 [[Tecomella undulata|Rohida]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State Tree'''\n| [[Prosopis cineraria|Khejri]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|}\n[[File:Sonchiriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[great Indian bustard]] has been classed as [[critically endangered]] since 2011.]]\nThough a large percentage of the total area is desert with little forest cover, Rajasthan has a rich and varied flora and fauna.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur.\n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur.

Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like [[Bikaneri Bhujia]]. Other famous dishes include ''bajre ki roti'' (millet bread) and ''lahsun ki chutney'' (hot garlic paste), ''mawa kachori'' [[Mirchi Bada]], [[Pyaaj Kachori]] and [[ghevar]] from Jodhpur, [[Alwar]] ka Mawa (milk cake), ''Kadhi kachori'' from Ajmer, ''malpauas'' from Pushkar, Daal [[kachori]] (Kota kachori) from Kota and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the [[Marwar]] region of the state is the concept of [[Marwari Bhojnalaya]], or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the [[Marwari people]].\n\n[[Dal baati|Dal-Bati-Churma]] is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the Baati, and then pour pure ghee on top of it. It is served with the daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney. Also served with besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan.\n\nThe [[Ghoomar]] dance from Jaipur, Jodhpur and [[Kalbelia]] of the Kalbelia tribe have gained international recognition. Folk music is a large part of Rajasthani culture. The [[Manganiyar]] and [[Langha (tribe)|Langa]] communities from Rajasthan are notable for their folk music. [[Kathputli (puppetry)|Kathputli]], [[Bhopa]], Chang, Teratali, Ghindr, [[Gair dance]], Kachchhi Ghori, and [[Tejaji]] are examples of traditional Rajasthani culture. Folk songs are commonly ballads which relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or devotional songs known as bhajans and banis which are often accompanied by musical instruments like [[dholak]], [[sitar]], and [[sarangi]] are also sung.\n\nRajasthan is known for its traditional, colourful art. The block prints, tie and dye prints, gota patti (main), Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints, and [[Zari]] embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan. Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts, carpets, and blue pottery are commonly found here. Shopping reflects the colourful culture, Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery. A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top, known as ''[[chaniya choli]]''Mainly pure owned by traditional people . A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours like blue, yellow and orange.\n\nThe main religious festivals are [[Deepawali]], [[Holi]], [[Gangaur]], [[Teej]], [[Gogaji]], [[Devnarayan|Shri Devnarayan Jayanti]], [[Makar Sankranti]] and [[Janmashtami]], as the main religion is [[Hinduism]]. Rajasthan's desert festival is held once a year during winter. Dressed in costumes, the people of the desert dance and sing ballads. There are fairs with snake charmers, puppeteers, acrobats, and folk performers. Camels play a role in this festival.\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|List of institutions of higher education in Rajasthan}}\n[[File:NIIT University.jpg|alt=|thumb|NIIT University in Neemrana, Rajasthan]]\nDuring recent years, Rajasthan has worked on improving education.

Crusades Battles}}\n}}\n\nThe '''First Crusade''' (1096\u20131099) was the first of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first initiative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Muhammad]] founded the Islamic religion in the 7th{{nbsp}}century leading to the [[Early Muslim conquests|conquest]] by Muslim Arabs of territory that ranged from the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the east, across North Africa and Southern France to the Iberian Peninsula in the West. [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were taken from the Byzantine Empire. It was political and religious fragmentation that brought this expansion to an end. [[Shia Islam]]{{mdash}}the belief system that only descendants of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali]], and daughter, [[Fatimah]], could lawfully be [[caliph]]{{mdash}} emerged leading a [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|split]] with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Islam]] on theology, ritual and law. [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]] became independent in modern Spain and Portugal from the 8th{{nbsp}}century. The Shi'ite [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty ruled North Africa, swathes of Western Asia including Jerusalem, Damascus and parts of the Mediterranean coastline from 969.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=19\u201320}}. The Muslims rulers did not require total submission to Islam from Jews or Christians because they were considered [[People of the Book]] or [[dhimmi]]. As such they could continue following their faiths on payment of a [[Jizya|poll tax]]. In the Near East a minority Muslim elite ruled over indigenous Christians{{mdash}}Greeks, [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]] and [[Copts]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=18\u201323}}\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims, such as the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref> The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes. A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}} The breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\nBy the start of the 11th{{nbsp}}century, the influence of the papacy had declined to that of little more than a localised [[bishopric]]. In the period from around 1050 until 1080 it was the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement that developed increasingly assertive policies, eager to increase its power and influence. This prompted conflict with eastern Christians rooted in the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]]. The Eastern church viewed the pope as only one of the [[Pentarchy|five patriarchs]] of the Church, alongside the Patriarchates of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. In 1054 differencies in custom, creed and practice spurred [[Pope Leo IX]] to send a legation to the Patriarch of Constantinople, which ended in mutual [[excommunication]] and an [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=24\u201330}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al_Andalus_&_Christian_Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[wikt:Catalans|Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|la|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Byzantine Empire and locations of key battles with the Seljuks for the control of [[Anatolia]] in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted and locations of key battles in the 1070s indicated]]Compared with Western Europe the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world were historic centres of wealth, culture and military power. As such, the west was viewed as a backwater that presented negligable threat.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}} Under [[Basil II]] the territorial recovery of the Empire reached its furthest extent in 1025. The Empire's frontiers stretched east to Iran, Bulgaria was under control as was much of southern Italy and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea had been suppressed. Relations with the Empire's Islamic neighbours were no more quarrelsome than relations with the [[Slavs]] or Western Christians. [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in Italy; [[Pechenegs]], [[Serbs]] and [[Cumans]] to the north; and Seljuk Turks in the east were all in competition with the Empire and to meet these challenges the emperors recruited [[mercenary|mercenaries]], even on occasions from their enemies.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nThe first waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East enjoined Arab and Turkic history from the 9th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=6\u20137}} The status quo in Western Asia was challenged by later waves of Turkish migration, particularly the arrival of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks in the 10th{{nbsp}}century. These were a minor ruling clan from Transoxania. They converted to Islam and migrated into Iran to seek their fortune. In the following two decades they conquered Iran, Iraq and the Near East. The Seljuks and their followers were [[Sunni|Sunni Msulims]] which led to conflict in Palestine and Syria with the Shi'ite Fatimids.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=39\u201341}} The Seljuks nomads, Turkish speaking and occasionally shamanistic. Behaviours that were very different from those of their sedentary, Arabic speaking subjects. This was a difference that weakened power structures when combined with the Seljuks habitual governance of territory based on political preferment and competition between independent princes rather than geography.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=43\u201344}} Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] attempted to suppress the Seljuks sporadic raiding in 1071 but was defeated at the [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]. Historians once considered this a pivotal event, but the battle is now considered as only one further step in the expansion of the [[Great Seljuk Empire]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, it has been argued that Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=8}}.</ref> According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of ''[[Deus vult]]!''

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:PeoplesCrusadeMassacre.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An illustration showing the defeat of the [[People's Crusade]], from S\u00e9bastien Mamerot's ''Livre des Passages d'Outre-mer'' ([[Jean Colombe]], c. 1472\u201375, [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|BNF]] Fr. 5594)|alt=Lines of peasants and armies are shown in battle against the Seljuq Turks.]]Lacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\n\n[[File:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|300px|Route of the First Crusade through Asia]]Urban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dying of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and February that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, northern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the siege was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few causalities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march restarted, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\n===Continued march to Jerusalem===\n\n{{main|First Crusade: March down the Mediterranean coast}}\n\nProceeding down the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned [[siege of Arqa]].<ref name=\"Tyerman150\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=150}}.</ref>[[Iftikhar ad-Daula]], the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the arrival of the Crusaders.

Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=153\u2013157}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Jerusalem===\n{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]Crusaders' arrival at Jerusalem revealed an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriarch meant there was no obvious ecclesiastical candidate to establish an religious lordship, as a body of opinion maintained. Although Raymond of Toulouse could claim to be the  pre-eminent crusade leader from 1098 his support had waned since his failed attempts to besiege [[Arqa]] and create his own realm. This may have been why he piously refused the crown on the grounds that it could only be worn by Christ. It may also have been an attempt to persuade others to reject the title, however Godfrey was already familiar with such a position and more persuasive was probably the large army of troops from Lorraine in Jerusalem, led by him and his brothers, [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]], who were vassals of the [[House of Ardenne-Verdun|Ardennes-Bouillion dynasty]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=62}} Therefore Godfrey was elected, accepting the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Ascalon===\n{{Main|Battle of Ascalon}}\n\nIn August [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] landed a force of 20,000 North Africans at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabbling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe majority of crusaders now considered their pilgrimage complete and returned home. Only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry remained to defend [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was the support of the knights from Lorraine that enabled Godfrey to take secular leadership of Jerusalem, over the claims of Raymond. When he dies a year later these same Lorrainers thwarted the [[papal legate]], [[Dagobert of Pisa]]'s plans for Jerusalem becoming a [[theocracy]] and instead made Baldwin the first Latin [[List of kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=116}} Bohemond returned to Europe to fight the Byzantines from Italy but he was defeated in 1108 at [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|Dyrrhachium]]. After Raymond's death, his heirs captured [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with the Genoese support. {{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}} Relations between the newly created Crusader states of the county of Edessa and the principality of Antioch were variable: they fought together in the crusader defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]]; but the Antiocheans claimed suzerainty and blocked the return of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] after his capture at the battle.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=70}} The Franks became fully engaged in Near East politics with the result that Muslims and Christians often fought on opposing sides. The expansion of Antioch's territorial expansion ended in 1119 with the major defeat to the Turks at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|200px|thumb|left|A map of western Anatolia showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101|alt=A map of western Anatolia, showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101]] However, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Back at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'') thanks to his exploits.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> Among the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nThere is limited written evidence of the Islamic reaction dating fromm before 1160, but what there is indicates the crusade was barely noticed. This may be the result of a cultural misunderstanding in that the Turks and Arabs did not recognise the crusaders as the religiously motivated warriors they with motivations of conquest and settlement. The assumption was the crusaders were just the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries. Also the Islamic world remained divided between rival rulers in [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]]. There was no pan-Islamic counter-attack giving the crusaders the opportunity to consolidate.\n\n==Historiography==\n\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n\nLatin Christedom was amazed by the success of the First Crusade for which they onlt credible explanation was it was the work of God. If the crusade had failed it is likely that the paradigm of crusading would have become [[Obsolescence|Obsolete]]. Instead this form of religious warfare was popular for centuries and the crusade itself became one of the most written about historic event of the medieval period. One of the most influential and earliest works was the anonymous {{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}} or ''Deeds of the Franks''. It was probably written by an Italo-Norman noble in Jerusalem from 1100. It was a new type of epic and heroic narrative, rather than chronicle, history callen a {{lang|la|historia}}. [[Raymond of Aquilers]], [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and [[Peter Tudebode]] used this as a template for their own versions.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThese sources were in turn rewritten by three Benedictine northern French monks; [[Robert of Rheims]], [[Guibert of Nogent]] and [[Baldric of Bourgueil]]. Not only did they polish the language used, they also added their own events. Robert's additions included Biblical references, miraculous events and expanded the part played by Pope Urban to the point where he instigated, directed and legitimised towards the objective that was always Jerusalem. The popularity of these works shaped how crusading was viewed in the medieval mind and Robert's work was the source of the 10,000 line {{lang|fr|[[chanson de geste]]}}, epic poem, about the crusade called {{lang|fr|[[Chanson d'Antioche]]}}. The crusades in memory were shaped by these works; with Godfrey as the primary leader, the miracles of the [[Holy Lance]] and revelling in the violent sack of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nHistorians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref> [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}</ref> [[Thomas F. Madden]] argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref> [[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref> In the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref> [[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan further argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. |isbn=978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-36931-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first initiative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Muhammad]] founded the Islamic religion in the 7th{{nbsp}}century leading to the [[Early Muslim conquests|conquest]] by Muslim Arabs of territory that ranged from the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the east, across North Africa and Southern France to the Iberian Peninsula in the West. [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were taken from the Byzantine Empire. It was political and religious fragmentation that brought this expansion to an end. [[Shia Islam]]{{mdash}}the belief system that only descendants of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali]], and daughter, [[Fatimah]], could lawfully be [[caliph]]{{mdash}} emerged leading a [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|split]] with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Islam]] on theology, ritual and law. [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]] became independent in modern Spain and Portugal from the 8th{{nbsp}}century. The Shi'ite [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty ruled North Africa, swathes of Western Asia including Jerusalem, Damascus and parts of the Mediterranean coastline from 969.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=19\u201320}}. The Muslims rulers did not require total submission to Islam from Jews or Christians because they were considered [[People of the Book]] or [[dhimmi]]. As such they could continue following their faiths on payment of a [[Jizya|poll tax]]. In the Near East a minority Muslim elite ruled over indigenous Christians{{mdash}}Greeks, [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]] and [[Copts]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=18\u201323}}\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims, such as the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref> The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes. A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}} The breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\nBy the start of the 11th{{nbsp}}century, the influence of the papacy had declined to that of little more than a localised [[bishopric]]. In the period from around 1050 until 1080 it was the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement that developed increasingly assertive policies, eager to increase its power and influence. This prompted conflict with eastern Christians rooted in the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]]. The Eastern church viewed the pope as only one of the [[Pentarchy|five patriarchs]] of the Church, alongside the Patriarchates of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. In 1054 differencies in custom, creed and practice spurred [[Pope Leo IX]] to send a legation to the Patriarch of Constantinople, which ended in mutual [[excommunication]] and an [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=24\u201330}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al_Andalus_&_Christian_Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[wikt:Catalans|Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|la|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Byzantine Empire and locations of key battles with the Seljuks for the control of [[Anatolia]] in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted and locations of key battles in the 1070s indicated]]Compared with Western Europe the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world were historic centres of wealth, culture and military power. As such, the west was viewed as a backwater that presented negligable threat.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}} Under [[Basil II]] the territorial recovery of the Empire reached its furthest extent in 1025. The Empire's frontiers stretched east to Iran, Bulgaria was under control as was much of southern Italy and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea had been suppressed. Relations with the Empire's Islamic neighbours were no more quarrelsome than relations with the [[Slavs]] or Western Christians. [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in Italy; [[Pechenegs]], [[Serbs]] and [[Cumans]] to the north; and Seljuk Turks in the east were all in competition with the Empire and to meet these challenges the emperors recruited [[mercenary|mercenaries]], even on occasions from their enemies.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nThe first waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East enjoined Arab and Turkic history from the 9th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=6\u20137}} The status quo in Western Asia was challenged by later waves of Turkish migration, particularly the arrival of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks in the 10th{{nbsp}}century. These were a minor ruling clan from Transoxania. They converted to Islam and migrated into Iran to seek their fortune. In the following two decades they conquered Iran, Iraq and the Near East. The Seljuks and their followers were [[Sunni|Sunni Msulims]] which led to conflict in Palestine and Syria with the Shi'ite Fatimids.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=39\u201341}} The Seljuks nomads, Turkish speaking and occasionally shamanistic. Behaviours that were very different from those of their sedentary, Arabic speaking subjects. This was a difference that weakened power structures when combined with the Seljuks habitual governance of territory based on political preferment and competition between independent princes rather than geography.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=43\u201344}} Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] attempted to suppress the Seljuks sporadic raiding in 1071 but was defeated at the [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]. Historians once considered this a pivotal event, but the battle is now considered as only one further step in the expansion of the [[Great Seljuk Empire]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}} Malik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal.

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]].

At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\n\n[[File:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|300px|Route of the First Crusade through Asia]]Urban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dying of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and February that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, northern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the siege was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few causalities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march restarted, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\n===Continued march to Jerusalem===\n\n{{main|First Crusade: March down the Mediterranean coast}}\n\nProceeding down the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned [[siege of Arqa]].<ref name=\"Tyerman150\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=150}}.</ref>[[Iftikhar ad-Daula]], the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the arrival of the Crusaders.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriarch meant there was no obvious ecclesiastical candidate to establish an religious lordship, as a body of opinion maintained. Although Raymond of Toulouse could claim to be the  pre-eminent crusade leader from 1098 his support had waned since his failed attempts to besiege [[Arqa]] and create his own realm. This may have been why he piously refused the crown on the grounds that it could only be worn by Christ. It may also have been an attempt to persuade others to reject the title, however Godfrey was already familiar with such a position and more persuasive was probably the large army of troops from Lorraine in Jerusalem, led by him and his brothers, [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]], who were vassals of the [[House of Ardenne-Verdun|Ardennes-Bouillion dynasty]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=62}} Therefore Godfrey was elected, accepting the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Ascalon===\n{{Main|Battle of Ascalon}}\n\nIn August [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] landed a force of 20,000 North Africans at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabbling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe majority of crusaders now considered their pilgrimage complete and returned home. Only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry remained to defend [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was the support of the knights from Lorraine that enabled Godfrey to take secular leadership of Jerusalem, over the claims of Raymond. When he dies a year later these same Lorrainers thwarted the [[papal legate]], [[Dagobert of Pisa]]'s plans for Jerusalem becoming a [[theocracy]] and instead made Baldwin the first Latin [[List of kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=116}} Bohemond returned to Europe to fight the Byzantines from Italy but he was defeated in 1108 at [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|Dyrrhachium]]. After Raymond's death, his heirs captured [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with the Genoese support. {{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}} Relations between the newly created Crusader states of the county of Edessa and the principality of Antioch were variable: they fought together in the crusader defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]]; but the Antiocheans claimed suzerainty and blocked the return of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] after his capture at the battle.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=70}} The Franks became fully engaged in Near East politics with the result that Muslims and Christians often fought on opposing sides. The expansion of Antioch's territorial expansion ended in 1119 with the major defeat to the Turks at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|200px|thumb|left|A map of western Anatolia showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101|alt=A map of western Anatolia, showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101]] However, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Back at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'') thanks to his exploits.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> Among the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nThere is limited written evidence of the Islamic reaction dating fromm before 1160, but what there is indicates the crusade was barely noticed. This may be the result of a cultural misunderstanding in that the Turks and Arabs did not recognise the crusaders as the religiously motivated warriors they with motivations of conquest and settlement. The assumption was the crusaders were just the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries. Also the Islamic world remained divided between rival rulers in [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]]. There was no pan-Islamic counter-attack giving the crusaders the opportunity to consolidate.\n\n==Historiography==\n\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n\nLatin Christedom was amazed by the success of the First Crusade for which they onlt credible explanation was it was the work of God. If the crusade had failed it is likely that the paradigm of crusading would have become [[Obsolescence|Obsolete]]. Instead this form of religious warfare was popular for centuries and the crusade itself became one of the most written about historic event of the medieval period. One of the most influential and earliest works was the anonymous {{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}} or ''Deeds of the Franks''. It was probably written by an Italo-Norman noble in Jerusalem from 1100. It was a new type of epic and heroic narrative, rather than chronicle, history callen a {{lang|la|historia}}. [[Raymond of Aquilers]], [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and [[Peter Tudebode]] used this as a template for their own versions.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThese sources were in turn rewritten by three Benedictine northern French monks; [[Robert of Rheims]], [[Guibert of Nogent]] and [[Baldric of Bourgueil]]. Not only did they polish the language used, they also added their own events. Robert's additions included Biblical references, miraculous events and expanded the part played by Pope Urban to the point where he instigated, directed and legitimised towards the objective that was always Jerusalem. The popularity of these works shaped how crusading was viewed in the medieval mind and Robert's work was the source of the 10,000 line {{lang|fr|[[chanson de geste]]}}, epic poem, about the crusade called {{lang|fr|[[Chanson d'Antioche]]}}. The crusades in memory were shaped by these works; with Godfrey as the primary leader, the miracles of the [[Holy Lance]] and revelling in the violent sack of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nHistorians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref> [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}</ref> [[Thomas F. Madden]] argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref> [[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref> In the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref> [[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan further argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. |isbn=978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-36931-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

In use from 21 October 1901 to 31 May 1938, the private railway connected the area of [[Hof, Vestfold|Hof]] to T\u00f8nsberg, the coast and the [[Vestfold Line]] of the [[Norwegian State Railways]]. The main purpose of the {{convert|48.10|km|adj=on}} [[narrow gauge railway]] was to connect [[Eidsfos Verk]] to the mainline, although the railway also operated passenger trains. The line shares {{convert|6|km}} with the [[Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line]] (HVB), the two which from 1934 were operated by the same company, [[Vestfold Privatbaner]].\n\n==Route==\nThe T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line was {{convert|48.10|km|sp=us}} long and ran from T\u00f8nsberg to Eidsfoss, entirely in the county of Vestfold. The line was [[narrow gauge]] {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} and not electrified.<ref name=b226>Bjerke (1994): 226</ref> The line ran through flat and easy terrain, with no tunnels or cuttings, and only three bridges. The steepest gradient was 16\u2154 per mil, the smallest curve radius was {{convert|150|m|sp=us}}. At T\u00f8nsberg the line interchanged with the Vestfold Line, and along the {{convert|6|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section from Hillestad to Hof the line shared track with the Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line. TEB had eighteen station. AT Eikfoss it corresponded with steamship services on the lake [[Eikeren]].<ref name=a146>Aspenberg (1994): 146</ref>\n\nIn the original track configuration in T\u00f8nsberg, the line started at the post at Stensarmen, which was located {{convert|1.50|km|abbr=on}} from T\u00f8nsberg Station. The continued to Jarlsberg Points ({{convert|3.24|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), where there was an intersection with the Vestfold Line. From 1915 the track arrangements in T\u00f8nsberg were altered and the Vestfold Line was placed in a loop through the town. The last part of the section to Stemsarmen became a spur of this loop, with TEB sharing track with the Vestfold Line for the return part of the loop. The new [[T\u00f8nsberg Station]], shared with the [[Norwegian State Railways (1883\u20131996)|Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB), was located {{convert|1.50|km|abbr=on}} from Stensarmen, but at a different location than the old station.<ref name=b228>Bjerke (1994): 228</ref>\n\nThe first station after Jarlsberg Points was [[Auli Station (T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line)|Auli]] ({{convert|6.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} from Stensarmen), which had the line's lowest elevation north of T\u00f8nsberg of {{convert|8.4|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL). The line continued past [[Fresti Station]] ({{convert|9.70|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and immediately afterwards crossed the {{convert|20|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Fresti Bridge. The line continued past [[Klopp Station]] ({{convert|12.20|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) [[Ramnes Station]] ({{convert|14.50|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) before running across the wooden {{convert|126|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Valle Bridge. It then reached [[Revatal Station]] ({{convert|17.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Fossan Station]] ({{convert|19.14|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) before passed a platform at Bakke ({{convert|20.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). Next the line went past [[Svinevoll Station]] ({{convert|21.95|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) [[Baktsv\u00e5l Station]] ({{convert|24.90|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), [[Barkost Station]] ({{convert|29.30|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and then [[Hildestad Station]] ({{convert|33.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), where it was joined by HVB.<ref name=b228 />\n\nOn the concurrent section the line crossed a creek on the {{convert|20|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Sundbyfoss Bridge and immediately afterwards reached [[Sundbyfoss Station]]({{convert|36.75|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). The concurrency ended at [[Hof Station]] ({{convert|39.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), which was the highest station at {{convert|68.2|m|sp=us}} AMSL. TEB continued down to [[Kopstad Station]] ({{convert|42.20|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), past a spur to Hoff Sag & H\u00f8vleri, past [[Stubben Station]] ({{convert|45.40|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) to [[Eidsfoss Station]] ({{convert|48.10|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}).<ref name=b228 />\n\nNorth of Hillestad, most the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] has been retained, some of it as forestry roads, while other parts have grown wild. From Hof to Eidsfoss, the route can be driven by car. The station building in Eidsfoss was demolished in the 1960s, but the stone depot remains. South of Hillestad, large parts of the line went over agricultural land, and these portions have been reclaimed as such.<ref name=a148>Aspenberg (1994): 148</ref> The engine shed at Eidsfoss Station is preserved and has been listed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage|Directorate for Cultural Heritage]].<ref>Hartmann (1997): 217</ref> The section of the T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line between T\u00f8nsberg Station and Stensarmen remained used as a spur to the port until 1980.<ref name=a150 />\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nProposals for a Vestfold Line arose in the late 1860s and accelerated through the 1870s.<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 12</ref> The county was split in where the line should run, with three major proposals: along the shore of the [[Oslofjord]], along [[Eikeren]] to Eidsfoss and through an inland route to T\u00f8nsberg, and via [[L\u00e5gendalen]] to [[Larvik]].<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 13</ref> The Eidsfoss alternative allowed the line to run through an area with good access to lumber, which the railway would aid export. The main disadvantage was that the route was {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} longer than via the coast.<ref>Broch (1936): 98</ref> The issue was not resolved until [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 8 June 1875 voted in favor of a coastal route. The narrow gauge Vestfold Line, at the time named the Jarlsberg Line, opened in 1881.<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 16</ref>\n\nAmong the strongest interests in building an interior railway through Vestfold was Schwartz, owner of [[Eidsfoss Verk]]. The iron works needed supplies of coal and ore and a means of shipping the iron. The roads in the area were in poor condition and in the winter horse-drawn sleds were used. Official proposals for a private railway to connect Eidsfoss to the coast were launched in 1893. The idea caught on in T\u00f8nsberg, where the business community saw the possibility of getting an edge on the competing towns of Holmestrand and Horten through a railway to the interior.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 90</ref> Among the stoutest proponents with Lars Christensen and took initiative to establish a committee. It hired Ole Lund to conduct surveys of a potential line. He concluded that a railway would cost 1.3 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK),<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 91</ref> and provide an operating profit of NOK&nbsp;26,210 per year.<ref name=j92>Jakobsen (1993): 92</ref>\n\nIn a common meeting between the municipal council and the chamber of commerce in Tr\u00f8nsberg on 16 April 1894, there was large support for a railway to Eidsfoss. They decided to build the railway as cheaply and simply as possible.<ref name=j92 /> The municipal council obliged itself to purchase shares worth NOK&nbsp;400,000 and the sales of the remaining shares started immediately. For municipalities through which the line would run, there was varying degree of support, with for instance [[Ramnes]] and [[Fon, Norway|Fon]] demanding that the line serve additional hamlets. This caused delays, as the committee had to negotiate with various local interests which were trying to purchase diversions and spurs through promises of purchasing additional shares. [[V\u00e5le]] was not willing to buy shares in the railway company, and thus the line was moved in favor of the residents of Ramnes.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 93</ref>\n\nThe railway committee sent an application on 29 February 1896 to the government, which was debated by Parliament's [[Standing Committee on Railways]] on 14 July. It simultaneously considered the application for the construction of the Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line and approved a grant of NOK&nbsp;596,000 to TEB. The issue was debated in the plenary on 24 July and there the grant was approved, with forty parliamentarians voting against it. The [[Cabinet of Norway|Cabinet of State]] officially granted an operating permit on 4 June 1898, which initially had a duration of thirty years.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 94</ref>\n\n===Construction and early years===\nConstruction was subcontracted to S. S\u00f8rensen, who bid NOK&nbsp;1,039,400 for the job. The lower cost would normally have resulted in lower state subsidies, but the money was instead permitted to be used to increase the rail weight from 15 to 17.5&nbsp;kilograms per meter and a wider curve radius. Construction was eased by the flat landscape.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 97</ref> Two steam locomotives, named ''T\u00f8nsberg'' and ''Eidsfoss'', were bought from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] along with six passenger carriages from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]]. Eidsfoss Verk built their own forty-eight cargo cars.<ref name=j99>Jakobsen (1993): 99</ref> ''T\u00f8nsberg'' was delivered in April 1899 and ''Eidsfoss'' in May and both participated in the construction work.<ref name=j140>Jakobsen (1993): 140</ref>\n\nThe line was officially opened by [[J\u00f8rgen L\u00f8vland]] on 18 October 1901,<ref name=j99 /> with regular services commencing on 21 October.<ref name=a146 /> At Eidsfoss the line corresponded with a steamship on Eikern. At first it was served by ''Ekern'' and from 1903 ''Stadthauptmand Schwartz''.<ref name=a146 /> TEB proved popular with tourists as part of a leg of a round trip from Oslo to T\u00f8nsberg.<ref name=j99 /> A third locomotive, ''Bj\u00f8rn'', was bought from HVB in 1904. TEB also took delivery of fifteen additional freight cars.<ref name=j140 />\n\nFor the first couple of years the line's finances were good,<ref name=j99 /> but by 1908 the company was in financial distress and applied to the [[Ministry of Labour (Norway 1885\u20131946)|Ministry of Labor]] to cover NOK&nbsp;200,000 in accumulated debts which were in part caused by smaller reallocation of tracks. Parliament approved NOK&nbsp;108,500 in debt reduction on 16 July 1912, half through the issue of a prioritized loan and half through the purchase of new shares. It also approved a guarantee for an operating deficit of up to NOK&nbsp;7,000 per year, while demanding that any further deficits be covered by the municipalities.<ref name=j100>Jakobsen (1993): 100</ref>\n\nDuring the planning of TEB there was discussion about changing the state railway's line through town and building a new station. This would have allowed NSB trains to avoid having to back from Jarlsberg Points. TEB therefore chose to build their station at Knapl\u00f8kken. Thus T\u00f8nsberg was served by four stations. NSB therefore decided that it would build the Vestfold Line through T\u00f8nsberg in a loop, build a new, common station for TEB and NSB, and align the Vestfold Line out of T\u00f8nsberg next to TEB.<ref name=a148 /> The new line was taken into use on 1 October 1915 and the new station was completed in 1916.<ref name=a150>Aspenberg (1994): 150</ref>\n\n===Financial difficulties===\nPassenger traffic was fairly stable for the first years, at between 55,000 and 65,000 annual passengers. An exception occurred in 1907, when only 43,000 people were transported. Cargo transport rose gradually passing 20,000 tonnes per year in 1903 and 30,000 in 1908. The line experienced a rapid growth during the later part of the [[First World War]], with passenger traffic peaking at 71,000 in 1918 and 35,000 tonnes of cargo.<ref name=a147>Aspenberg (1994): 147</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 the company experienced a rapid rise in labor and fuel costs, without a corresponding rise in revenue. The original plans for the line had overestimated the amount of cargo that would be shipped, largely because any cargo departing for north of Bagstvold was sent via HVB to Holmestrand instead of the longer route via TEB. As NSB had lower freight rates, shippers would often send cargo via HVB even if it was going to T\u00f8nsberg or further south in Vestfold. The only significant source of revenue along the segment were the wide cars from Eidsfoss Verk, which were hindered by the [[loading gauge]] of the tunnel on HVB.<ref name=j102>Jakobsen (1993): 102</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the railway company was struggling financially, starting off with a deficit of NOK&nbsp;144,287 in 1920,<ref name=j100 /> which was largely paid for by T\u00f8nsberg Municipality. The municipality stated that it did not want to act as guarantor anymore, and implied that the state should cover the bill. This caused [[T\u00f8nsberg Sparebank]] to cut the railway company's access to credit. On the other hand, the municipalities of Hoff and Ramnes both stated that they were willing to continue covering the deficits. At a board meeting held on 26 January 1921, all forty-five employees in TEB were laid off from 1 May. The county governor demanded that the state should take over the line.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 101</ref>\n\nThe issue was discussed by NSB's board, and on 10 March the [[Ministry of Labour (Norway 1885\u20131946)|Ministry of Labor]] supported the boards motion to not nationalize the line. The issue was resolved on 28 April, when the ministry agreed to subsidize the first NOK&nbsp;50,000 in deficits and a third of the remainder. The line's debt was [[refinanced]], with NOK&nbsp;73,928.60 being covered by a loan from the state and the remainder being taken over by the municipalities. In the following years the deficits were gradually reduced, hitting a low NOK&nbsp;54,175 in 1924.<ref name=j102 />\n\nPatronage continued to fall, from 45,000 per year in 1921 to 35,000 in 1926.<ref name=a147 /> The steamship service on Eikeren was terminated in 1925, causing a significant decrease in the traffic, a year the line had a record-low passenger and cargo transport. A contributing factor was that alternative modes of transport, such as cars and bicycles became more popular. T\u00f8nsberg Municipality had by 1926 covered an accumulated NOK&nbsp;407,254 in deficits. Further decreases in the freight traffic caused the municipality to establish a committee in 1924 to consider the line's future, and two years later it recommended that the line be closed from 29 June 1927.<ref name=j102 /> This was followed up by the ministry, who also stated that they intended to cut subsidies from the same date.<ref name=j103>Jakobsen (1993): 103</ref>\n\nThe railway company's management opposed a closing, stating that the road did not have capacity to take over the line's annual 50,000 passengers and 50,000 tonnes of cargo. They instead proposed a cost cut of NOK&nbsp;20 to 30,000 per year, in part through a reduced frequency,<ref name=j103 /> and in part through the closing of Klopp Station and the un-staffing of Barkost, Sundbyfoss and Stubben. This was not sufficient for the T\u00f8nsberg Municipal Council, who on 7 April 1927 unanimously voted against an additional year of operation and instead encouraged planning of a road. The issue was discussed again on 20 May and this time a narrow majority supported the closing.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 105</ref>\n\n===Merger and closing===\nOn 23 June the management of TEB and HVB agreed to merge the administration of the two companies, under the leadership of HVB's director Heggenhougen. The agreement would allow further cost cutting, as the administration and workshop in T\u00f8nsberg could be closed. However, the two lines would continue to be owned and operate by separate companies. Minister of Labor [[Darre Jensen]] visited the area in October, and concluded that the roads did not have sufficient standard that the railway could be closed. The railway company bought a gasoline [[multiple unit]], allowing for cheaper passenger train operations.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 107</ref>\n\nAn all-time low patronage of 22,000 struck in 1928, before the numbers started increasing, hitting 33,000 in 1930.<ref name=a147 /> However, the line continued to lose money and its concessions and operating guarantees were renewed on an annual basis. Closing was discussed by NSB in 1931 and again in 1932. The company proposed a reduction in wages, and on 6 October 1933 all employees were laid off. The end result was that TEB and HVB merged to form Vestfold Privatbaner, effective 1 July 1934.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 108</ref>\n\n===Heritage===\nNorsk Privatebane Historisk Selskap was established in 1967 with the intention of establishing a [[heritage railway]]. It first attempted to establish itself at Kopstad Station, but instead settled for Kleppen Station. It was at the time intact with a full inventory, including such items as a complete storage of unused tickets.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 203</ref> Several of the railway carriages were identified, most of them used as cabins. One person offered to donate two carriages, with original interior and coloring, but after a building permit was rejected he instead chose to burn them down. A representative traveled to Sweden, where he was able to purchase narrow-gauge rolling stock.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 204</ref> Clearing of the line at Hillestad started in May 1968 and station building at Kleppen was attempted transported up to Hillestad. However, the truck carrying the building had an accident and the building was smashed. The heritage enthusiasm died out.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 205</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Narrow gauge railways in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{commons category|T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfossbanen}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aspenberg |first=Nils Carl |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=Glemte spor: boken om sidebanenes tragiske liv |year=1994 |publisher=Baneforlaget |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91448-00-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bjerke |first=Thor |title=Banedata '94 |year=1994 |publisher=Norsk Jernbaneklubb |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-90286-15-5}}\n* {{cite book |last=Broch |first=Just |title=Av Norges statsbaners historie: Anleggene gjennom sytti\u00e5renes lys inn i \u00e5tti\u00e5renes m\u00f8rke |volume=2 |year=1936 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |url=http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/a24f368a47b0e3fad157523629d8b34b |language=Norwegian}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Eivind |last2=Mangset |first2=\u00d8istein |last3=Reisegg |first3=\u00d8yvind |title=Neste stasjon |publisher=Gyldendal |year=1997 |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-05-25294-7 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2008081200033}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jakobsen |first=Asbj\u00f8rn N. |title=Sm\u00e5-tog p\u00e5 spinkle skinner gjennem det indre av Vestfold |year=1993 |publisher=A.N.

In use from 21 October 1901 to 31 May 1938, the private railway connected the area of [[Hof, Vestfold|Hof]] to T\u00f8nsberg, the coast and the [[Vestfold Line]] of the [[Norwegian State Railways]]. The main purpose of the {{convert|48.10|km|adj=on}} [[narrow gauge railway]] was to connect [[Eidsfos Verk]] to the mainline, although the railway also operated passenger trains. The line shares {{convert|6|km}} with the [[Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line]] (HVB), the two which from 1934 were operated by the same company, [[Vestfold Privatbaner]].\n\n==Route==\nThe T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line was {{convert|48.10|km|sp=us}} long and ran from T\u00f8nsberg to Eidsfoss, entirely in the county of Vestfold. The line was [[narrow gauge]] {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} and not electrified.<ref name=b226>Bjerke (1994): 226</ref> The line ran through flat and easy terrain, with no tunnels or cuttings, and only three bridges. The steepest gradient was 16\u2154 per mil, the smallest curve radius was {{convert|150|m|sp=us}}. At T\u00f8nsberg the line interchanged with the Vestfold Line, and along the {{convert|6|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section from Hillestad to Hof the line shared track with the Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line. TEB had eighteen station. AT Eikfoss it corresponded with steamship services on the lake [[Eikeren]].<ref name=a146>Aspenberg (1994): 146</ref>\n\nIn the original track configuration in T\u00f8nsberg, the line started at the post at Stensarmen, which was located {{convert|1.50|km|abbr=on}} from T\u00f8nsberg Station. The continued to Jarlsberg Points ({{convert|3.24|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), where there was an intersection with the Vestfold Line. From 1915 the track arrangements in T\u00f8nsberg were altered and the Vestfold Line was placed in a loop through the town. The last part of the section to Stemsarmen became a spur of this loop, with TEB sharing track with the Vestfold Line for the return part of the loop. The new [[T\u00f8nsberg Station]], shared with the [[Norwegian State Railways (1883\u20131996)|Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB), was located {{convert|1.50|km|abbr=on}} from Stensarmen, but at a different location than the old station.<ref name=b228>Bjerke (1994): 228</ref>\n\nThe first station after Jarlsberg Points was [[Auli Station (T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line)|Auli]] ({{convert|6.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} from Stensarmen), which had the line's lowest elevation north of T\u00f8nsberg of {{convert|8.4|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL). The line continued past [[Fresti Station]] ({{convert|9.70|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and immediately afterwards crossed the {{convert|20|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Fresti Bridge. The line continued past [[Klopp Station]] ({{convert|12.20|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) [[Ramnes Station]] ({{convert|14.50|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) before running across the wooden {{convert|126|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Valle Bridge. It then reached [[Revatal Station]] ({{convert|17.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Fossan Station]] ({{convert|19.14|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) before passed a platform at Bakke ({{convert|20.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). Next the line went past [[Svinevoll Station]] ({{convert|21.95|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) [[Baktsv\u00e5l Station]] ({{convert|24.90|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), [[Barkost Station]] ({{convert|29.30|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and then [[Hildestad Station]] ({{convert|33.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), where it was joined by HVB.<ref name=b228 />\n\nOn the concurrent section the line crossed a creek on the {{convert|20|m|sp=us|adj=on}} Sundbyfoss Bridge and immediately afterwards reached [[Sundbyfoss Station]]({{convert|36.75|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). The concurrency ended at [[Hof Station]] ({{convert|39.00|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), which was the highest station at {{convert|68.2|m|sp=us}} AMSL. TEB continued down to [[Kopstad Station]] ({{convert|42.20|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), past a spur to Hoff Sag & H\u00f8vleri, past [[Stubben Station]] ({{convert|45.40|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) to [[Eidsfoss Station]] ({{convert|48.10|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}).<ref name=b228 />\n\nNorth of Hillestad, most the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] has been retained, some of it as forestry roads, while other parts have grown wild. From Hof to Eidsfoss, the route can be driven by car. The station building in Eidsfoss was demolished in the 1960s, but the stone depot remains. South of Hillestad, large parts of the line went over agricultural land, and these portions have been reclaimed as such.<ref name=a148>Aspenberg (1994): 148</ref> The engine shed at Eidsfoss Station is preserved and has been listed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage|Directorate for Cultural Heritage]].<ref>Hartmann (1997): 217</ref> The section of the T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss Line between T\u00f8nsberg Station and Stensarmen remained used as a spur to the port until 1980.<ref name=a150 />\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nProposals for a Vestfold Line arose in the late 1860s and accelerated through the 1870s.<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 12</ref> The county was split in where the line should run, with three major proposals: along the shore of the [[Oslofjord]], along [[Eikeren]] to Eidsfoss and through an inland route to T\u00f8nsberg, and via [[L\u00e5gendalen]] to [[Larvik]].<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 13</ref> The Eidsfoss alternative allowed the line to run through an area with good access to lumber, which the railway would aid export. The main disadvantage was that the route was {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} longer than via the coast.<ref>Broch (1936): 98</ref> The issue was not resolved until [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 8 June 1875 voted in favor of a coastal route. The narrow gauge Vestfold Line, at the time named the Jarlsberg Line, opened in 1881.<ref>Jakobsen (1996): 16</ref>\n\nAmong the strongest interests in building an interior railway through Vestfold was Schwartz, owner of [[Eidsfoss Verk]]. The iron works needed supplies of coal and ore and a means of shipping the iron. The roads in the area were in poor condition and in the winter horse-drawn sleds were used. Official proposals for a private railway to connect Eidsfoss to the coast were launched in 1893. The idea caught on in T\u00f8nsberg, where the business community saw the possibility of getting an edge on the competing towns of Holmestrand and Horten through a railway to the interior.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 90</ref> Among the stoutest proponents with Lars Christensen and took initiative to establish a committee. It hired Ole Lund to conduct surveys of a potential line. He concluded that a railway would cost 1.3 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK),<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 91</ref> and provide an operating profit of NOK&nbsp;26,210 per year.<ref name=j92>Jakobsen (1993): 92</ref>\n\nIn a common meeting between the municipal council and the chamber of commerce in Tr\u00f8nsberg on 16 April 1894, there was large support for a railway to Eidsfoss. They decided to build the railway as cheaply and simply as possible.<ref name=j92 /> The municipal council obliged itself to purchase shares worth NOK&nbsp;400,000 and the sales of the remaining shares started immediately. For municipalities through which the line would run, there was varying degree of support, with for instance [[Ramnes]] and [[Fon, Norway|Fon]] demanding that the line serve additional hamlets. This caused delays, as the committee had to negotiate with various local interests which were trying to purchase diversions and spurs through promises of purchasing additional shares. [[V\u00e5le]] was not willing to buy shares in the railway company, and thus the line was moved in favor of the residents of Ramnes.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 93</ref>\n\nThe railway committee sent an application on 29 February 1896 to the government, which was debated by Parliament's [[Standing Committee on Railways]] on 14 July. It simultaneously considered the application for the construction of the Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss Line and approved a grant of NOK&nbsp;596,000 to TEB. The issue was debated in the plenary on 24 July and there the grant was approved, with forty parliamentarians voting against it. The [[Cabinet of Norway|Cabinet of State]] officially granted an operating permit on 4 June 1898, which initially had a duration of thirty years.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 94</ref>\n\n===Construction and early years===\nConstruction was subcontracted to S. S\u00f8rensen, who bid NOK&nbsp;1,039,400 for the job. The lower cost would normally have resulted in lower state subsidies, but the money was instead permitted to be used to increase the rail weight from 15 to 17.5&nbsp;kilograms per meter and a wider curve radius. Construction was eased by the flat landscape.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 97</ref> Two steam locomotives, named ''T\u00f8nsberg'' and ''Eidsfoss'', were bought from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] along with six passenger carriages from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]]. Eidsfoss Verk built their own forty-eight cargo cars.<ref name=j99>Jakobsen (1993): 99</ref> ''T\u00f8nsberg'' was delivered in April 1899 and ''Eidsfoss'' in May and both participated in the construction work.<ref name=j140>Jakobsen (1993): 140</ref>\n\nThe line was officially opened by [[J\u00f8rgen L\u00f8vland]] on 18 October 1901,<ref name=j99 /> with regular services commencing on 21 October.<ref name=a146 /> At Eidsfoss the line corresponded with a steamship on Eikern. At first it was served by ''Ekern'' and from 1903 ''Stadthauptmand Schwartz''.<ref name=a146 /> TEB proved popular with tourists as part of a leg of a round trip from Oslo to T\u00f8nsberg.<ref name=j99 /> A third locomotive, ''Bj\u00f8rn'', was bought from HVB in 1904. TEB also took delivery of fifteen additional freight cars.<ref name=j140 />\n\nFor the first couple of years the line's finances were good,<ref name=j99 /> but by 1908 the company was in financial distress and applied to the [[Ministry of Labour (Norway 1885\u20131946)|Ministry of Labor]] to cover NOK&nbsp;200,000 in accumulated debts which were in part caused by smaller reallocation of tracks. Parliament approved NOK&nbsp;108,500 in debt reduction on 16 July 1912, half through the issue of a prioritized loan and half through the purchase of new shares. It also approved a guarantee for an operating deficit of up to NOK&nbsp;7,000 per year, while demanding that any further deficits be covered by the municipalities.<ref name=j100>Jakobsen (1993): 100</ref>\n\nDuring the planning of TEB there was discussion about changing the state railway's line through town and building a new station. This would have allowed NSB trains to avoid having to back from Jarlsberg Points. TEB therefore chose to build their station at Knapl\u00f8kken. Thus T\u00f8nsberg was served by four stations. NSB therefore decided that it would build the Vestfold Line through T\u00f8nsberg in a loop, build a new, common station for TEB and NSB, and align the Vestfold Line out of T\u00f8nsberg next to TEB.<ref name=a148 /> The new line was taken into use on 1 October 1915 and the new station was completed in 1916.<ref name=a150>Aspenberg (1994): 150</ref>\n\n===Financial difficulties===\nPassenger traffic was fairly stable for the first years, at between 55,000 and 65,000 annual passengers. An exception occurred in 1907, when only 43,000 people were transported. Cargo transport rose gradually passing 20,000 tonnes per year in 1903 and 30,000 in 1908. The line experienced a rapid growth during the later part of the [[First World War]], with passenger traffic peaking at 71,000 in 1918 and 35,000 tonnes of cargo.<ref name=a147>Aspenberg (1994): 147</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 the company experienced a rapid rise in labor and fuel costs, without a corresponding rise in revenue. The original plans for the line had overestimated the amount of cargo that would be shipped, largely because any cargo departing for north of Bagstvold was sent via HVB to Holmestrand instead of the longer route via TEB. As NSB had lower freight rates, shippers would often send cargo via HVB even if it was going to T\u00f8nsberg or further south in Vestfold. The only significant source of revenue along the segment were the wide cars from Eidsfoss Verk, which were hindered by the [[loading gauge]] of the tunnel on HVB.<ref name=j102>Jakobsen (1993): 102</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the railway company was struggling financially, starting off with a deficit of NOK&nbsp;144,287 in 1920,<ref name=j100 /> which was largely paid for by T\u00f8nsberg Municipality. The municipality stated that it did not want to act as guarantor anymore, and implied that the state should cover the bill. This caused [[T\u00f8nsberg Sparebank]] to cut the railway company's access to credit. On the other hand, the municipalities of Hoff and Ramnes both stated that they were willing to continue covering the deficits. At a board meeting held on 26 January 1921, all forty-five employees in TEB were laid off from 1 May. The county governor demanded that the state should take over the line.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 101</ref>\n\nThe issue was discussed by NSB's board, and on 10 March the [[Ministry of Labour (Norway 1885\u20131946)|Ministry of Labor]] supported the boards motion to not nationalize the line. The issue was resolved on 28 April, when the ministry agreed to subsidize the first NOK&nbsp;50,000 in deficits and a third of the remainder. The line's debt was [[refinanced]], with NOK&nbsp;73,928.60 being covered by a loan from the state and the remainder being taken over by the municipalities. In the following years the deficits were gradually reduced, hitting a low NOK&nbsp;54,175 in 1924.<ref name=j102 />\n\nPatronage continued to fall, from 45,000 per year in 1921 to 35,000 in 1926.<ref name=a147 /> The steamship service on Eikeren was terminated in 1925, causing a significant decrease in the traffic, a year the line had a record-low passenger and cargo transport. A contributing factor was that alternative modes of transport, such as cars and bicycles became more popular. T\u00f8nsberg Municipality had by 1926 covered an accumulated NOK&nbsp;407,254 in deficits. Further decreases in the freight traffic caused the municipality to establish a committee in 1924 to consider the line's future, and two years later it recommended that the line be closed from 29 June 1927.<ref name=j102 /> This was followed up by the ministry, who also stated that they intended to cut subsidies from the same date.<ref name=j103>Jakobsen (1993): 103</ref>\n\nThe railway company's management opposed a closing, stating that the road did not have capacity to take over the line's annual 50,000 passengers and 50,000 tonnes of cargo. They instead proposed a cost cut of NOK&nbsp;20 to 30,000 per year, in part through a reduced frequency,<ref name=j103 /> and in part through the closing of Klopp Station and the un-staffing of Barkost, Sundbyfoss and Stubben. This was not sufficient for the T\u00f8nsberg Municipal Council, who on 7 April 1927 unanimously voted against an additional year of operation and instead encouraged planning of a road. The issue was discussed again on 20 May and this time a narrow majority supported the closing.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 105</ref>\n\n===Merger and closing===\nOn 23 June the management of TEB and HVB agreed to merge the administration of the two companies, under the leadership of HVB's director Heggenhougen. The agreement would allow further cost cutting, as the administration and workshop in T\u00f8nsberg could be closed. However, the two lines would continue to be owned and operate by separate companies. Minister of Labor [[Darre Jensen]] visited the area in October, and concluded that the roads did not have sufficient standard that the railway could be closed. The railway company bought a gasoline [[multiple unit]], allowing for cheaper passenger train operations.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 107</ref>\n\nAn all-time low patronage of 22,000 struck in 1928, before the numbers started increasing, hitting 33,000 in 1930.<ref name=a147 /> However, the line continued to lose money and its concessions and operating guarantees were renewed on an annual basis. Closing was discussed by NSB in 1931 and again in 1932. The company proposed a reduction in wages, and on 6 October 1933 all employees were laid off. The end result was that TEB and HVB merged to form Vestfold Privatbaner, effective 1 July 1934.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 108</ref>\n\n===Heritage===\nNorsk Privatebane Historisk Selskap was established in 1967 with the intention of establishing a [[heritage railway]]. It first attempted to establish itself at Kopstad Station, but instead settled for Kleppen Station. It was at the time intact with a full inventory, including such items as a complete storage of unused tickets.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 203</ref> Several of the railway carriages were identified, most of them used as cabins. One person offered to donate two carriages, with original interior and coloring, but after a building permit was rejected he instead chose to burn them down. A representative traveled to Sweden, where he was able to purchase narrow-gauge rolling stock.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 204</ref> Clearing of the line at Hillestad started in May 1968 and station building at Kleppen was attempted transported up to Hillestad. However, the truck carrying the building had an accident and the building was smashed. The heritage enthusiasm died out.<ref>Jakobsen (1993): 205</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Narrow gauge railways in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{commons category|T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfossbanen}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aspenberg |first=Nils Carl |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=Glemte spor: boken om sidebanenes tragiske liv |year=1994 |publisher=Baneforlaget |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91448-00-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bjerke |first=Thor |title=Banedata '94 |year=1994 |publisher=Norsk Jernbaneklubb |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-90286-15-5}}\n* {{cite book |last=Broch |first=Just |title=Av Norges statsbaners historie: Anleggene gjennom sytti\u00e5renes lys inn i \u00e5tti\u00e5renes m\u00f8rke |volume=2 |year=1936 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |url=http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/a24f368a47b0e3fad157523629d8b34b |language=Norwegian}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Eivind |last2=Mangset |first2=\u00d8istein |last3=Reisegg |first3=\u00d8yvind |title=Neste stasjon |publisher=Gyldendal |year=1997 |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-05-25294-7 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2008081200033}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jakobsen |first=Asbj\u00f8rn N. |title=Sm\u00e5-tog p\u00e5 spinkle skinner gjennem det indre av Vestfold |year=1993 |publisher=A.N.

The sandwich is named after Chilean president [[Ram\u00f3n Barros Luco]], and was coined in the restaurant of the [[National Congress of Chile]], where president Luco always asked for this sandwich.\n* [[Bartlett pear]] \u2013  The English [[Williams pear]] variety was inadvertently renamed by Massachusetts nurseryman [[Enoch Bartlett]], early 19th century.  Williams was a 17th-century English horticulturist.\n* [[Bauru (sandwich)|Bauru]] - This popular Brazilian sandwich was created by college student Casimiro Pinto Neto, nicknamed \"Bauru.\"\n* [[Battenberg cake]] \u2013 probably named after one of the late-19th-century princely [[Battenberg family]] living in England, who gave up their German titles during World War I and changed their name to [[Mountbatten]].\n* [[B\u00e9arnaise sauce]] \u2013 although often thought to indicate the region of B\u00e9arn, the sauce name may well originate in the nickname of French king [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1553\u20131610), \"le Grand B\u00e9arnais.\"\n* [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] \u2013 named to flatter the ma\u00eetre d'Hotel to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], [[Louis de B\u00e9chamel]], Marquis de Nointel (1630\u20131703), also a financier and ambassador.\n* [[Bellini (cocktail)]] \u2013 [[Giovanni Bellini]]\n* [[Ham mousseline \u00e0 la Belmont]] \u2013 [[August Belmont]] (1816\u20131890) was born in Prussia and emigrated to the U.S. to work for the New York branch of Rothschild's.

The ma\u00eetre d' ([[Oscar Tschirky|Oscar of the Waldorf]]) took an interest in Benedict's order, and adapted it for the Waldorf menu, substituting English muffins and ham, adding truffles, and naming it after Benedict. The other version: in 1893, [[Charles Ranhofer]], head chef of [[Delmonico's]], created the dish for Mr. and/or Mrs. [[LeGrand Benedict]], New York stockbroker<ref name=\"Fox News 2014\"/> and socialite.\n* Eggs Benedict XVI \u2013 [[Pope Benedict XVI]], born [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Alois Ratzinger]] (1927) now has a Germanic version of the original [[Eggs Benedict]] named after him.

She became something of an overnight success when she debuted in New York in 1870, after growing up and working in Ohio ballet and theater. She had an active career until taste in drama changed in the 1890s and she turned to writing.

[[Henrik Lindstr\u00f6m]] is said to have been born in St. Petersburg, Russia. Swedish food lore has it that the army officer brought the recipe to the Hotel Witt in Kalmar, Sweden, c. 1862. The beets and capers included may indicate Russian origin or influence.\n* [[Lindy candy bar|Lindy]] [[candy bar]] \u2013 [[Charles Lindbergh]] (1902\u20131974), the pioneering aviator who was first to fly solo, non-stop, across the Atlantic, had at least two American candy bars named after him; another \u2013 the \"Winning Lindy.\"\n* [[Cream of cardoon soup \u00e0 la Livingston]] \u2013 [[David Livingstone]] (1813\u20131873), Scottish missionary and explorer has this Delmonico's soup named after him, also available in celery.\n* [[Loganberry]] \u2013 a cross of a blackberry and a raspberry, was accidentally created in 1883 in Santa Cruz, California, by the American lawyer and horticulturist [[James Harvey Logan]].\n* [[Crab Louis]]<ref name=\"Gilbar15\"/> \u2013 (pronounced Loo-ey) while [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] is often cited as the inspiration because of his notorious fondness for food, [[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane)]] in Spokane, Washington claims [[Louis Davenport]] is the name source and inventor. Davenport was a Spokane restaurateur from 1889 on, and opened the hotel in 1914. There are several other alleged creators, including [[Victor Hirtzler]] (see [[Celery Victor]]).\n* [[Macaroni Lucullus]] \u2013 [[Lucullus]] (c. 106\u201356 BC), full name Lucius Licinius Lucullus Ponticus, was perhaps the earliest recorded gastronome in the Western world. After a long spell of wars, the Roman general retired to a life of indulgence and opulence, most evident in his gardens and his cuisine. His name has become associated with numerous dishes of the over-the-top sort, using [[haute cuisine]]'s favorite luxury staples\u2014truffles, foie gras, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, sweetbreads, cockscombs, game, Madeira, and so on. Macaroni Lucullus incorporates truffles and foie gras.\n* [[Lussekatter]], [[St. Lucia buns]] \u2013 Swedish saffron buns named for [[Saint Lucia]] of Syracuse (283\u2013304), whose name day, December 13, was once considered the [[longest night of the year]]. As Lucia means light, the saint was incorporated into the celebration when these buns are traditionally eaten. The Swedish term, Lucia's cats, refers to the bun's curled shape.\n* [[Luther Burger]] \u2013 a hamburger or cheeseburger with one or more glazed doughnuts in place of the bun was allegedly named for and was a favorite (and possible invention) of singer, songwriter and record producer [[Luther Vandross]] (1951\u20132005).\n* [[Dean Lyder]] \u2013 a cocktail which is a variation on the perfect [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]].

[[Mamie Eisenhower]] was First Lady from 1952 to 1960.\n* [[Mapo doufu]] \u2013 the name Mapo (\u9ebb\u5a46) is thought to refer to a (possibly fictional) old pockmarked-face lady<ref name=\"Skidelsky 2012\"/> by the name of Chen, who invented and sold the dish. It is thus sometimes translated as \"Pockmarked-Face Lady's Tofu\", or \"Pockmarked Mother Chen's Tofu\".\n* [[Sole Marco Polo]] \u2013 the great explorer and traveler [[Marco Polo]] (1254\u20131324) has this dish of sole with lobster and, somewhat oddly, tomato, named after him.\n* [[\u00c0 la Mar\u00e9chale]] \u2013 [[Marshal of France|Marshal]]'s wife style.

It is unknown after whom the recipe is named. It is speculated that it could be associated with the Mar\u00e9chale de Luxembourg (1707\u20131787), the wife of [[Duke of Piney-Luxembourg|Charles-Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Montmorency-Luxembourg]] (1702\u20131764) and a major society hostess.\n* [[Margarita]] \u2013 there are many claims for the name of this tequila/lime/orange liqueur cocktail. Dallas socialite [[Margarita Samas]] said she invented it in 1948 for one of her Acapulco parties. Enrique Bastate Gutierrez claimed he invented it in Tijuana in the 1940s for [[Rita Hayworth]]. Hayworth's real name was Margarita Cansino, and another story connects the drink to her during an earlier time when she was dancing in Tijuana nightclubs under that name. Carlos Herrera said he created and named the cocktail in his Tijuana restaurant in 1938\u20131939 for [[Marjorie King]]. Ms. King was reportedly allergic to all alcohol except tequila, and had asked for something besides a straight shot. Around this same general time period, Nevada bartender Red Hinton said he'd named the cocktail after his girlfriend [[Margarita Mendez]]. Other stories exist.\n* [[Pizza Margherita]] \u2013 Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] (1851\u20131926) was presented with this pizza in the colors of the Italian flag on a trip to Naples, c. 1889. Many people claimed to have created it.\n* [[Sole Marguery]] \u2013 [[Nicholas Marguery]] (1834\u20131910), famed French chef, created and named this dish, along with others, for himself and his restaurant Marguery in Paris.\n* The [[Marie biscuit]], a type of biscuit similar to a rich tea biscuit also known as Mar\u00eda biscuit or Maria cookie (Netherlands), was created by the London bakery Peek Freans in 1874 to commemorate the marriage of the Grand Duchess [[Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]] to the Duke of Edinburgh.[1][2] It became popular throughout Europe, particularly in Spain where, following the Civil War, the biscuit became a symbol of the country's economic recovery after bakeries produced mass quantities to consume a surplus of wheat.\n* [[Chicken Maria Theresia]] \u2013 [[Maria Theresia]] (1717\u20131780), Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and wife of Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz I]]. [[Coffee Maria Theresia]] includes cream and orange liqueur.\n* [[Consomm\u00e9 Marie Stuart]] \u2013 [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] (1542\u20131587), Queen of Scots, was appropriatedly Frenchified by Ranhofer in naming this dish. She, herself, had adopted Stuart vs. Stewart while living in France.\n* [[Martha Washington's Cake]] \u2013 [[Martha Washington]] (1731\u20131802), wife of [[George Washington]], is remembered for this fruitcake. Her original recipe for her \"Great Cake\" called for 40 eggs, 5 pounds of fruit, and similar quantities of other ingredients.\n* [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] \u2013 a popular cocktail containing vodka, tomato juice, and usually other spices or flavorings, named after [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I of England]],\n* [[Poires Mary Garden]] \u2013 [[Mary Garden]] (1874\u20131967) was a hugely popular opera singer in Europe and the U.S. at the start of the 20th century. Born in Scotland, she emigrated to the U.S. as a child, then came to Paris in 1897 to complete her training. After her 1900 debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, she was much sought-after by composers for starring roles in their operas. [[Escoffier]] made this dish in her honor, and is said to have told a friend once that all his best dishes had been created \"for the ladies\". (see Melba, Rachel, R\u00e9jane, et al. below)\n* [[Mary Jane (candy)|Mary Jane]] \u2013 peanut butter and molasses candy bars developed by [[Charles N.

Served at [[Arnold's Bar and Grill]] and Mullane's Parkside Cafe, both of Cincinnati.\n* [[Massillon]] \u2013 the small almond pastry is named for noted French bishop and preacher [[Jean-Baptiste Massillon]] (1663\u20131742), a temporary favorite of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. The pastry originated in the town of Hy\u00e8res, where Massillon was born.\n* [[P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud ris de veau \u00e0 la McAllister]] \u2013 most likely, [[Samuel Ward McAllister]] (1827\u20131895) is the name source of the hot veal p\u00e2t\u00e9 Charles Ranhofer created at Delmonico's. McAllister was best known for his list of the 400 people he considered New York City society.\n* [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]] apple \u2013 [[John McIntosh (farmer)|John McIntosh]] (1777\u20131846), American-Canadian farmer who discovered the variety in Ontario, Canada in 1796 or 1811.\n* [[Peach Melba]] \u2013 [[Dame Nellie Melba]] (1861\u20131931).

In 1892\u20131893, she was living at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, which was then managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] and [[Auguste Escoffier]]. During an illness, the singer favored some extremely dry toast which was subsequently named for her. Around this same time, Escoffier created the dessert [[Peach Melba]] in her honor. There is also a Melba garnish (raspberry sauce) that is an ingredient of Peach Melba.\n* [[Bisque of shrimps \u00e0 la Melville]] \u2013 when the great American author [[Herman Melville]] (1819\u20131891) died in New York, he had been almost forgotten for decades.

If you have several days available, you can make it yourself.<ref>http://www.soupsong.com/zjun04.html</ref>\n* [[Mornay sauce]] \u2013 diplomat and writer [[Philippe de Mornay]] (1549\u20131623), a member of [[Henri IV]]'s court, is often cited as the name source for this popular cheese version of [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]]. The alternative story is that 19th-century French chef [[Joseph Voiron]] invented it and named it after one of his cooks, Mornay, his oldest son.\n* [[Mozartkugel]] \u2013 Salzburg, the birthplace of composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791), is also the place where this marzipan/nougat-filled chocolate was created c. 1890. Also in the composer's honor, Ranhofer created \"Galantine of pullet \u00e0 la Mozart\" at Delmonico's.\n* [[Lamb cutlets Murillo]] \u2013 [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] (1617\u20131682), the influential Spanish painter, was apparently a favorite artist of Charles Ranhofer.\n\n== N ==\n* [[Nachos]] \u2013 first created c. 1943 by [[Ignacio Anaya|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya]], the original nachos consisted of fried corn tortillas covered with melted cheddar cheese and  jalape\u00f1o peppers.<ref name=\"Fox News 2014\"/><ref>Gilbar 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEbXaQALeUC&pg=PA6 pp. 6-7].</ref>\n* Napoleon \u2013 an alternate name for [[mille-feuille]], was probably ''not'' named for the Emperor, but for the city of Naples.\n* [[Napoleon Brandy]] \u2013 a sort of [[brandy]] named for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* [[Bigarreau Napoleon cherry]] \u2013 unlike the pastry, the French cherry ''was'' most likely named after [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], his son [[Napoleon II]], or his nephew [[Napoleon III]]. The sweet, white-fleshed (bigarreau) cherry often used in maraschino cherry production fell into the hands of Oregon's Seth Luelling of Bing cherry fame (the Napoleon is a forebear of the Bing), and he renamed it the Royal Anne. Subsequently, the cherry also became known as [[Queen Anne cherry]] in North America.\n* [[Lord Nelson apple]] \u2013 [[Admiral Horatio Nelson]] (1758\u20131805), British hero of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

The chef, [[Charles Ranhofer]], reproduced the dish for him and put it on the restaurant menu as Lobster Wenberg. Allegedly, the two men had a falling-out, Ranhofer took the dish off the menu, and returned it, renamed, only at other customers' insistence.\n* [[Marshal Ney (dessert)|Marshal Ney]] \u2013 the elaborate Ranhofer dessert\u2014molded tiers of meringue shells, vanilla custard, and marzipan\u2014is named after Napoleon's Marshal [[Michel Ney]] (1769\u20131815), who led the retreat from Moscow and was a commander at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].\n\n== O ==\n* [[Potatoes O'Brien]] \u2013 possibly [[William Smith O'Brien]] (1803\u20131864), who led the Irish revolt subsequent to the 1844 [[Irish Potato Famine (1845\u20131849)|Potato Famine]] is the source of the name.\n* [[Bath Oliver]] biscuits \u2013 [[Dr William Oliver]] (1695\u20131764) of [[Bath, England]] concocted these as a digestive aid for his patients.

In the U.S., Ranhofer made a dish of hashed mutton Omer Pasha, as well as eggs on a dish.\n* [[Veal Prince Orloff]] \u2013 Count [[Gregory Orloff]], paramour of tzarina [[Catherine the Great]] is often cited. Much more likely, [[Urbain Dubois]], noted 19th-century French chef, created the dish for his veal-hating employer Prince [[Nicolas Orloff]], minister to tzar [[Nicolas I]], hence the multiple sauces and seasonings. Stuffed pheasant \u00e0 la Prince Orloff was created by Charles Ranhofer.\n* [[Veal Oscar]] \u2013 Sweden's King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] (1829\u20131907) The dish was first served at Restaurant Operak\u00e4llaren, Stockholm, Sweden in 1897 in conjunction with the world fair. It was composed by the French m\u00e2itre de cuisine of the Operak\u00e4llaren restaurant, Paul Edmond Malaise, for the 25th anniversary of the accession of King Oscar II to the throne. [[Choron sauce]] that has the color of red as the same as the kings royal mantle is piped in the shape of an \"O\" around a slice of fried fillet of veal. On top the fillet, a white slice of lobster tail and a slice of black truffle are placed to symbolize the black and white outer trimming on the royal mantle and you create King Oscar's crowned monogram. This is topped with two white sticks of asparagus, forming a Roman number two as for the number of the king being Oscar the 2nd.

[[Escoffier]] named several dishes for her, including consomm\u00e9, sole, and \u0153ufs \u00e0 la neige.\n* [[Reuben sandwich]] \u2013 possibly [[Reuben Kolakofsky]] (1874\u20131960) made it for a poker group gathered at his restaurant in an Omaha, Nebraska [[Blackstone Hotel|hotel]] c. 1925, or [[Arnold Reuben]], a New York restaurateur (1883\u20131970), may have created and named it c. 1914.\n* [[Rigo Jancsi|Rig\u00f3 Jancsi]] \u2013 the Viennese chocolate and cream pastry<ref name=\"Gundel 1992\">{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 130</ref> is named after the Gypsy violinist, [[Rigo Jancsi|Rig\u00f3 Jancsi]]<ref name=\"Gundel 1992\"/> (by Hungarian use, Rig\u00f3 is his last name, Jancsi his first, called literally 'Blackbird Johnny'). He is perhaps best known for his part in one of the great late-19th-century society ''scandales''. In 1896, [[Clara Ward, Princesse de Caraman-Chimay]]. The Princesse de Chimay saw the charming Rig\u00f3 Jancsi, first violinist playing [[N\u00f3ta|Hungarian Gypsy music]] in a Paris restaurant in 1896 while dining with her husband, [[Prince de Chimay]]. She ran off with Rig\u00f3, married him, divorced him, and later married two other men too.\n* [[Robert E. Lee Cake]] \u2013 southern U.S. lemon layer cake named for [[American Civil War]] General [[Robert E. Lee]] (1807\u20131870).\n* [[Strawberries Romanoff]] \u2013 although there are a number of claimants for the creation of this dish, including the Hollywood restaurateur self-styled \"[[Michael Romanoff|Prince Michael Romanoff]]\", credit is most often given to [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]], when he was chef to tzar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] around 1820. [[Romanoff]] was the house name of the Russian rulers.\n* [[Ronald Reagan's Hamburger Soup]] \u2013 [[Ronald Reagan]], while President, had this recipe issued publicly in 1986, after he had gotten flak for saying he liked French soups.<ref name=\"Skidelsky 2012\"/>\n* [[Ross Sauce]] \u2013 a multipurpose barbecue sauce invented by Scott Ross in Habersham County, Georgia. Scott Ross, a high school chemistry teacher and wrestling coach, says that his sauce \"goes great on anything\" suggesting salad, popcorn, and almost anything but meats.\n* [[Tournedos Rossini]] \u2013 [[Gioacchino Rossini]] (1792\u20131868), Italian composer known almost as well as a gastronome. A friend of [[Car\u00eame]], [[Prince Metternich]], et al., Rossini had many dishes named for him: eggs, chicken, soup, salad, cannelloni, sole, risotto, pheasant, and more. [[Escoffier]] was responsible for many of these. Charles Ranhofer created \"Meringued pancakes \u00e0 la Rossini.\"\n* [[Souffl\u00e9 Rothschild]] \u2013 a dessert souffl\u00e9 created by [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] for Baron [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792\u20131868) and Baroness [[Betty de Rothschild]] (1805\u20131886) in the 1820s. The Baron was a notable French banker and diplomat. It was originally flavoured with [[Goldwasser]] but is now flavoured with a variety of other liqueurs and spirits including [[Kirschwasser|kirsch]]. This dessert was a favourite of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] (1900\u20132002).\n* [[Rumford's Soup]] \u2013 [[Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]]\n* [[Runeberg torte]] (''Runebergintorttu / Runebergst\u00e5rta'') \u2013 named after the Finnish poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] (1804\u20131877) and his wife, writer [[Fredrika Runeberg]] (1807\u20131879), who invented the pastry. Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday, 5 February, is in Finland Runeberg-day and it is celebrated with this almond-pastry. There is also a variation of this called the Fredrika-pastry.\n* [[Baby Ruth]] candy bar \u2013 most likely, [[Babe Ruth]] (1895\u20131948) was the inspiration for the name. Although the Curtiss Candy Co. has insisted from the beginning that the candy bar was named after a daughter of [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Ruth Cleveland]] died in 1904 at the age of 12, while the Baby Ruth was introduced in 1921 right at a time when George Herman Ruth, Jr. had become a baseball superstar. Very early versions of the wrapper offer a baseball glove for 79 cents. Babe Ruth's announced intent to sue the company is probably what drove and perpetuated the dubious cover story.\n\n== S ==\n[[File:Beef Stroganoff on Pasta.jpg|thumb|[[Beef Stroganoff]] served atop pasta]]\n* [[Sachertorte]] \u2013 [[Franz Sacher]], Vienna, 1832, working for [[Prince Metternich]].\n* [[Chicken filets Sadi Carnot]] \u2013 chef Charles Ranhofer almost certainly had French President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot]] (1837\u20131894) in mind, not his uncle, the physicist [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] (1796\u20131832).\n* [[Flan Sagan]] \u2013 see [[Talleyrand]] below. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]]-P\u00e9rigord held the title of Prince of [[\u017baga\u0144]]. This flan of truffles, mushrooms, and calves' brains was one of several Sagan-named dishes, usually involving brains, including a garnish and scrambled eggs.\n* [[Salisbury steak]] \u2013 [[Dr. James H. Salisbury]] (1823\u20131905), early U.S. health food advocate, created this dish and advised his patients to eat it three times a day, while limiting their intake of \"poisonous\" vegetables and starches.\n* [[Beef hash Sam Ward]] \u2013 [[Samuel Cutler Ward]] (1814\u20131884) was perhaps the most influential Washington lobbyist of the mid-19th century. He was as well known for his entertaining as his political work, apparently agreeing with Talleyrand that dining well was essential to diplomacy. Why Ranhofer named a beef hash after him is open to speculation.\n* [[Sandwich]] \u2013 [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]] (1718\u20131792) did not invent the sandwich. Meat between slices of bread had been eaten long before him. But as the often-repeated story goes, his title name was applied to it c. 1762, after he frequently called for the easily handled food while entertaining friends. Their card games then were not interrupted by the need for forks and such.\n* [[Sarah Bernhardt Cakes]] \u2013 French actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] (1844\u20131923). The pastry may be Danish in origin. There is a Sole Sarah Bernhardt, and a [[souffl\u00e9]]. \"Sarah Bernhardt\" may indicate a dish garnished with a pur\u00e9e of foie gras, and Delmonico's \"Sarah Potatoes\", by Charles Ranhofer, are most likely named for the actress.\n* [[Eggs Sardou]] \u2013 Invented at the New Orleans restaurant [[Antoine's]] and named after the French dramatist [[Victorien Sardou]]\n* [[Schillerlocken]] \u2013 two quite distinct foods named after the curly hair of the German poet [[Friedrich von Schiller]] (1759\u20131805). One is cream-filled puff pastry cornets; the other is long strips of smoked [[Squalidae|dogfish]] belly flaps. Ranhofer named a dessert of pancakes rolled up, sliced, and layered in a mold [[Schiller pudding]].\n* [[Seckel pear]] \u2013 although little is known about the origin of this American pear, it is generally believed that a Pennsylvania farmer named [[Seckel]] discovered the fruit in the Delaware River Valley near Philadelphia, in the 18th or early 19th century.\n* [[Lobster cutlets \u00e0 la Shelley]] \u2013 [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792\u20131822), the great English poet, drowned off the coast of Italy. Charles Ranhofer remembered him with this.\n* [[Shirley Temple cocktail|Shirley Temple]] \u2013 the classic children's cocktail of club soda, [[grenadine]], and a maraschino cherry was invented in the late 1930s at Hollywood's [[Chasen's]] restaurant for the child star [[Shirley Temple]] (1928\u20132014). A slice of orange and a straw is suggested; the paper parasol is optional.\n* [[Reinette Simirenko]] \u2013 an apple variety discovered by Ukrainian pomologist Lev Simirenko in his garden and named after his father Platon Simirenko. The origin of this cultivar is unclear. It was one of the most widely grown apple varieties in the Soviet Union.\n* [[Veal Sinatra]] \u2013 a veal stuffed with a buttery cream sauce, vegetables, meat and/or seafood named after the famous jazz singer [[Frank Sinatra]]\n* [[Soubise sauce]] \u2013 the onion pur\u00e9e or b\u00e9chamel sauce with added onion pur\u00e9e is probably named after the 18th-century aristocrat [[Charles de Rohan]], Prince de Soubise, and Marshal of France.\n* [[Eggs Stanley]] \u2013 [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]] (1841\u20131904), the famed British explorer, has several dishes named for him, usually with onions and a small amount of curry seasoning. A recipe for these poached eggs has a sauce with 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder.\n* [[Beef Stroganoff]] \u2013 a 19th-century Russian dish, named for a [[Count Stroganov]] (possibly Count [[Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov]] or Count [[Grigory Dmitriyevich Stroganov]])\n* [[Sukjunamul]] \u2013 [[Shin Suk-ju]]\n* [[Crepes Suzette]] \u2013 said to have been created for then-Prince of Wales [[Edward VII]] on 31 January 1896, at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in [[Monte Carlo]]. When the prince ordered a special dessert for himself and a young female companion, [[Henri Charpentier]], then 16 (1880\u20131961), produced the flaming crepe dish. Edward reportedly asked that the dessert be named after his companion (Suzette) rather than himself. However, [[Larousse Gastronomique|Larousse]] disputes Charpentier's claim.\n* [[Ellen Svinhufvud cake]] \u2013 named in 1930s after [[Ellen Svinhufvud]] (1869\u20131953), the wife of President of Finland [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]]. \n* [[Sydney Smith's salad dressing]] \u2013 Salad dressing named after founder of the [[Edinburgh Review]], [[Sydney Smith]] (1771\u20131845). He was a clergyman who wrote a poem which describes how to make this salad. Popular in the 19th century among American cooks.\n\n== T ==\n[[File:Takuan.jpg|thumb|[[Takuan]]]]\n[[File:General Tso's Chicken.JPG|thumb|[[General Tso's chicken]]]]\n* [[Takuan]] \u2013 named after [[Takuan S\u014dh\u014d]], it is pickled [[daikon|daikon radish]]\n* [[Talleyrand]] \u2013 a pineapple [[savarin cake|savarin]] is one of many dishes named for the epicurean French statesman Charles Maurice de [[Talleyrand]]-P\u00e9rigord (1754\u20131838). An influential negotiator at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Talleyrand considered dining a major part of [[diplomacy]]. Antonin C\u00e2reme worked for him for a time, and Talleyrand was instrumental in furthering his career. The host's eponymous dishes include sauces, tournedos, veal, croquettes, orange fritters, et al.\n* [[Tarte Tatin]] \u2013 [[Stephine Tatin]] (1838\u20131917) and [[Caroline Tatin]] (1847\u20131911). In French, the tarte is known as \u00e0 la Demoiselles Tatin for the sisters who ran the [[Hotel Tatin]] in Lamotte Beuvron, France. Stephine allegedly invented the upside-down tart accidentally in the fall of 1898, but the pastry may be much older.\n* [[Beef Tegetthoff]] \u2013 Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] (1827\u20131871), Austrian naval hero, is celebrated by this beef dish with seafood rag\u00f4ut.\n* [[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]] \u2013 named for operatic soprano [[Luisa Tetrazzini]],<ref name=\"Gilbar30\">Gilbar 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEbXaQALeUC&pg=PA30 p. 30].</ref> the \"Florentine Nightingale\" (1871\u20131941), and created in San Francisco.\n* [[Tootsie Rolls]] \u2013 [[Clara \"Tootsie\" Hirshfield]], the small daughter of [[Leo Hirshfield]], developer of the first paper-wrapped penny candy, in New York, 1896.\n* [[Biscuit Tortoni]] \u2013 the Italian Tortoni, working at the Caf\u00e9 Velloni which had opened in Paris in 1798, bought the place and renamed it the [[Caf\u00e9 Tortoni (Paris)|Caf\u00e9 Tortoni]]. It became a very successful restaurant and ice cream parlor in the 19th century. This ice cream dish is said to be one of his creations.\n* [[General Tso's chicken]] \u2013 Named for General [[Zu\u01d2 Z\u014dngt\u00e1ng]] (1812\u20131885; variously spelled Tzo, Cho, Zo, Zhou, etc.) of the [[Qing Dynasty]],<ref name=\"Gilbar30\"/> although it was not contemporaneous with him.\n\n== U ==\n* [[Chicken Soup Ujh\u00e1zi]] \u2013 said to have been made of rooster originally, this soup was the creation of amateur chef and well-known Hungarian actor [[Ede Ujh\u00e1zi]] c. 1900.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n* [[Cases of squabs Umberto]] \u2013 [[Umberto I]] (1844\u20131900), king of Italy and husband of pizza's [[Queen Margherita]], has this Delmonico's dish by Ranhofer named after him.\n\n== V ==\n[[File:Celery Victor (7033758499).jpg|thumb|[[Celery Victor]]]]\n* [[Pur\u00e9e of wild ducks van Buren]] \u2013 [[Martin van Buren]] (1782\u20131862), 8th president of the United States, developed a taste for French cuisine while a minister in London, where he became acquainted with [[Talleyrand]]'s dining philosophy. During his presidency, [[White House]] dinners were even more French than in Jefferson's day. Ranhofer may have been returning the compliment with this soup.\n* [[Van Gogh potato]] \u2013 artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853\u20131890) is commemorated by this potato developed in the Netherlands in 1976.\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Soupe aux truffes noires VGE|fr}} \u2013 dedicated to [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] (abbreviated '''VGE''') and created by [[Paul Bocuse]] in 1975.\n* [[Fillets of Brill V\u00e9ron]] \u2013 Dr. [[Louis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 V\u00e9ron]] (1798\u20131867) gave up his Parisian medical practice for the more fashionable life as a writer, manager of the Opera, paramour of the actress [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]], political influence, and pre-eminent host of lavish dinners for the elite. [[V\u00e9ron sauce]] accompanies the brill.\n* [[Celery Victor]] \u2013 [[Victor Hirtzler]], (c. 1875\u20131935) well-known American chef from Strasbourg, France considered this braised celery dish one of his two best recipes, the other being [[Sole Edward VII]]. Both dishes were created at San Francisco's [[St. Francis Hotel]], where Hirtzler was head chef from 1904 to 1926. His 1919 cookbook can be seen in full at Hotel St. Francis Cookbook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_73.cfm|title=Feeding America|publisher=}}</ref> \n* [[Lamb chops Victor Hugo]] \u2013 the renowned French author, [[Victor Hugo]] (1802\u20131885), is commemorated with these, and with fillets of plover.\n* [[Victoria plum]] and [[Victoria Sponge]] or Sandwich Cake \u2013 [[Queen Victoria]] (1819\u20131901). Many dishes are named for the British Queen, including sole, eggs, salad, a garnish, several sauces, a cherry spice cake, a bombe, small tarts, et al. There is also a [[Victoria pea]] and a [[Victoria apple]].\n* [[Vidal blanc]] \u2013 a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] grape variety, named after its breeder, [[Jean-Louis Vidal]]\n\n== W ==\n[[File:Beef Wellington - Crosscut.jpg|thumb|A cross-section view of a [[Beef Wellington]] sliced open]]\n\n* [[Waldorf salad]] \u2013 salad made at the Waldorf hotel originally as a joke for a particularly persnickety patron. \n* [[Wallenberg Steak]] \u2013 Scandinavian dish of minced veal named after the prominent and wealthy Swedish [[Wallenberg family]]. Contemporary versions use turkey and moose meat.\n* Wild Duckling \u00e0 la Walter Scott \u2013 dish named for the Scottish writer [[Walter Scott]] (1771\u20131832) includes Dundee marmalade and whisky.\n* [[Pears Wanamaker]] \u2013 of the Philadelphia merchant Wanamaker family, [[Rodman Wanamaker]] (1863\u20131928) seems most likely to be the inspiration for this dish. The son of [[John Wanamaker]], founder of the family business, Rodman Wanamaker went to Paris in 1889 to oversee the Paris branch of their department store. When he returned to the U.S. in 1899, he kept his Paris home and contacts.\n* [[Washington Pie]] \u2013 [[George Washington]] (1732\u20131799), first U.S. president, has this cake named after him, as well as a French sauce or garnish containing corn.\n* [[Beef Wellington]] \u2013 [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (1769\u20131852), British hero of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], has this dish of beef with p\u00e2t\u00e9, mushrooms, truffles and Madeira sauce, all encased in a pastry crust, named after him. It was probably created by his personal chef. Theories vary: either the Duke had no sense of taste and didn't care what he was eating (leaving his chef to his own devices), or he loved the dish so much that it had to be served at every formal dinner, or the shape of the concoction resembles the [[Wellington boot]].\n* [[Lobster Wenberg]] \u2013 see [[Lobster Newberg]].\n* [[Wibele]] \u2013 Jakob Christian Carl Wibel, he invented this sweet pastry in 1763\n* [[Fraises Wilhelmine]] \u2013 A dessert of strawberries, macerated in orange juice, powdered sugar and [[kirsch]], served with Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, created by [[Auguste Escoffier]] and named after [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. [[Wilhelmina Pepermunt]], a Dutch peppermint candy, is also named after her.\n* [[Prince William Cider Apple]] \u2013 Created to celebrate the 21st birthday of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]]. It was named the \"Prince William\" after he said in an interview that he was a [[cider]] drinker. Large, robust yet mild in nature with a red flush and will make a cider of fair complexion, well balanced with much character. The \"Prince William\" will be the first of more than 360 varieties of traditional English cider apples grown over the centuries to be given a royal name.\n* [[Fillets \u00e0 la Peg Woffington]] \u2013 [[Peg Woffington]], Irish actress (1720\u20131760). A recipe exists for \"Woffington Sauce\" for fish, and also for an orange-based sweet, [[Corbeilles \u00e0 la Peg Woffington]].\n* [[Eggs Woodhouse]] - Named after [[List_of_Archer_characters#Recurring_characters|Woodhouse]], long suffering valet of [[List_of_Archer_characters#Sterling_Archer|Sterling Archer]] in the animated sitcom [[Archer_(2009_TV_series)|Archer]].  It is a variation of Eggs Benedict, with the main differences being the addition of artichoke hearts, creamed spinach, bechamel sauce, Ib\u00e9rico ham, black truffle and beluga caviar.<ref>https://onthegas.org/food/eggs-woodhouse</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy1vLBf4CqI</ref>\n* [[Woolton pie]] \u2013 [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton]]. Lord Woolton was the British Minister of Food during World War II. This root vegetable pie created by the chefs at London's [[Savoy Hotel]] marked Woolton's drive to get people to eat more vegetables instead of meat.\n\n== X ==\n* [[Potage \u00e0 la Xavier]] \u2013 this cream soup with chicken has at least two stories associated with its name. Some sources say that the gourmand [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (1755\u20131824) invented the soup when he was Comte de Provence, and known as Louis Stanislas Xavier de France. Others suggest the soup was named after [[Francis Xavier]] (1506\u20131552), a Basque missionary to Goa and India.\n\n== Y ==\n* [[Yemas de Santa Teresa|Yemas de Santa Theresa de \u00c1vila]] \u2013 these sweets made from lemon-flavoured candied egg yolks from the Spanish city of \u00c1vila are named after its Saint, [[Theresa of \u00c1vila]].\n\n==Food-related==\n* [[Pasteurization]] \u2013 [[Louis Pasteur]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of words derived from toponyms]]\n* [[List of foods and drinks named after places]]\n* [[Lists of etymologies]]\n{{Portalbar|Food|Biography|Society|Lists}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Fox News 2014\">{{cite web | title=Foods you didn't know were named after people | website=[[Fox News]] | date=June 5, 2014 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/06/05/foods-didnt-know-were-named-after-people/ | accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Skidelsky 2012\">{{cite web | last=Skidelsky | first=William | title=The 10 best foods named after people \u2013 in pictures | website=[[The Guardian]] | date=February 4, 2012 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/feb/05/ten-best-foods-named-after-people-in-pictures | accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Gilbar | first=S. | title=Chicken A La King And The Buffalo Wing: Food Names And The People And Places That Inspired Them | publisher=F+W Media | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-58297-525-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEbXaQALeUC}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Commons category|Food named for people}}\n* [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100212205808/http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_ranhofer.html ''The Epicurean'' by Charles Ranhofer.] Cookbook including many dishes [[Charles Ranhofer|Ranhofer]] named after various individuals.

The scallop's shell became an emblem of the pilgrimage as it was used as a water cup along the way, and sewn to the pilgrims' clothes like a badge.

In Spanish, the scallop has \"pilgrims\" as part of its name, rather than Santiago.\n* [[Jansson's Temptation]] \u2013 thought to be named after the Swedish opera singer [[Per Janzon]] (1844\u20131889).\n* [[Apricots with rice \u00e0 la Jefferson]] \u2013 [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743\u20131826), third U.S. president, is honored appropriately with this Ranhofer dessert and with [[Jefferson rice]], a recently developed strain of Texas rice.

Dallas socialite [[Margarita Samas]] said she invented it in 1948 for one of her Acapulco parties. Enrique Bastate Gutierrez claimed he invented it in Tijuana in the 1940s for [[Rita Hayworth]].

There is also a frozen dessert, \"Plombi\u00e8re Montesquieu.\"\n* [[Potage anglais de poisson \u00e0 Lady Morgan]] \u2013 [[Lady Morgan]], n\u00e9e [[Sydney Owenson]] (1776\u20131859), a popular Irish novelist, was visiting Baron [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] in 1829, when C\u00e2reme created this elaborate fish soup in her honor. If you have several days available, you can make it yourself.<ref>http://www.soupsong.com/zjun04.html</ref>\n* [[Mornay sauce]] \u2013 diplomat and writer [[Philippe de Mornay]] (1549\u20131623), a member of [[Henri IV]]'s court, is often cited as the name source for this popular cheese version of [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]]. The alternative story is that 19th-century French chef [[Joseph Voiron]] invented it and named it after one of his cooks, Mornay, his oldest son.\n* [[Mozartkugel]] \u2013 Salzburg, the birthplace of composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791), is also the place where this marzipan/nougat-filled chocolate was created c. 1890. Also in the composer's honor, Ranhofer created \"Galantine of pullet \u00e0 la Mozart\" at Delmonico's.\n* [[Lamb cutlets Murillo]] \u2013 [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] (1617\u20131682), the influential Spanish painter, was apparently a favorite artist of Charles Ranhofer.\n\n== N ==\n* [[Nachos]] \u2013 first created c. 1943 by [[Ignacio Anaya|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya]], the original nachos consisted of fried corn tortillas covered with melted cheddar cheese and  jalape\u00f1o peppers.<ref name=\"Fox News 2014\"/><ref>Gilbar 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEbXaQALeUC&pg=PA6 pp. 6-7].</ref>\n* Napoleon \u2013 an alternate name for [[mille-feuille]], was probably ''not'' named for the Emperor, but for the city of Naples.\n* [[Napoleon Brandy]] \u2013 a sort of [[brandy]] named for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* [[Bigarreau Napoleon cherry]] \u2013 unlike the pastry, the French cherry ''was'' most likely named after [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], his son [[Napoleon II]], or his nephew [[Napoleon III]]. The sweet, white-fleshed (bigarreau) cherry often used in maraschino cherry production fell into the hands of Oregon's Seth Luelling of Bing cherry fame (the Napoleon is a forebear of the Bing), and he renamed it the Royal Anne. Subsequently, the cherry also became known as [[Queen Anne cherry]] in North America.\n* [[Lord Nelson apple]] \u2013 [[Admiral Horatio Nelson]] (1758\u20131805), British hero of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Nelson also has a dish of mutton cutlets named after him, as well as an early-19th-century boiled sweet (or hard candy) somewhat indelicately called \"Nelson's balls.\"\n* [[Nesselrode Pudding]] \u2013 Russian diplomat Count [[Karl Robert von Nesselrode]] (1780\u20131862) had several dishes named for him, usually containing chestnuts, like this iced dessert.\n* [[Lobster Newberg]] \u2013 variously spelled Newburg and Newburgh, and now applied to other seafood besides lobster, this dish is usually attributed to a Captain [[Ben Wenberg]], who brought the recipe he had supposedly found in his travels to [[Delmonico's]] in the late 19th century. The chef, [[Charles Ranhofer]], reproduced the dish for him and put it on the restaurant menu as Lobster Wenberg. Allegedly, the two men had a falling-out, Ranhofer took the dish off the menu, and returned it, renamed, only at other customers' insistence.\n* [[Marshal Ney (dessert)|Marshal Ney]] \u2013 the elaborate Ranhofer dessert\u2014molded tiers of meringue shells, vanilla custard, and marzipan\u2014is named after Napoleon's Marshal [[Michel Ney]] (1769\u20131815), who led the retreat from Moscow and was a commander at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].\n\n== O ==\n* [[Potatoes O'Brien]] \u2013 possibly [[William Smith O'Brien]] (1803\u20131864), who led the Irish revolt subsequent to the 1844 [[Irish Potato Famine (1845\u20131849)|Potato Famine]] is the source of the name.\n* [[Bath Oliver]] biscuits \u2013 [[Dr William Oliver]] (1695\u20131764) of [[Bath, England]] concocted these as a digestive aid for his patients. Oliver had opened a bath for the treatment of [[gout]], and was largely responsible for 18th-century Bath becoming a popular health resort.\n* [[Salade Olivier]] \u2013 a salad composed of diced vegetables and sometimes meat, bound in mayonnaise, invented in the 1860s by [[Lucien Olivier]], the chef of the [[Hermitage Restaurant]] in Moscow.\n* [[\u0152ufs sur le plat Omer Pasha]] \u2013 the Hungarian-Croatian Mihailo Latas known as [[Omer Pasha]] Latas (1806\u20131871), commander-in-chief of Turkish forces allied with the French and English during the [[Crimean War]] had this sort of Hungarian/Turkish dish of eggs named for him. In the U.S., Ranhofer made a dish of hashed mutton Omer Pasha, as well as eggs on a dish.\n* [[Veal Prince Orloff]] \u2013 Count [[Gregory Orloff]], paramour of tzarina [[Catherine the Great]] is often cited. Much more likely, [[Urbain Dubois]], noted 19th-century French chef, created the dish for his veal-hating employer Prince [[Nicolas Orloff]], minister to tzar [[Nicolas I]], hence the multiple sauces and seasonings. Stuffed pheasant \u00e0 la Prince Orloff was created by Charles Ranhofer.\n* [[Veal Oscar]] \u2013 Sweden's King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] (1829\u20131907) The dish was first served at Restaurant Operak\u00e4llaren, Stockholm, Sweden in 1897 in conjunction with the world fair. It was composed by the French m\u00e2itre de cuisine of the Operak\u00e4llaren restaurant, Paul Edmond Malaise, for the 25th anniversary of the accession of King Oscar II to the throne. [[Choron sauce]] that has the color of red as the same as the kings royal mantle is piped in the shape of an \"O\" around a slice of fried fillet of veal. On top the fillet, a white slice of lobster tail and a slice of black truffle are placed to symbolize the black and white outer trimming on the royal mantle and you create King Oscar's crowned monogram. This is topped with two white sticks of asparagus, forming a Roman number two as for the number of the king being Oscar the 2nd. Contemporary versions may substitute chicken and crab.\n* [[Oysters Rockefeller]] \u2013 a cooked [[hors d'ouervre]] identified with [[New Orleans]], it is named after [[John D. Rockefeller]]<ref name=\"Skidelsky 2012\"/><ref>Gilbar 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEbXaQALeUC&pg=PA7 p. 7].</ref>\n*[[Osmania Biscuit]] \u2013 biscuit named after [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], the last [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]<ref>https://www.vahrehvah.com/osmania-biscuit</ref>\n\n== P ==\n* [[Selle d'agneau \u00e0 la Paganini]] \u2013 [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] (1782\u20131840), Italian opera composer and brilliant violinist, has this lamb dish named after him, probably by Charles Ranhofer.\n*Parsnips Molly Parkin \u2013 [[Molly Parkin]], Welsh artist and novelist. The dish, comprising [[parsnip]], cream, tomatoes and cheese, was created for her by the food writer Denis Curtis in the 1970s. \n* [[Hachis Parmentier|Potatoes Parmentier]] \u2013 [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]] (1737\u20131817), chief proponent in reversing the French public view about the once-despised potato. Parmentier discovered the food value of the vegetable while a prisoner of war in Germany, where the potato had already been accepted.\n* [[Pastille]]s \u2013 [[Giovanni Pastilla]], Italian confectioner to Marie de' Medici, is said to have accompanied her to Paris on her marriage to Henri IV, and created some form of the tablets named after him there.\n* [[Lobster Paul Bert]] \u2013 [[Paul Bert]] (1833\u20131886) was a French physiologist, diplomat, and politician, but is perhaps best known for his research on the effect of air pressure on the body. Charles Ranhofer was either a friend or fan of the father of aerospace medicine.\n* [[Pavlova (food)|Pavlova]] \u2013 [[Anna Pavlova]] (1881\u20131931), Russian ballerina. Both Australia and New Zealand have claimed to be the source of the meringue (\"light as Pavlova\") and fruit dessert.\n* [[Pedro Ximenez]] \u2013 a [[Vitis vinifera|Vinifera]] grape, named after the soldier who allegedly brought it to Spain.\n* [[Dr Pepper]] \u2013 [[Charles T. Pepper]]. The soft drink invented by pharmacist Charles Atherton in 1885 at a Waco, Texas drugstore owned by [[Wade Morrison]] is said to be named for Morrison's first employer, who owned a pharmacy in Virginia.\n* [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (wine)]] \u2013 [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (person)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]] (1638\u20131715), (Pierre) a French Benedictine monk, expert winemaker and developer of the first true champagne in the late 17th century.\n* Eggs Picabia \u2013 Named by [[Gertrude Stein]] in her ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'' after [[Francis Picabia]] (22 January 1879 \u2013 30 November 1953) and his recipe.\n* [[Chicken Picasso]] \u2013 this creamy chicken dish was named after [[Pablo Picasso]].\n* [[Sole Picasso]] \u2013 this fruity fish was named after [[Pablo Picasso]]. The dish consists of fried or grilled sole and warm fruit in a ginger-lemon sauce.\n* [[Pio Quinto]] \u2013 this [[Nicaraguan cuisine|Nicaraguan]] dessert was named after [[Pope Pius V]].\n* [[Pizza Di Rosso]] \u2013 [[pizza]] topped with sliced tomatoes, black olives, [[mozzarella]], [[eggplant]] and [[capsicum]]. Named after Count Enrico Di Rosso who selected the ingredients to create this variety of vegetarian pizza the colours of which resemble the red and white of the Order of St. George of which the Count is Patron.\n* [[Pozharsky cutlet]] (or Pojarski) \u2013 Pozharsky family were innkeepers in [[Torzhok]], Russia. Darya Pozharskaya was favored by [[Tsar Nicholas I]] for her version of minced veal and chicken cutlets. An especially juicy and tender consistency was achieved by adding butter to minced meat. The originals were reformed on veal chop or chicken wing bones, respectively, for presentation.\n* [[Rissoles Pompadour]] \u2013 the [[Marquise de Pompadour]], Jeanne Poisson (1721\u20131764), official paramour of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] from 1745 until her death, has had many dishes named after her besides these savory fried pastries. Mme. Pompadour's interest in cooking is remembered with lamb, sole, chicken, beef, pheasant, garnishes, croquettes, cakes and desserts, created by a number of chefs during and after her life.\n* [[Praline]] \u2013 [[Caesar, duc de Choiseul|C\u00e9sar de Choiseul, Count du Plessis-Praslin]] (1598\u20131675), by his officer of the table [[Lassagne]], presented at the court of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The caramelized almond confection was transformed at some point in Louisiana to a pecan-based one. This praline has gone on to be known by another eponym in the U.S.: [[Aunt Bill's Brown Candy]]. Aunt Bill's identity is apparently unknown.\n* [[Princess cake]] \u2013 three Swedish princesses, [[Princess Margaretha of Sweden|Margaretha]] (later Princess of Denmark), [[Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|M\u00e4rtha]] (later Crown Princess of Norway), and [[Astrid of Sweden|Astrid]] (later Queen of the Belgians).<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.cisionwire.se/frodinge-mejeri/traditionsenlig-tartfrossa---prinsessyra-baddar-for-prinsesstartans-vecka-2 \n |title=Traditionsenlig t\u00e5rtfrossa \u2013 Prinsessyra b\u00e4ddar f\u00f6r prinsesst\u00e5rtans vecka \n |accessdate=2009-12-19 \n |date=2009-09-17 \n |publisher=[[Cision]]wire \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017062034/http://www.cisionwire.se/frodinge-mejeri/traditionsenlig-tartfrossa---prinsessyra-baddar-for-prinsesstartans-vecka-2 \n |archivedate=2010-10-17 \n |language=Swedish \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n</ref>\n* [[Prinzregententorte]] \u2013 [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria]]\n* [[Toronchino Procope]] \u2013 Charles Ranhofer named this ice cream dessert after the Sicilian [[Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli]], whose [[Caf\u00e9 Procope]], opening in Paris in 1686, introduced flavored ices to the French.\n\n== Q ==\n* [[Queen Mother's Cake]] \u2013 in the 1950s, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (1901\u20132002) was served this flourless chocolate cake by her friend [[Jan Smeterlin]] (1892\u20131967), well-known Polish pianist. Smeterlin had acquired the recipe in Austria, and the Queen Mother's fondness for the cake produced its name, via either Smeterlin, food writer [[Clementine Paddleford]] or dessert maven [[Maida Heatter]].\n* [[Queen of Sheba cake]] \u2013 the originally French [[g\u00e2teau de la reine Saba]], a chocolate cake, is named for the 10th-century-BC African [[Queen of Sheba]], guest of [[King Solomon]] of Israel.\n\n== R ==\n* [[Lamprey \u00e0 la Rabelais]] \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]] (c. 1484\u20131553), French monk, turned physician, turned famed writer and satirist, was honored in this dish by Delmonico's chef [[Charles Ranhofer]].\n* [[Tournedos Rachel]] \u2013 from singing in the streets of Paris as a child, Swiss-born [[Elisa-Rachel F\u00e9lix]] (1821\u20131858) went on to become known as the greatest French tragedienne of her day. Her stage name [[Rachel]] is used for a number of dishes\u2014consomm\u00e9, eggs, sweetbreads, et al.\u2014many created by [[Escoffier]]. In New York City, Charles Ranhofer created \"artichokes \u00e0 la Rachel\" in her honor.\n* [[Ramos Gin Fizz]] \u2013 [[Henry C. Ramos]], New Orleans bartender, created this cocktail c. 1888, at either Meyer's Restaurant or the Imperial Cabinet Saloon, and named it after himself.\n* [[Chicken Raphael Weill]] \u2013 [[Raphael Weill]] (1837\u20131920) arrived in San Francisco from France at the age of 18. Within a few years he had founded what was to be one of California's largest department stores. Later he helped found the well-known [[Bohemian Club]], which still exists. He liked to cook, and is remembered in San Francisco restaurants with this dish.\n* [[Reggie Bar]] \u2013 [[Reggie Jackson]] (born 1946), American baseball player of the 1970s, had this now-discontinued [[candy bar]] named for him.\n* [[Salad R\u00e9jane]] \u2013 [[Gabrielle R\u00e9jane]] was the stage name for Gabrielle-Charlotte Reju (1856\u20131920), a  French actress at the start of the 20th century. [[Escoffier]] named several dishes for her, including consomm\u00e9, sole, and \u0153ufs \u00e0 la neige.\n* [[Reuben sandwich]] \u2013 possibly [[Reuben Kolakofsky]] (1874\u20131960) made it for a poker group gathered at his restaurant in an Omaha, Nebraska [[Blackstone Hotel|hotel]] c. 1925, or [[Arnold Reuben]], a New York restaurateur (1883\u20131970), may have created and named it c. 1914.\n* [[Rigo Jancsi|Rig\u00f3 Jancsi]] \u2013 the Viennese chocolate and cream pastry<ref name=\"Gundel 1992\">{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 130</ref> is named after the Gypsy violinist, [[Rigo Jancsi|Rig\u00f3 Jancsi]]<ref name=\"Gundel 1992\"/> (by Hungarian use, Rig\u00f3 is his last name, Jancsi his first, called literally 'Blackbird Johnny'). He is perhaps best known for his part in one of the great late-19th-century society ''scandales''. In 1896, [[Clara Ward, Princesse de Caraman-Chimay]]. The Princesse de Chimay saw the charming Rig\u00f3 Jancsi, first violinist playing [[N\u00f3ta|Hungarian Gypsy music]] in a Paris restaurant in 1896 while dining with her husband, [[Prince de Chimay]]. She ran off with Rig\u00f3, married him, divorced him, and later married two other men too.\n* [[Robert E. Lee Cake]] \u2013 southern U.S. lemon layer cake named for [[American Civil War]] General [[Robert E. Lee]] (1807\u20131870).\n* [[Strawberries Romanoff]] \u2013 although there are a number of claimants for the creation of this dish, including the Hollywood restaurateur self-styled \"[[Michael Romanoff|Prince Michael Romanoff]]\", credit is most often given to [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]], when he was chef to tzar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] around 1820. [[Romanoff]] was the house name of the Russian rulers.\n* [[Ronald Reagan's Hamburger Soup]] \u2013 [[Ronald Reagan]], while President, had this recipe issued publicly in 1986, after he had gotten flak for saying he liked French soups.<ref name=\"Skidelsky 2012\"/>\n* [[Ross Sauce]] \u2013 a multipurpose barbecue sauce invented by Scott Ross in Habersham County, Georgia. Scott Ross, a high school chemistry teacher and wrestling coach, says that his sauce \"goes great on anything\" suggesting salad, popcorn, and almost anything but meats.\n* [[Tournedos Rossini]] \u2013 [[Gioacchino Rossini]] (1792\u20131868), Italian composer known almost as well as a gastronome. A friend of [[Car\u00eame]], [[Prince Metternich]], et al., Rossini had many dishes named for him: eggs, chicken, soup, salad, cannelloni, sole, risotto, pheasant, and more. [[Escoffier]] was responsible for many of these. Charles Ranhofer created \"Meringued pancakes \u00e0 la Rossini.\"\n* [[Souffl\u00e9 Rothschild]] \u2013 a dessert souffl\u00e9 created by [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] for Baron [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792\u20131868) and Baroness [[Betty de Rothschild]] (1805\u20131886) in the 1820s. The Baron was a notable French banker and diplomat. It was originally flavoured with [[Goldwasser]] but is now flavoured with a variety of other liqueurs and spirits including [[Kirschwasser|kirsch]]. This dessert was a favourite of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] (1900\u20132002).\n* [[Rumford's Soup]] \u2013 [[Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]]\n* [[Runeberg torte]] (''Runebergintorttu / Runebergst\u00e5rta'') \u2013 named after the Finnish poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] (1804\u20131877) and his wife, writer [[Fredrika Runeberg]] (1807\u20131879), who invented the pastry. Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday, 5 February, is in Finland Runeberg-day and it is celebrated with this almond-pastry. There is also a variation of this called the Fredrika-pastry.\n* [[Baby Ruth]] candy bar \u2013 most likely, [[Babe Ruth]] (1895\u20131948) was the inspiration for the name. Although the Curtiss Candy Co. has insisted from the beginning that the candy bar was named after a daughter of [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Ruth Cleveland]] died in 1904 at the age of 12, while the Baby Ruth was introduced in 1921 right at a time when George Herman Ruth, Jr. had become a baseball superstar. Very early versions of the wrapper offer a baseball glove for 79 cents. Babe Ruth's announced intent to sue the company is probably what drove and perpetuated the dubious cover story.\n\n== S ==\n[[File:Beef Stroganoff on Pasta.jpg|thumb|[[Beef Stroganoff]] served atop pasta]]\n* [[Sachertorte]] \u2013 [[Franz Sacher]], Vienna, 1832, working for [[Prince Metternich]].\n* [[Chicken filets Sadi Carnot]] \u2013 chef Charles Ranhofer almost certainly had French President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot]] (1837\u20131894) in mind, not his uncle, the physicist [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] (1796\u20131832).\n* [[Flan Sagan]] \u2013 see [[Talleyrand]] below. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]]-P\u00e9rigord held the title of Prince of [[\u017baga\u0144]]. This flan of truffles, mushrooms, and calves' brains was one of several Sagan-named dishes, usually involving brains, including a garnish and scrambled eggs.\n* [[Salisbury steak]] \u2013 [[Dr. James H. Salisbury]] (1823\u20131905), early U.S. health food advocate, created this dish and advised his patients to eat it three times a day, while limiting their intake of \"poisonous\" vegetables and starches.\n* [[Beef hash Sam Ward]] \u2013 [[Samuel Cutler Ward]] (1814\u20131884) was perhaps the most influential Washington lobbyist of the mid-19th century. He was as well known for his entertaining as his political work, apparently agreeing with Talleyrand that dining well was essential to diplomacy. Why Ranhofer named a beef hash after him is open to speculation.\n* [[Sandwich]] \u2013 [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]] (1718\u20131792) did not invent the sandwich. Meat between slices of bread had been eaten long before him. But as the often-repeated story goes, his title name was applied to it c. 1762, after he frequently called for the easily handled food while entertaining friends. Their card games then were not interrupted by the need for forks and such.\n* [[Sarah Bernhardt Cakes]] \u2013 French actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] (1844\u20131923). The pastry may be Danish in origin. There is a Sole Sarah Bernhardt, and a [[souffl\u00e9]]. \"Sarah Bernhardt\" may indicate a dish garnished with a pur\u00e9e of foie gras, and Delmonico's \"Sarah Potatoes\", by Charles Ranhofer, are most likely named for the actress.\n* [[Eggs Sardou]] \u2013 Invented at the New Orleans restaurant [[Antoine's]] and named after the French dramatist [[Victorien Sardou]]\n* [[Schillerlocken]] \u2013 two quite distinct foods named after the curly hair of the German poet [[Friedrich von Schiller]] (1759\u20131805). One is cream-filled puff pastry cornets; the other is long strips of smoked [[Squalidae|dogfish]] belly flaps. Ranhofer named a dessert of pancakes rolled up, sliced, and layered in a mold [[Schiller pudding]].\n* [[Seckel pear]] \u2013 although little is known about the origin of this American pear, it is generally believed that a Pennsylvania farmer named [[Seckel]] discovered the fruit in the Delaware River Valley near Philadelphia, in the 18th or early 19th century.\n* [[Lobster cutlets \u00e0 la Shelley]] \u2013 [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792\u20131822), the great English poet, drowned off the coast of Italy. Charles Ranhofer remembered him with this.\n* [[Shirley Temple cocktail|Shirley Temple]] \u2013 the classic children's cocktail of club soda, [[grenadine]], and a maraschino cherry was invented in the late 1930s at Hollywood's [[Chasen's]] restaurant for the child star [[Shirley Temple]] (1928\u20132014). A slice of orange and a straw is suggested; the paper parasol is optional.\n* [[Reinette Simirenko]] \u2013 an apple variety discovered by Ukrainian pomologist Lev Simirenko in his garden and named after his father Platon Simirenko. The origin of this cultivar is unclear. It was one of the most widely grown apple varieties in the Soviet Union.\n* [[Veal Sinatra]] \u2013 a veal stuffed with a buttery cream sauce, vegetables, meat and/or seafood named after the famous jazz singer [[Frank Sinatra]]\n* [[Soubise sauce]] \u2013 the onion pur\u00e9e or b\u00e9chamel sauce with added onion pur\u00e9e is probably named after the 18th-century aristocrat [[Charles de Rohan]], Prince de Soubise, and Marshal of France.\n* [[Eggs Stanley]] \u2013 [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]] (1841\u20131904), the famed British explorer, has several dishes named for him, usually with onions and a small amount of curry seasoning. A recipe for these poached eggs has a sauce with 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder.\n* [[Beef Stroganoff]] \u2013 a 19th-century Russian dish, named for a [[Count Stroganov]] (possibly Count [[Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov]] or Count [[Grigory Dmitriyevich Stroganov]])\n* [[Sukjunamul]] \u2013 [[Shin Suk-ju]]\n* [[Crepes Suzette]] \u2013 said to have been created for then-Prince of Wales [[Edward VII]] on 31 January 1896, at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in [[Monte Carlo]]. When the prince ordered a special dessert for himself and a young female companion, [[Henri Charpentier]], then 16 (1880\u20131961), produced the flaming crepe dish. Edward reportedly asked that the dessert be named after his companion (Suzette) rather than himself. However, [[Larousse Gastronomique|Larousse]] disputes Charpentier's claim.\n* [[Ellen Svinhufvud cake]] \u2013 named in 1930s after [[Ellen Svinhufvud]] (1869\u20131953), the wife of President of Finland [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]]. \n* [[Sydney Smith's salad dressing]] \u2013 Salad dressing named after founder of the [[Edinburgh Review]], [[Sydney Smith]] (1771\u20131845). He was a clergyman who wrote a poem which describes how to make this salad. Popular in the 19th century among American cooks.\n\n== T ==\n[[File:Takuan.jpg|thumb|[[Takuan]]]]\n[[File:General Tso's Chicken.JPG|thumb|[[General Tso's chicken]]]]\n* [[Takuan]] \u2013 named after [[Takuan S\u014dh\u014d]], it is pickled [[daikon|daikon radish]]\n* [[Talleyrand]] \u2013 a pineapple [[savarin cake|savarin]] is one of many dishes named for the epicurean French statesman Charles Maurice de [[Talleyrand]]-P\u00e9rigord (1754\u20131838). An influential negotiator at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Talleyrand considered dining a major part of [[diplomacy]]. Antonin C\u00e2reme worked for him for a time, and Talleyrand was instrumental in furthering his career.

When he returned to the U.S. in 1899, he kept his Paris home and contacts.\n* [[Washington Pie]] \u2013 [[George Washington]] (1732\u20131799), first U.S. president, has this cake named after him, as well as a French sauce or garnish containing corn.\n* [[Beef Wellington]] \u2013 [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (1769\u20131852), British hero of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], has this dish of beef with p\u00e2t\u00e9, mushrooms, truffles and Madeira sauce, all encased in a pastry crust, named after him.
