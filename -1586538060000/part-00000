Barbara Gordon) is always looking for opportunities to try out her newest crime-fighting gadgets.\n\nBatgirl used to operate in Gotham City, where she craved for replacing Robin as Batman's partner, until her father James Gordon and herself had to move to Metropolis. Barbara started attending Metropolis High School, feeling very self-aware due to being the new transfer student, but she soon made friends who were also secretly superheroes. Barbara also got a job as a bartender at the \"Burrito Bucket\". Batgirl is the comedic relief out of all of her friends. She is known to be bubbly, cheerful, upbeat and downright optimistic. She is the one that wants everyone to get along and is often seen as the \"cheerleader\" in the group because of her contagious enthusiasm and zest for life. However, she is a fangirl and her ambitious nature makes her destined to be Batman's future sidekick. She is also a creative problem solver and will use her creativity and her surprisingly analytical thinking to stop the bad guys and be the glue in her friendships.\n\nThis version of the character is exclusive to the continuity of the television series ''DC Super Hero Girls'' and is an adaptation of Batgirl. The original character was created by Julius Schwartz, Gardner Fox, and Carmine Infantino and first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #359. Faust described Barbara Gordon as \"the Fangirl. Energetic.

Initially reluctant to become a Green Lantern, she actively refuses to hit anyone.

Karen Beecher) may lack the fighting skills of her super friends, but she has more heart and brainy resilience than anyone in Metropolis. She's always focusing her energy and engineering skills on upgrading her suit with the latest tech.\n\nKatana is a very strict and serious individual. With an intense character defined by a silent fierceness that matches Diana Prince's own. She is a fastidious sort whom takes discipline to heart. Feeling that an able mind is befitting of an apt body. Often taking the time to hone ones acumen as often as training the body. Tatsu is also extremely unforgiving towards the criminally corrupt. At one time believing it was a heroes duty to punish and avenge the crimes placated by the wicked. To the most extreme of degrees. This narrow mindset also made her a little naive, as Katana once mistook the Superhero Girls for villains after having dispatched most of metropolises criminals. This train of thought was further emboldened by the feeble means in which the reviled, decadent souls are handled by law enforcement.\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#c80815;\"|\n|-\n|{{anchor|Poison Ivy (character)}}[[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]|| [[Poison Ivy (character)|Pamela Lillian Isley]] || [[Tara Strong]]<br>[[Cristina Milizia]] || Homo planta || 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 || {{n/a}} || {{n/a}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"|\n'''{{vanchor|[[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]}}''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]] in the 2015 series; Cristina Milizia in the 2019 series) \u2013 A garden variety misfit, she gained her [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]-based abilities from an experiment gone awry.

After achieving a success with the hip hop group [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] and their album ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]'' (1995), Kim began working on her solo album with [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] serving as the executive producer (besides this, he performed on four songs). She collaborated with a number of producers, such as [[Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs]], [[Stevie J.]], [[Ski (record producer)|David \"Ski\" Willis]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]], among others. Other rappers, including [[Jay Z]], [[Lil' Cease]] and [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] were featured on the album.\n\nThe album was notable for its overt raunchy sexual tone and Kim's lyrical delivery, which was praised by music critics and is considered a classic album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Cummings |first=Jozen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 |title=Crime Doesn't Pay |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=14 |issue=5 |date=May 2006 |page=56 |issn=1070-4701 |accessdate=August 22, 2014 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote=With scanty clothing and the cachet that comes with having what many consider a classic album, ''Hard Core'', Lil' Kim was one of the few female rappers whose consistent platinum sales showed that she could play with the big boys.}}</ref> ''Hard Core'' debuted at number 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number three on the ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B Albums]], selling 78,000 copies in its first week, while reaching number 26 of the [[Canadian Albums Chart]].

After achieving a success with the hip hop group [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] and their album ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]'' (1995), Kim began working on her solo album with [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] serving as the executive producer (besides this, he performed on four songs). She collaborated with a number of producers, such as [[Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs]], [[Stevie J.]], [[Ski (record producer)|David \"Ski\" Willis]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]], among others. Other rappers, including [[Jay Z]], [[Lil' Cease]] and [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] were featured on the album.\n\nThe album was notable for its overt raunchy sexual tone and Kim's lyrical delivery, which was praised by music critics and is considered a classic album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Cummings |first=Jozen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 |title=Crime Doesn't Pay |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=14 |issue=5 |date=May 2006 |page=56 |issn=1070-4701 |accessdate=August 22, 2014 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote=With scanty clothing and the cachet that comes with having what many consider a classic album, ''Hard Core'', Lil' Kim was one of the few female rappers whose consistent platinum sales showed that she could play with the big boys.}}</ref> ''Hard Core'' debuted at number 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number three on the ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B Albums]], selling 78,000 copies in its first week, while reaching number 26 of the [[Canadian Albums Chart]].

I don't want dick tonight/Eat my pussy right\" (\"Not Tonight\"). Riding the wing of Notorious B.I.G.'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'' and [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', Kim's ''Hard Core'' helped put East Coast hip-hop back on top in the late '90s.

It shares the title of the 'highest [[market town]] in England', at about {{convert|1,000|ft|m}} above sea level, with [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]]. Despite being at such an altitude and in a remote location, the town is easily accessible via the many roads which link the town to [[Weardale]] valley, [[Teesdale]], Hartside Pass (and towns in Cumbria such as [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]) as well as the Tyne valley. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Cumberland]], Alston lies within the [[North Pennines]], a designated [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and is surrounded by beautiful views of the surrounding fells and the South Tyne Valley.

On 18 May 2013 very heavy rain resulted in flooding in seven areas of Alston, affecting thirty six properties. The Environment Agency records indicate that 51mm of rain fell that day.<ref>Cumbria County Council 'Alston Flood Investigation Report no 81' Draft 16.7.2014 (available in Alston Library)</ref>\n\nThe landscape of the area is built up from [[limestone]], [[sandstone]] and [[shale]].

Excavated in 1935, the barrows were dated between 2000 [[Before Christ|BC]] and 1700 BC.\n\nEvidence of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] activity in the area comes from the earth ramparts of [[Whitley Castle]], thought to be the Roman fort ([[Castra]]) of Epiacum<ref>{{cite web|author=Togodumnus (Kevan White) |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/epiacum.htm |title=Epiacvm |publisher=Roman-britain.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701021622/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/epiacum.htm |archivedate=1 July 2012 }}</ref> built and rebuilt by the [[List of Roman legions|Sixth and Twentieth Legions]] between the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The fort lies on the [[Maiden Way]] [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] which runs north from [[Kirkby Thore]] ([[Bravoniacum]]) to [[Carvoran]] ([[Magnae Carvetiorum|Magnae]]) on [[Hadrian's Wall]]. Whitley Castle would have guarded this central supply route to Hadrian's Wall, and may also have helped protect lead and [[silver]] deposits in the upper reaches of the South Tyne valley.\n\nThe name of the town is recorded in 1164-71 as Aldeneby and in 1209 as Aldeneston,<ref>Mills, David. A Dictionary of British Place-Names. OUP Oxford. 2011.</ref> and seems to mean \"the settlement or farmstead belonging to [a Viking man named] [[Halfdan]]\".\n\n===Sovereignty===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nIn the 10th century, [[Alston Moor]] was part of the Liberty of [[Tynedale]], which was an estate of the [[List of monarchs of Scotland|Scottish Kings]] within England, a situation that resulted in many years of confusion over the sovereignty of the area.\n\nIn 1085, the Barons de [[Vieuxpont|Veteriponte]] became the first recorded [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]]; they held the moor on behalf of the kings of [[Scotland]] while the kings of England retained the [[mineral rights]]. This was confirmed in a hearing during 1279 that concluded that the miners of the area were distinct from the local population, thus paying their dues to the English crown instead of to Scotland. As a result, the miners lived in their own self-regulated communities under English protection.\n\nIn 1296 [[John of Scotland|John de Balliol]], the king of Scotland, invaded the [[Northern England|North of England]]; as a result [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] moved to reclaim the Scottish estates and Tynedale, which included Alston Moor, was taken under direct control of the English crown where it remains.\n\nDespite the town being on the Tyne and being historically part of Tynedale, the area has never been part of either [[Hexhamshire]] or [[Northumberland]] but part of [[Cumberland]] and later [[Cumbria]]. This was probably because the mines in the area were at one time administered from Carlisle.\n\n===Mining===\nHistorically the area has been mined for lead, silver, [[zinc]], [[coal]] and [[Fluorite|fluorspar]]. The nearby Roman fort of [[Whitley Castle]] (Epiacum) may in part have been sited to control and protect the lead mines there.\n\nIn the 13th century, the area was known as the [[silver mine]]s of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]&mdash;silver was found in a high proportion (up to 40 [[Troy weight|troy ounce]]s per [[long ton]] or 1.2 g/kg of [[Smelting|smelted]] lead) and was used to create coinage in the [[Royal Mint]] established in Carlisle for the purpose. Most mining was very small scale until the mid-18th century,\n\nThe biggest mine owner in the area was the [[London Lead Company]]; this [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) organisation with enlightened employment policies established an interest in the area during the early 18th century. In 1745, it began construction of a school, a library, a sanitary house, a surgeon's house, a market hall with clock tower, a laundry and a 'ready-money' shop in [[Nenthead]], four miles away.\n\nMany of the last mines closed in the 1950s. A small drift coal mine ([[Ayle]] Colliery) was still active in 2013.\n\n==Governance==\nAlston is in the [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] of [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]]. [[Neil Hudson (politician)|Neil Hudson]] was elected its Conservative [[Member of Parliament]] at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]], replacing [[Rory Stewart]].\n\nPrior to [[Brexit]], for the [[European Parliament]] its residents voted to elect [[Members of the European Parliament|MEP]]'s for the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] constituency.\n\nFor [[Local Government]] purposes it is in the ''Alston Moor Ward'' of [[Eden District|Eden District Council]] and the ''Alston and East Fellside Division'' of [[Cumbria County Council]].\n\nAlston does not have its own [[Parish councils in England|parish council]], instead it is part of Alston Moor Parish Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alstonmoor.org/|title= Alston Moor Parish Council}}</ref>\n\n==Modern economy==\nThe area is no longer actively mined for precious metals although the mining history has been exploited for [[tourism]] purposes. There are few jobs in the immediate area, hence the fall in population from 6,858 in 1841 to around 1,200 today.\n\n===Farming===\nThe surrounding [[moorland]] is mainly used for sheep farming; however many farmers also have other enterprises, such as [[bed and breakfast]] accommodation. During winter months farming can be tough, due to the severe weather in the area.\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is now an important source of income for the area. The largest attraction is a narrow-gauge railway and heritage centre at  [[South Tynedale Railway]]. Alston and the surrounding area is part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and European Geopark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northpennines.org.uk |title=North Pennines |publisher=Northpennines.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> Alston is noted for its cobbled streets and 17th-century stone buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecumbriadirectory.com/Town_or_Village/location.php?url=alston |title=Alston, Cumbria |publisher=Thecumbriadirectory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> The area's mining heritage has been referenced for tourism purposes across the [[North Pennines]]. Nenthead Mines, at the nearby village of [[Nenthead]], is a [[Scheduled Monument]] managed by volunteers. The Nenthead Mines Conservation Society hold regular open days where visitors can learn about the history of lead mining and take an underground tour of Carrs Mine. The [[Pennine Way]], the UK's first [[National Trail]], passes by the edge of Alston and the [[Sea to Sea Cycle Route]] (C2C) passes through the town.\n\n===Shops and facilities===\nShops include a [[whole foods]] shop, a [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op supermarket]], a [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]] convenience store,  a shop selling [[Household hardware|hardware]], a post office, an outdoor clothing shop, an organic [[bakery]], a charity shop and a number of [[craft]], gift and [[antique shop]]s.\n\nThere are a four remaining public houses in Alston: the Cumberland Inn, the Turk's Head, the Victoria Inn and the Angel Inn.\n\nThe town also has a number of caf\u00e9s, a fish and chip shop, two hotels, numerous B&B's, two petrol stations, a gym, an estate agent and a hairdressers.\n\nThe last remaining bank, [[Barclays]], announced that it was going to close in December 2015, leaving the town with no bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/Alstons-last-bank-to-close |title=Alston's last Bank to close |publisher=Hexham Courant |date=28 July 2015 |access-date=29 July 2015 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> John McFarlane, the new Executive Chairman of Barclays, says \u201cI would slow down bank closures rather than accelerating them.

The closure of this foundry increased unemployment in the area from 8.9% to over 25%.\n\nCurrently the area's main employer is Bonds Precision Castings Limited, a company that took over Precision Products in 2008. Precision Products was started in 1947 by William George Ball. Bonds Precision Casting Ltd. produces [[stainless steel]] and super-alloy castings.\n\n==Population==\nThe population census figures show that at its peak during 1831 the population of the parish of [[Alston Moor]] was 6,858 people. Today that figure is about 1,200. The population of the town of Alston was 1,128 according to the 2001 Census.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  The community has its own website which is a result of the Cybermoor Project (cybermoor.org), which has brought the [[Internet]] to almost every home on Alston Moor, and [[broadband]] to many.

It also contains the [[Visitor centre|tourist information centre]], the [[public library]] and some local administration offices. Until the late 1980s the town hall also contained a branch of the [[Trustee Savings Bank]]. The bank closed down but the library moved to premises in the Market Place, then moved back to the town hall in September 2008. Construction of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] building started in 1857 when the local metallurgist and businessman [[Hugh Lee Pattinson]] laid the foundation stone. The architecture was designed by A.B. Higham and the estimated costs were \u00a32,000, although the final costs were closer to \u00a33,000; these were paid for by public subscription.<ref>[http://www.curlewconsulting.co.uk/historyline/26_townhall.mp3]</ref>\n\n===Market cross===\nAlthough the town does not hold a regular [[market (place)|market]] it still maintains the legal right to do so. The [[market cross]], which acts as a focal point in the centre of town, was constructed in 1981 to replace one which was demolished by a wagon in January 1980. That earlier cross had itself replaced a cross of 1883 which was knocked down by a lorry in 1968.<ref>Wilkinson. Peter (2009)</ref>\n\nA regular producers' market now takes place in the town hall from April to September selling food and crafts produced in [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham]], celebrating Alston's position at the crux of these three counties.\n\n===St Augustine of Canterbury Church===\n[[File:St Augustine of Canterbury church Alston.JPG|thumb|Parish Church of [[St Augustine of Canterbury]], Alston, February 2014]]\nThe parish church was built in 1869 on the site of two earlier churches.<ref>St Augustine of Canterbury Alston: A history of the parish church (2007)</ref> The church spire was only completed in 1886. A unique item in the church is a clock which belonged to [[James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater]], who was beheaded for treason. It is believed to be of 16th-century origin, and was restored in 1978.\nOne of the church bells which was cast in 1714 also belonged to the Earl of Derwentwater. It was installed in the previous church of 1770. Four of the bells were installed in memory of Andrew Graham Stewart Steele, churchwarden from 1943 until his murder in the [[Midland Bank]] on 13 September 1949. The bells cannot be pealed as the tower is not strong enough, but they are struck by a clapper.\n\n===Nent Force level===\nDuring the area's peak of prosperity in 1776 [[John Smeaton]] began construction of an underground drain (the ''\"Nent Force Level\"'') to de-water the mines of the Nent Valley and assist with the transport of extracted materials as well as to locate new mineral seams. The canal took 66 years to construct at a cost of \u00a380,000, and became known as \"Smeaton's Folly\". In the 1830s mine manager and engineer said that it could be visited \"in boats 30 feet in length, which are propelled in four feet of water by means of sticks projecting from the sides of the level; and thus may be enjoyed the singular novelty of sailing a few miles underground\". It was intended to be 9 feet square but in the softer terrain was extended to 9'\u00d716', dead level for {{convert|3+3/4|mi|km}} to allow boat use, with a rise of 35 [[fathom]]s ({{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Lovelady Shield and then driven into the [[Nenthead]] ground. The amount of ore found was disappointing, though not insignificant.\n\nAccess to the Nent Force Level is currently extremely difficult although efforts have been made to develop a [[heritage centre]] to make this extraordinary piece of engineering accessible to the public.\n\n===Samuel King's School===\nAs well as having a [[primary school]], the town is host to England's smallest [[secondary school]] (an 11&ndash;16 [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]]), [[Samuel King's School]]. Samuel King's serves the local communities such as Nenthead and Garrigill. Alston Moor has a second small primary school at Nenthead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelkings.cumbria.sch.uk |title=index |publisher=Samuelkings.cumbria.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==Alston in the media==\n\n===Filming locations===\nFront Street and the Market Cross of the town were used as filming locations in an adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (1997 film)|Jane Eyre]]''.

The town's [[Alston Line|rail link]] to Haltwhistle was completed in 1852 by the [[Newcastle and Carlisle Railway]] Company. The closure of the line was decided in the [[Beeching Report]] in 1962, but closure was rejected due to lack of a direct road link. After a road was built, closure was again proposed in 1973 and the line closed on 1 May 1976. It was the last enacted closures of the Beeching Report (another being the [[Bridport Railway|Bridport branch line]] from [[Bridport]] to [[Maiden Newton]] in [[Dorset]] which closed in 1975).\n\nPart of the route, between Alston and Slaggyford, five miles in length, is now operated as the [[narrow gauge]] [[South Tynedale Railway]].

It shares the title of the 'highest [[market town]] in England', at about {{convert|1,000|ft|m}} above sea level, with [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]]. Despite being at such an altitude and in a remote location, the town is easily accessible via the many roads which link the town to [[Weardale]] valley, [[Teesdale]], Hartside Pass (and towns in Cumbria such as [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]) as well as the Tyne valley. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Cumberland]], Alston lies within the [[North Pennines]], a designated [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and is surrounded by beautiful views of the surrounding fells and the South Tyne Valley.

The fort lies on the [[Maiden Way]] [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] which runs north from [[Kirkby Thore]] ([[Bravoniacum]]) to [[Carvoran]] ([[Magnae Carvetiorum|Magnae]]) on [[Hadrian's Wall]]. Whitley Castle would have guarded this central supply route to Hadrian's Wall, and may also have helped protect lead and [[silver]] deposits in the upper reaches of the South Tyne valley.\n\nThe name of the town is recorded in 1164-71 as Aldeneby and in 1209 as Aldeneston,<ref>Mills, David. A Dictionary of British Place-Names. OUP Oxford. 2011.</ref> and seems to mean \"the settlement or farmstead belonging to [a Viking man named] [[Halfdan]]\".\n\n===Sovereignty===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nIn the 10th century, [[Alston Moor]] was part of the Liberty of [[Tynedale]], which was an estate of the [[List of monarchs of Scotland|Scottish Kings]] within England, a situation that resulted in many years of confusion over the sovereignty of the area.\n\nIn 1085, the Barons de [[Vieuxpont|Veteriponte]] became the first recorded [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]]; they held the moor on behalf of the kings of [[Scotland]] while the kings of England retained the [[mineral rights]]. This was confirmed in a hearing during 1279 that concluded that the miners of the area were distinct from the local population, thus paying their dues to the English crown instead of to Scotland. As a result, the miners lived in their own self-regulated communities under English protection.\n\nIn 1296 [[John of Scotland|John de Balliol]], the king of Scotland, invaded the [[Northern England|North of England]]; as a result [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] moved to reclaim the Scottish estates and Tynedale, which included Alston Moor, was taken under direct control of the English crown where it remains.\n\nDespite the town being on the Tyne and being historically part of Tynedale, the area has never been part of either [[Hexhamshire]] or [[Northumberland]] but part of [[Cumberland]] and later [[Cumbria]]. This was probably because the mines in the area were at one time administered from Carlisle.\n\n===Mining===\nHistorically the area has been mined for lead, silver, [[zinc]], [[coal]] and [[Fluorite|fluorspar]]. The nearby Roman fort of [[Whitley Castle]] (Epiacum) may in part have been sited to control and protect the lead mines there.\n\nIn the 13th century, the area was known as the [[silver mine]]s of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]&mdash;silver was found in a high proportion (up to 40 [[Troy weight|troy ounce]]s per [[long ton]] or 1.2 g/kg of [[Smelting|smelted]] lead) and was used to create coinage in the [[Royal Mint]] established in Carlisle for the purpose. Most mining was very small scale until the mid-18th century,\n\nThe biggest mine owner in the area was the [[London Lead Company]]; this [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) organisation with enlightened employment policies established an interest in the area during the early 18th century. In 1745, it began construction of a school, a library, a sanitary house, a surgeon's house, a market hall with clock tower, a laundry and a 'ready-money' shop in [[Nenthead]], four miles away.\n\nMany of the last mines closed in the 1950s. A small drift coal mine ([[Ayle]] Colliery) was still active in 2013.\n\n==Governance==\nAlston is in the [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] of [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]]. [[Neil Hudson (politician)|Neil Hudson]] was elected its Conservative [[Member of Parliament]] at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]], replacing [[Rory Stewart]].\n\nPrior to [[Brexit]], for the [[European Parliament]] its residents voted to elect [[Members of the European Parliament|MEP]]'s for the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] constituency.\n\nFor [[Local Government]] purposes it is in the ''Alston Moor Ward'' of [[Eden District|Eden District Council]] and the ''Alston and East Fellside Division'' of [[Cumbria County Council]].\n\nAlston does not have its own [[Parish councils in England|parish council]], instead it is part of Alston Moor Parish Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alstonmoor.org/|title= Alston Moor Parish Council}}</ref>\n\n==Modern economy==\nThe area is no longer actively mined for precious metals although the mining history has been exploited for [[tourism]] purposes. There are few jobs in the immediate area, hence the fall in population from 6,858 in 1841 to around 1,200 today.\n\n===Farming===\nThe surrounding [[moorland]] is mainly used for sheep farming; however many farmers also have other enterprises, such as [[bed and breakfast]] accommodation. During winter months farming can be tough, due to the severe weather in the area.\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is now an important source of income for the area. The largest attraction is a narrow-gauge railway and heritage centre at  [[South Tynedale Railway]]. Alston and the surrounding area is part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and European Geopark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northpennines.org.uk |title=North Pennines |publisher=Northpennines.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> Alston is noted for its cobbled streets and 17th-century stone buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecumbriadirectory.com/Town_or_Village/location.php?url=alston |title=Alston, Cumbria |publisher=Thecumbriadirectory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> The area's mining heritage has been referenced for tourism purposes across the [[North Pennines]]. Nenthead Mines, at the nearby village of [[Nenthead]], is a [[Scheduled Monument]] managed by volunteers. The Nenthead Mines Conservation Society hold regular open days where visitors can learn about the history of lead mining and take an underground tour of Carrs Mine. The [[Pennine Way]], the UK's first [[National Trail]], passes by the edge of Alston and the [[Sea to Sea Cycle Route]] (C2C) passes through the town.\n\n===Shops and facilities===\nShops include a [[whole foods]] shop, a [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op supermarket]], a [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]] convenience store,  a shop selling [[Household hardware|hardware]], a post office, an outdoor clothing shop, an organic [[bakery]], a charity shop and a number of [[craft]], gift and [[antique shop]]s.\n\nThere are a four remaining public houses in Alston: the Cumberland Inn, the Turk's Head, the Victoria Inn and the Angel Inn.\n\nThe town also has a number of caf\u00e9s, a fish and chip shop, two hotels, numerous B&B's, two petrol stations, a gym, an estate agent and a hairdressers.\n\nThe last remaining bank, [[Barclays]], announced that it was going to close in December 2015, leaving the town with no bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/Alstons-last-bank-to-close |title=Alston's last Bank to close |publisher=Hexham Courant |date=28 July 2015 |access-date=29 July 2015 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> John McFarlane, the new Executive Chairman of Barclays, says \u201cI would slow down bank closures rather than accelerating them.

The closure of this foundry increased unemployment in the area from 8.9% to over 25%.\n\nCurrently the area's main employer is Bonds Precision Castings Limited, a company that took over Precision Products in 2008. Precision Products was started in 1947 by William George Ball. Bonds Precision Casting Ltd. produces [[stainless steel]] and super-alloy castings.\n\n==Population==\nThe population census figures show that at its peak during 1831 the population of the parish of [[Alston Moor]] was 6,858 people. Today that figure is about 1,200. The population of the town of Alston was 1,128 according to the 2001 Census.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  The community has its own website which is a result of the Cybermoor Project (cybermoor.org), which has brought the [[Internet]] to almost every home on Alston Moor, and [[broadband]] to many.

It also contains the [[Visitor centre|tourist information centre]], the [[public library]] and some local administration offices. Until the late 1980s the town hall also contained a branch of the [[Trustee Savings Bank]]. The bank closed down but the library moved to premises in the Market Place, then moved back to the town hall in September 2008. Construction of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] building started in 1857 when the local metallurgist and businessman [[Hugh Lee Pattinson]] laid the foundation stone. The architecture was designed by A.B. Higham and the estimated costs were \u00a32,000, although the final costs were closer to \u00a33,000; these were paid for by public subscription.<ref>[http://www.curlewconsulting.co.uk/historyline/26_townhall.mp3]</ref>\n\n===Market cross===\nAlthough the town does not hold a regular [[market (place)|market]] it still maintains the legal right to do so. The [[market cross]], which acts as a focal point in the centre of town, was constructed in 1981 to replace one which was demolished by a wagon in January 1980. That earlier cross had itself replaced a cross of 1883 which was knocked down by a lorry in 1968.<ref>Wilkinson. Peter (2009)</ref>\n\nA regular producers' market now takes place in the town hall from April to September selling food and crafts produced in [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham]], celebrating Alston's position at the crux of these three counties.\n\n===St Augustine of Canterbury Church===\n[[File:St Augustine of Canterbury church Alston.JPG|thumb|Parish Church of [[St Augustine of Canterbury]], Alston, February 2014]]\nThe parish church was built in 1869 on the site of two earlier churches.<ref>St Augustine of Canterbury Alston: A history of the parish church (2007)</ref> The church spire was only completed in 1886. A unique item in the church is a clock which belonged to [[James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater]], who was beheaded for treason. It is believed to be of 16th-century origin, and was restored in 1978.\nOne of the church bells which was cast in 1714 also belonged to the Earl of Derwentwater. It was installed in the previous church of 1770. Four of the bells were installed in memory of Andrew Graham Stewart Steele, churchwarden from 1943 until his murder in the [[Midland Bank]] on 13 September 1949. The bells cannot be pealed as the tower is not strong enough, but they are struck by a clapper.\n\n===Nent Force level===\nDuring the area's peak of prosperity in 1776 [[John Smeaton]] began construction of an underground drain (the ''\"Nent Force Level\"'') to de-water the mines of the Nent Valley and assist with the transport of extracted materials as well as to locate new mineral seams. The canal took 66 years to construct at a cost of \u00a380,000, and became known as \"Smeaton's Folly\". In the 1830s mine manager and engineer said that it could be visited \"in boats 30 feet in length, which are propelled in four feet of water by means of sticks projecting from the sides of the level; and thus may be enjoyed the singular novelty of sailing a few miles underground\". It was intended to be 9 feet square but in the softer terrain was extended to 9'\u00d716', dead level for {{convert|3+3/4|mi|km}} to allow boat use, with a rise of 35 [[fathom]]s ({{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Lovelady Shield and then driven into the [[Nenthead]] ground. The amount of ore found was disappointing, though not insignificant.\n\nAccess to the Nent Force Level is currently extremely difficult although efforts have been made to develop a [[heritage centre]] to make this extraordinary piece of engineering accessible to the public.\n\n===Samuel King's School===\nAs well as having a [[primary school]], the town is host to England's smallest [[secondary school]] (an 11&ndash;16 [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]]), [[Samuel King's School]]. Samuel King's serves the local communities such as Nenthead and Garrigill. Alston Moor has a second small primary school at Nenthead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelkings.cumbria.sch.uk |title=index |publisher=Samuelkings.cumbria.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==Alston in the media==\n\n===Filming locations===\nFront Street and the Market Cross of the town were used as filming locations in an adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (1997 film)|Jane Eyre]]''.

The town's [[Alston Line|rail link]] to Haltwhistle was completed in 1852 by the [[Newcastle and Carlisle Railway]] Company. The closure of the line was decided in the [[Beeching Report]] in 1962, but closure was rejected due to lack of a direct road link. After a road was built, closure was again proposed in 1973 and the line closed on 1 May 1976. It was the last enacted closures of the Beeching Report (another being the [[Bridport Railway|Bridport branch line]] from [[Bridport]] to [[Maiden Newton]] in [[Dorset]] which closed in 1975).\n\nPart of the route, between Alston and Slaggyford, five miles in length, is now operated as the [[narrow gauge]] [[South Tynedale Railway]].
