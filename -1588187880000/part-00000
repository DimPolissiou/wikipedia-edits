Doug was introduced by executive producer [[Don Battye]] as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of \"a loving family\" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990.\n\nDoug was portrayed as a [[man's man]], down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being \"an easy touch\" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, [[Pam Willis|Pam]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]), he ended up having a [[one-night stand]] with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, [[Bert Willis|Bert]] ([[Bud Tingwell]]), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression.\n\nOne of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family.\n\n==Casting==\nFollowing a short stint in rival Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', Donovan joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' in 1990.<ref name=\"Pritchard\">{{cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Chris|date=February 1992|title=Jason couldn't have made it without me|journal=[[Woman's Own]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He was cast in the role of Doug, the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family.<ref name=\"Pritchard\"/> The family aspect was one of the main reasons Donovan accepted the part.

During a friend's [[bucks night]], Doug accepted a dare to travel across town in a taxi naked. The taxi driver turned out to be Pam Beresford, who Doug fell in love with. He and Pam married and had five children, four of whom survived. When Doug does some work on Number 28 Ramsay Street in preparation for a sale, he decides to purchase the house and the family move to Erinsborough. Doug becomes good friends with [[Joe Mangel]] ([[Mark Little (Australian actor)|Mark Little]]), [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and Jim Robinson, even though they get off to a bad start when Doug flirts with Jim's wife. When Doug's eldest son, Adam, quits medicine, Doug believes he can pass his construction business onto him. However, when he realises that Adam is not really into it, Doug makes his time on the site difficult, forcing Adam to go back to his studies. Doug goes into partnership with [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and they plan to build a retirement village in the bush. Councillor [[Felicity Brent]] (Rhona McLeod) threatens to vote against the development but fails and work begins. The project eventually collapses, leaving Doug and Paul in debt.\n\nDoug and Pam's financial troubles continue due to Cody's student exchange fees and them having to bail Brad out of jail. Just as they being thinking about selling the house, Gaby tricks one of Doug's debtors into paying up. Doug befriends [[Brenda Riley]] ([[Genevieve Lemon]]) and she falls in love with him. Brenda kisses Doug, which Gaby witnesses and she tells Pam. Doug explains that he is not having an affair and then tells Brenda that he never felt anything other than friendship towards her. Doug's sister, Faye, comes to stay and Doug puts up with her because she is lonely. When Faye invites Doug's childhood sweetheart, Alexandra Lomax ([[Chantal Contouri]]), for a visit, Doug asks her to leave. Faye moves into Number 32 instead. Doug's photo appears in the local newspaper and it is spotted by Jill Weir. She befriends Doug and Pam, who support her in her custody battle for her son, Ross. When Ross dies, she relies on Doug and Pam. Doug realises that Jill is attracted to him but Pam fails to notice. When Doug assumes Pam and Jim are having an affair, he has a one-night stand with Jill. Doug immediately regrets it and tells Pam, who throws him out and files for divorce. However, when Doug and Brad are lost at sea, Pam realises how much she loves him and they reconcile.\n\nWhen Gaby is almost raped by [[Simon Hunter]] (Frederick Whitlock), Doug tracks him down and hits him. Simon threatens to sue Doug for assault if Gaby reports him to the police, so she is forced to drop the matter. Doug's father, Bert, turns up after Gaby reveals that she has been writing to him. Bert tries to make amends with his son but Doug refuses to forgive him. When Doug learns Bert is dying, he decides to make peace with him. Doug is given the contract to rebuild the Waterhole but before work can begin his company is audited and discovered to be in debt to the tax department, leaving Doug no choice but to sell it to Constructocon. The company keep Doug on but he is eventually fired. Doug sinks into a deep depression and begins drinking. Things begin to improve when Doug finds a job as a sales representative for a building supplier. Doug and Pam learn that they actually paid the money they were supposed to have owed to the tax department and receive a refund. Doug uses the money to buy a house to do up and he sells it to the council, who ask him to do further renovations to the property. Doug finds himself in trouble with [[Andrew MacKenzie (Neighbours)|Andrew \"Macca\" MacKenzie]] (John Morris) when he and Lou begin brewing their own beer in the shed at the property but Macca eventually joins them.\n\nGaby gives birth to a son, [[Zac Willis|Zac]] (Jay Callahan), who is named after Doug's grandfather and she leaves to run a hotel in Darwin. A few weeks later, she contacts Doug and offers him some building work on the hotel. Doug and Pam decide to sell up and they leave Erinsborough. Cody stays behind to continue her studies. A year later, Cody is shot and Pam returns to be with her, while Doug stays behind as he is the middle of a big building contract. When Cody comes round, Doug speaks with her on the phone. However, Cody takes a turn for the worse and dies. Pam takes her body back to Darwin where she and Doug bury her. In July 2005, [[Annalise Hartman]] ([[Kimberley Davies]]) invites Doug to attend a screening of her documentary about Ramsay Street. Doug returns with [[Philip Martin (Neighbours)|Philip Martin]] ([[Ian Rawlings]]) and they sneak into Number 22 and paint a beard onto a sleeping Lou's face. After watching the documentary, Lou joins Doug and Philip on a fishing trip up north.\n\nIn April 2014, Doug comes to visit Brad and his family on Ramsay Street. Doug also wants to teach his grandson, Josh, the basics of the building trade. Doug catches up with Lou and they decide to start making some of their home brew. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) hires Doug to cover for her grandson at his yard, and he accepts. Brad's wife, [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), suspects Doug prefers Beth to her but Doug assures Brad that it is not the case. Terese later notices that Doug appears to be forgetting things but Brad puts it down to old age. Josh also becomes concerned when Doug messes up a couple of jobs, leaves the yard unattended and gives [[Imogen Willis|Imogen]] (Ariel Kaplan) alcoholic ginger beer by mistake. When Doug stays out all night, he is found injured and talking about meeting Cody. Josh accompanies Doug to the hospital and tests show Doug has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Pam comes down to see Doug and does not initially believe the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, thinking that Doug has been having an affair. She is convinced of Doug's illness and vows to stand by her husband. Brad and Terese asks Pam and Doug to move in with them but Pam and Doug reject the offer to go travelling.\n\nDoug returns a few months later to support Josh ahead of his court case for punching [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason). Josh takes Doug to the park to play cricket, so he has positive memories of him in case he is sent to jail. Doug meets his granddaughter [[Paige Smith|Paige]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) for the first time. He mentions that Brad and Lauren might have stayed together if they had known that Paige was alive but realises he has made a mistake and apologises for upsetting Terese. Doug later gifts Paige an ankle bracelet to welcome her to the family. Doug briefly goes missing and is found in Number 28, his old home. He later teaches Josh and Paige some woodwork skills. When Doug learns Imogen is not attending her school formal, he organises a family formal for her instead. He tells her she can call him anytime, before he leaves for Darwin the next day. The following year, Doug returns to meet Josh's newborn daughter Matilda and stay with his family for Christmas. He gives Paige a commitment ring to give to her boyfriend [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]). Doug runs Paul's car off the road, causing him and his passenger [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) to crash. Josh realises what Doug did and tries to protect him. Steph agrees not to report Doug to the police if he agrees to stop driving. Doug and Lou team up to get Josh and [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow) talking about their daughter's future. Doug announces that he is going home and laments that it might be the last time he remembers who everyone is. He pays a visit to Lou, before leaving for Darwin. After Doug accidentally sets fire to his house, Pam decides she can no longer take care of him. Brad and Lauren offer to let Doug move in with them but Doug disapproves of Brad and Lauren's relationship and is rude to Lauren. He goes to see Terese and she calms him down, before encouraging him to accept Brad and Lauren's relationship, and he apologises to them. Paul convinces Doug to invest in his plan to renovate a run-down motel. Doug goes for a drive with Susan during a heatwave. The car breaks down because Doug put water in the oil. Doug walks away and Susan collapses with heatstroke. Imogen later finds Susan, who is taken to hospital. Doug's condition continues to deteriorate and his family consider putting him in a nursing home but decide to hire [[Nene Williams]] ([[Ally Fowler]]) to care for him. However, she manipulates his condition to gain attention from Karl Kennedy and is fired. Nene apologises to Doug. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Doug goes missing. His grandson, Ned, finds him in his hotel room and it emerges Doug brought Ned to Erinsborough to see Brad. Shortly after they are reunited, Doug collapses. Karl is unable to revive him and he pronounces him dead.\n\n==Reception==\nA writer for the BBC's official ''Neighbours'' website stated that Doug's most notable moment was \"Having an affair with Jill Weir.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content/_dougwillis/page1|title=Character: Doug Willis|publisher=[[BBC]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031007040204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content%2F_dougwillis%2Fpage1|archivedate=7 October 2003|accessdate=15 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Haywood commented that Doug was \"the more likeable part\" compared to Donovan's character, [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]], in ''Home and Away''.<ref>[[#refhaywood|Haywood 1991]], p.163.</ref> Monroe branded Doug \"warm-hearted and friendly\" and thought that he and Paul made \"an odd couple in business\".<ref>[[#refmonroe2|Monroe 1994]], p.113.</ref> Wanda Jamrozick, writing for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', called Donovan's performance as Doug \"a dominating presence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=Terry+Donovan+and+doug&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news920225_0103_9435|title=Today's people|last=Jamrozick|first=Wanda|date=25 February 1992|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring her feature on ''Neighbours'', Anna Pickard from ''[[The Guardian]]'' tried to choose the characters she would be most starstruck by if she met them.

Doug was introduced by executive producer [[Don Battye]] as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of \"a loving family\" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990.\n\nDoug was portrayed as a [[man's man]], down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being \"an easy touch\" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, [[Pam Willis|Pam]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]), he ended up having a [[one-night stand]] with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, [[Bert Willis|Bert]] ([[Bud Tingwell]]), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression.\n\nOne of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family.\n\n==Casting==\nFollowing a short stint in rival Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', Donovan joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' in 1990.<ref name=\"Pritchard\">{{cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Chris|date=February 1992|title=Jason couldn't have made it without me|journal=[[Woman's Own]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He was cast in the role of Doug, the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family.<ref name=\"Pritchard\"/> The family aspect was one of the main reasons Donovan accepted the part.

During a friend's [[bucks night]], Doug accepted a dare to travel across town in a taxi naked. The taxi driver turned out to be Pam Beresford, who Doug fell in love with. He and Pam married and had five children, four of whom survived. When Doug does some work on Number 28 Ramsay Street in preparation for a sale, he decides to purchase the house and the family move to Erinsborough. Doug becomes good friends with [[Joe Mangel]] ([[Mark Little (Australian actor)|Mark Little]]), [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and Jim Robinson, even though they get off to a bad start when Doug flirts with Jim's wife. When Doug's eldest son, Adam, quits medicine, Doug believes he can pass his construction business onto him. However, when he realises that Adam is not really into it, Doug makes his time on the site difficult, forcing Adam to go back to his studies. Doug goes into partnership with [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and they plan to build a retirement village in the bush. Councillor [[Felicity Brent]] (Rhona McLeod) threatens to vote against the development but fails and work begins. The project eventually collapses, leaving Doug and Paul in debt.\n\nDoug and Pam's financial troubles continue due to Cody's student exchange fees and them having to bail Brad out of jail. Just as they being thinking about selling the house, Gaby tricks one of Doug's debtors into paying up. Doug befriends [[Brenda Riley]] ([[Genevieve Lemon]]) and she falls in love with him. Brenda kisses Doug, which Gaby witnesses and she tells Pam. Doug explains that he is not having an affair and then tells Brenda that he never felt anything other than friendship towards her. Doug's sister, Faye, comes to stay and Doug puts up with her because she is lonely. When Faye invites Doug's childhood sweetheart, Alexandra Lomax ([[Chantal Contouri]]), for a visit, Doug asks her to leave. Faye moves into Number 32 instead. Doug's photo appears in the local newspaper and it is spotted by Jill Weir. She befriends Doug and Pam, who support her in her custody battle for her son, Ross. When Ross dies, she relies on Doug and Pam. Doug realises that Jill is attracted to him but Pam fails to notice. When Doug assumes Pam and Jim are having an affair, he has a one-night stand with Jill. Doug immediately regrets it and tells Pam, who throws him out and files for divorce. However, when Doug and Brad are lost at sea, Pam realises how much she loves him and they reconcile.\n\nWhen Gaby is almost raped by [[Simon Hunter]] (Frederick Whitlock), Doug tracks him down and hits him. Simon threatens to sue Doug for assault if Gaby reports him to the police, so she is forced to drop the matter. Doug's father, Bert, turns up after Gaby reveals that she has been writing to him. Bert tries to make amends with his son but Doug refuses to forgive him. When Doug learns Bert is dying, he decides to make peace with him. Doug is given the contract to rebuild the Waterhole but before work can begin his company is audited and discovered to be in debt to the tax department, leaving Doug no choice but to sell it to Constructocon. The company keep Doug on but he is eventually fired. Doug sinks into a deep depression and begins drinking. Things begin to improve when Doug finds a job as a sales representative for a building supplier. Doug and Pam learn that they actually paid the money they were supposed to have owed to the tax department and receive a refund. Doug uses the money to buy a house to do up and he sells it to the council, who ask him to do further renovations to the property. Doug finds himself in trouble with [[Andrew MacKenzie (Neighbours)|Andrew \"Macca\" MacKenzie]] (John Morris) when he and Lou begin brewing their own beer in the shed at the property but Macca eventually joins them.\n\nGaby gives birth to a son, [[Zac Willis|Zac]] (Jay Callahan), who is named after Doug's grandfather and she leaves to run a hotel in Darwin. A few weeks later, she contacts Doug and offers him some building work on the hotel. Doug and Pam decide to sell up and they leave Erinsborough. Cody stays behind to continue her studies. A year later, Cody is shot and Pam returns to be with her, while Doug stays behind as he is the middle of a big building contract. When Cody comes round, Doug speaks with her on the phone. However, Cody takes a turn for the worse and dies. Pam takes her body back to Darwin where she and Doug bury her. In July 2005, [[Annalise Hartman]] ([[Kimberley Davies]]) invites Doug to attend a screening of her documentary about Ramsay Street. Doug returns with [[Philip Martin (Neighbours)|Philip Martin]] ([[Ian Rawlings]]) and they sneak into Number 22 and paint a beard onto a sleeping Lou's face. After watching the documentary, Lou joins Doug and Philip on a fishing trip up north.\n\nIn April 2014, Doug comes to visit Brad and his family on Ramsay Street. Doug also wants to teach his grandson, Josh, the basics of the building trade. Doug catches up with Lou and they decide to start making some of their home brew. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) hires Doug to cover for her grandson at his yard, and he accepts. Brad's wife, [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), suspects Doug prefers Beth to her but Doug assures Brad that it is not the case. Terese later notices that Doug appears to be forgetting things but Brad puts it down to old age. Josh also becomes concerned when Doug messes up a couple of jobs, leaves the yard unattended and gives [[Imogen Willis|Imogen]] (Ariel Kaplan) alcoholic ginger beer by mistake. When Doug stays out all night, he is found injured and talking about meeting Cody. Josh accompanies Doug to the hospital and tests show Doug has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Pam comes down to see Doug and does not initially believe the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, thinking that Doug has been having an affair. She is convinced of Doug's illness and vows to stand by her husband. Brad and Terese asks Pam and Doug to move in with them but Pam and Doug reject the offer to go travelling.\n\nDoug returns a few months later to support Josh ahead of his court case for punching [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason). Josh takes Doug to the park to play cricket, so he has positive memories of him in case he is sent to jail. Doug meets his granddaughter [[Paige Smith|Paige]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) for the first time. He mentions that Brad and Lauren (now played by [[Kate Kendall]]) might have stayed together if they had known that Paige was alive but realises he has made a mistake and apologises for upsetting Terese. Doug later gifts Paige an ankle bracelet to welcome her to the family. Doug briefly goes missing and is found in Number 28, his old home. He later teaches Josh and Paige some woodwork skills. When Doug learns Imogen is not attending her school formal, he organises a family formal for her instead. He tells her she can call him anytime, before he leaves for Darwin the next day. The following year, Doug returns to meet Josh's newborn daughter Matilda and stay with his family for Christmas. He gives Paige a commitment ring to give to her boyfriend [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]). Doug runs Paul's car off the road, causing him and his passenger [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) to crash. Josh realises what Doug did and tries to protect him. Steph agrees not to report Doug to the police if he agrees to stop driving. Doug and Lou team up to get Josh and [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow) talking about their daughter's future. Doug announces that he is going home and laments that it might be the last time he remembers who everyone is. He pays a visit to Lou, before leaving for Darwin. After Doug accidentally sets fire to his house, Pam decides she can no longer take care of him. Brad and Lauren offer to let Doug move in with them but Doug disapproves of Brad and Lauren's relationship and is rude to Lauren. He goes to see Terese and she calms him down, before encouraging him to accept Brad and Lauren's relationship, and he apologises to them. Paul convinces Doug to invest in his plan to renovate a run-down motel. Doug goes for a drive with Susan during a heatwave. The car breaks down because Doug put water in the oil. Doug walks away and Susan collapses with heatstroke. Imogen later finds Susan, who is taken to hospital. Doug's condition continues to deteriorate and his family consider putting him in a nursing home but decide to hire [[Nene Williams]] ([[Ally Fowler]]) to care for him. However, she manipulates his condition to gain attention from Karl Kennedy and is fired. Nene apologises to Doug. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Doug goes missing. His grandson, Ned, finds him in his hotel room and it emerges Doug brought Ned to Erinsborough to see Brad. Shortly after they are reunited, Doug collapses. Karl is unable to revive him and he pronounces him dead.\n\n==Reception==\nA writer for the BBC's official ''Neighbours'' website stated that Doug's most notable moment was \"Having an affair with Jill Weir.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content/_dougwillis/page1|title=Character: Doug Willis|publisher=[[BBC]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031007040204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content%2F_dougwillis%2Fpage1|archivedate=7 October 2003|accessdate=15 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Haywood commented that Doug was \"the more likeable part\" compared to Donovan's character, [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]], in ''Home and Away''.<ref>[[#refhaywood|Haywood 1991]], p.163.</ref> Monroe branded Doug \"warm-hearted and friendly\" and thought that he and Paul made \"an odd couple in business\".<ref>[[#refmonroe2|Monroe 1994]], p.113.</ref> Wanda Jamrozick, writing for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', called Donovan's performance as Doug \"a dominating presence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=Terry+Donovan+and+doug&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news920225_0103_9435|title=Today's people|last=Jamrozick|first=Wanda|date=25 February 1992|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring her feature on ''Neighbours'', Anna Pickard from ''[[The Guardian]]'' tried to choose the characters she would be most starstruck by if she met them.
