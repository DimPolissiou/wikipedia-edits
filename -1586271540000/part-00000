Kazan as being the one who first put the two plays together, although ''The Long Stay'' is a secondary plot arc.

BBC executive Anthony rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as the unhappiness among consumers unhappy with their own network bandwidth being consumed for transmitting content to other viewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49302215,00.htm|title=iPlayer uncovered: What powers the BBC's epic creation?|date=November 18, 2009}} CNet interview with iPlayer boss Anthony Rose, mostly on iPlayer 3.0</ref>\n\nSamsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.<ref>[http://www.twice.com/article/468711-Samsung_To_Do_3D_VOD_Streaming.php Samsung To Do 3D VOD Streaming], May 24, 2011</ref>\n===Access control===\nSome streaming services incorporate [[digital rights management]].  The [[W3C]] made the controversial decision to adopt [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] due in large part to motivations to provide [[copy protection]] for streaming content. [[Sky Go]] has software that is provided by [[Microsoft]] to prevent content being copied.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gibbs |first1=Samuel |title=Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that's better for work than play |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/06/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-thats-better-for-work-than-play |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=6 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, BBC iPlayer makes use of a parental control system giving parents the option to \"lock\" content, meaning that a password would have to be used to access it. The goal of these systems is to enable parents to keep children from viewing sexually-themed, violent, or otherwise inappropriate material. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===IPTV===\n{{main|IPTV}}\n[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s. About one in four new televisions being sold is now a smart TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Connected-TVs-Reach-One-Four-Homes/1009581|title=Connected TVs Reach One in Four Homes|date=January 3, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nConsidering the popularity of [[smart TV]]s and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the Internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as [[Netflix]]'s ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/house-cards-season-2-sees-surge-viewers-netflix-article-1.1617972 | title='House of Cards' season 2 sees surge of Netflix viewers over first season | work=NY Daily News | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2016 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}</ref> Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as [[Hulu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com|title=Watch TV and movies on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more - Hulu|work=Hulu}}</ref> Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the [[BBC]] utilizes their [[iPlayer]] format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that [[FIOS|Verizon]] is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon|title=Why Netflix streaming is getting slower, and probably won\u2019t get better any time soon|work=ExtremeTech}}</ref>\n\n[[Aereo]] was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aereo-broadcasters-streams-networks-tv_n_1690173.html |title=Aereo Threatens Broadcasters By Streaming Network TV Online |date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney| title=Supreme Court rules against Aereo| author=Stelter, Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/25/media/aereo-supreme-court-ruling/}}</ref>\n\n==Market competitors==\nMany providers of Internet television services exist\u2014including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as \"on-demand\" and \"catch-up\" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/itve/ Internet television platforms around the world] International TV Explorer</ref> Examples include the BBC, which introduced the [[BBC iPlayer]] on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its \"RadioPlayer\" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (\"4 on Demand\") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.\n\nSince 2012, around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-11092017|title=Parks Associates Announces 2017 Top 10 U.S. Subscription OTT Video Services|website=www.parksassociates.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Investment by [[Netflix]] in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/08/netflix-original-programming-13-billion/|title=Netflix Is Expected to Spend up to $13 Billion on Original Programming This Year|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\nBroadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!

[[BBC iPlayer]] makes use of the [[Adobe Flash Player]] to provide streaming-video clips and other software provided by Adobe for its download service. [[CNBC]], [[Bloomberg Television]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] use live-streaming services from [[BitGravity]] to stream live television to paid subscribers using the HTTP protocol.\n\nBBC iPlayer originally incorporated [[peer-to-peer]] streaming, moved towards centralized distribution for their video streaming services.  BBC executive Anthony rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as the unhappiness among consumers unhappy with their own network bandwidth being consumed for transmitting content to other viewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49302215,00.htm|title=iPlayer uncovered: What powers the BBC's epic creation?|date=November 18, 2009}} CNet interview with iPlayer boss Anthony Rose, mostly on iPlayer 3.0</ref>\n\nSamsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.<ref>[http://www.twice.com/article/468711-Samsung_To_Do_3D_VOD_Streaming.php Samsung To Do 3D VOD Streaming], May 24, 2011</ref>\n===Access control===\nSome streaming services incorporate [[digital rights management]].  The [[W3C]] made the controversial decision to adopt [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] due in large part to motivations to provide [[copy protection]] for streaming content. [[Sky Go]] has software that is provided by [[Microsoft]] to prevent content being copied.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gibbs |first1=Samuel |title=Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that's better for work than play |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/06/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-thats-better-for-work-than-play |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=6 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, BBC iPlayer makes use of a parental control system giving parents the option to \"lock\" content, meaning that a password would have to be used to access it. The goal of these systems is to enable parents to keep children from viewing sexually-themed, violent, or otherwise inappropriate material. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===IPTV===\n{{main|IPTV}}\n[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s. About one in four new televisions being sold is now a smart TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Connected-TVs-Reach-One-Four-Homes/1009581|title=Connected TVs Reach One in Four Homes|date=January 3, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nConsidering the popularity of [[smart TV]]s and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the Internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as [[Netflix]]'s ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/house-cards-season-2-sees-surge-viewers-netflix-article-1.1617972 | title='House of Cards' season 2 sees surge of Netflix viewers over first season | work=NY Daily News | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2016 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}</ref> Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as [[Hulu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com|title=Watch TV and movies on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more - Hulu|work=Hulu}}</ref> Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the [[BBC]] utilizes their [[iPlayer]] format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that [[FIOS|Verizon]] is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon|title=Why Netflix streaming is getting slower, and probably won\u2019t get better any time soon|work=ExtremeTech}}</ref>\n\n[[Aereo]] was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aereo-broadcasters-streams-networks-tv_n_1690173.html |title=Aereo Threatens Broadcasters By Streaming Network TV Online |date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney| title=Supreme Court rules against Aereo| author=Stelter, Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/25/media/aereo-supreme-court-ruling/}}</ref>\n\n==Market competitors==\nMany providers of Internet television services exist\u2014including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as \"on-demand\" and \"catch-up\" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/itve/ Internet television platforms around the world] International TV Explorer</ref> Examples include the BBC, which introduced the [[BBC iPlayer]] on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its \"RadioPlayer\" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (\"4 on Demand\") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.\n\nSince 2012, around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-11092017|title=Parks Associates Announces 2017 Top 10 U.S. Subscription OTT Video Services|website=www.parksassociates.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Investment by [[Netflix]] in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/08/netflix-original-programming-13-billion/|title=Netflix Is Expected to Spend up to $13 Billion on Original Programming This Year|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\nBroadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!

In 2003, those models were discontinued and the EX-351 and EX-50 were introduced. The EX-351 was discontinued in 2004 when the EX-400, EX-400BD, and the EX-260 were introduced. The EX-400BD was discontinued in 2007, therefore the EX-400, EX-260, and EX-50 are the only EX models currently produced by ESP in the LTD production line. The discontinued models are still sold online or in some guitar shops that still have them in stock.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:James Hetfield, Metallica @ Sonisphere.jpg| right | thumb | [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]] playing an ESP EXP guitar, with a design similar to that of [[Gibson Explorer]]]]\n[[File:DanJ-Atreyu.jpg| right | thumb | Dan Jacobs of [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]] playing an ESP EX guitar, with sharp edges]]\n\nThe EX series began as the MX Series in the mid to late 1980s, firstly producing a MX 220 based on a 1970s Gibson Explorer Body with the \u2018famed\u2019 banana headstock, then later with the MX 250 model (as shown in the pic above) with a smaller headstock and a 1980s Gibson body shape. Towards the late 1990s the range was renamed as ''EXP'' series (often simply called the ''ESP Explorer''), which featured a design exactly like the [[Gibson Explorer]], down to the same rounded body edges and headstock shape; the only differences being [[EMG, Inc.|EMG]] pickups, two control knobs (versus the three on Gibson Explorers) and the ESP logo on the headstock. Soon after [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson's]] decision to sue ESP, ESP discontinued the EXP series for international markets and began production of the current EX series, featuring a different design with more pointed edges and the usual ESP headstock shape, to avoid any lawsuit.\n\n[[Metallica|Metallica's]] [[James Hetfield]] is probably the most renowned user of the MX series, which he has been using since the late 1980s. He further popularized the series with his legendary \"EET FUK\" MX 220.and his custom [[James Hetfield#Equipment|ESP JH-2]], a black MX 250 with [[Diamond plate|diamond plating]]. [[James Hetfield#Equipment|Hetfield's equipment]] includes many custom made guitars that closely resemble the original EXP guitars in looks as well as specifications. The most recent example (though with a few alterations to body and headstock design) is the ESP JH Snakebyte, which has been available to the public \u2013 along with a lower-priced LTD model \u2013 since the summer of 2011.\n\n== ESP EX ==\nThis is ESPs standard EX series guitar. This is very similar to the ESP LTD 401DX with the only major differences being that it is made in Japan, has Gotoh bridge and tuners as opposed to ESP bridge and Grover tuners and has a bone nut.\n\nOther specifications :\n\n*'''Body Wood''': Mahogany\n*'''Neck Wood''': 3-piece Maple\n*'''Fingerboard Wood''': Rosewood\n*'''Pickups''': EMG 81 (Bridge)/EMG 60 (Neck)\n*'''Bridge''': Gotoh TOM with tailpiece\n*'''Nut''': 42mm Bone\n\n== ESP LTD EX-401DX ==\nThis is ESPs latest addition to the EX LTD line-up. It has exactly the same spec as the original EX-400 but it now has a [[Floyd Rose]] Special tremolo. It is also only available in a black flamed-maple top which was usually never used on the EX series. The inlay was also changed to an arrow shape as opposed to dots.\n\nOther specifications :\n\n*'''Body Wood''': Mahogany\n*'''Neck Wood''': 3-piece Maple\n*'''Fingerboard Wood''': Rosewood\n*'''Pickups''': EMG 81 (Bridge)/EMG 60 (Neck)\n*'''Bridge''': [[Floyd Rose]] Special\n*'''Nut''': 42mm [[Floyd Rose]] Locking Nut\n\n== ESP LTD EX-400 ==\nThe EX-400 features [[set-in neck]] construction in a 24.75\" scale. The [[fingerboard]] features dot inlays with the model name at the 12th fret. It has 22 extra jumbo frets and an Earvana compensated nut. It comes in black and olympic white. The Black with black diamond plate and black hardware was discontinued in 2006 due to the introduction of the Wayne Static Model, which has a chrome diamond plate on top of black finish. In 2007 came the diamond plate in a [[Metallic color|metallic]] chrome color. LTD EX-400bd Chrome-color is the latest Explorer from ESP. The tuning pegs are Grover tuners. It has one volume and one tone control knob and a 3-way toggle. \nNOTE: It was deemed discontinued in the 2007 catalogue, but quickly returned due to mass demand. In 2009, the ESP LTD EX 400 was discontinued, and the ESP LTD EX 401, and ESP LTD EX 401DX took its place as the premium ESP EX series guitar.\n\nOther specifications :\n\n*'''Body Wood''': [[Mahogany]]\n*'''Neck Wood''': 3-piece [[Maple]]\n*'''Fingerboard Wood''': [[Rosewood]]\n*'''Pickups''': [[EMG 81]] (Bridge)/[[EMG 60]] (Neck)\n*'''Bridge''': [[Tune-O-Matic]] with Stop Tailpiece\n\n== ESP LTD EX-360 ==\nThe EX-360 has a [[set-in neck]], 24.75\" scale.

Their earliest conversations centred on [[Bass (sound)|bass]] frequencies and rhythms underlying beats, and they began researching the science involved in creating the most effective [[electronic dance music|dance music]]. Richie founded Fuel Records (UK), and Tipper released the first of several vinyl EP's in 1997. [[Renault]] licensed one of these, ''Twister'', for a European ad campaign. Soon thereafter, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony UK]] signed Tipper to their fledgling dance music label, [[Higher Ground Records|Higher Ground]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Higher Ground===\nIn the late 1990s Tipper completed numerous remix projects of his Higher Ground label mates, and released several singles, each highlighting his penchant for [[electronic dance music]] with extreme bass frequencies and intricate [[polyrhythm]]s; this sound helped usher in a popular new [[music genre]] referred to as [[Nu skool breaks|Nuskool Breakbeat]], and Tipper is recognised as one of the pioneering producers of this movement. In 1999 Tipper released his first album, ''The Critical Path''. It was not, however, the breakbeat dance record that the label hoped for. Tipper's vision was decidedly more artistic than anticipated, confusing the label as to how to promote it, and disappointing sales led to an amicable parting of ways with Sony.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== The Fuel years ===\nDuring the late 1990s while Tipper was busy in the studio, Richie Warren & Co conceptualised the Fuel Sound System. This consisted of 2 identical black 1970s [[Dodge Challenger]]s, both fitted with 6 x18\" [[subwoofer]]s (replacing where the back seats had previously been) and a [[Funktion-One]] mid/tops speaker unit, that could be raised out of the trunk on hydraulics with the flick of a switch from the driver's [[dashboard]]. These cars were able to run independently, without the need for an [[electrical generator]], using 6 batteries charged via an [[alternator]] salvaged out of a [[Truck|lorry]]. With a totally discreet and fully mobile [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]], the Fuel crew, assuming the role of sonic [[prank]]sters, began a \"pilgrimage\" of sound that took them on tour to various music festivals, parties & spontaneous gatherings, setting them up outside events and garnering attention for the label and its artists. One of the [[Urban legend|urban myths]] surrounding these appearances recounts the incident at the 1997 [[V Festival]], when Richie Warren received complaints from [[The Prodigy]]'s [[stage manager]], because the band couldn't hear itself due to the excess volume.<ref>{{cite web |last=Car |first=Pulse |url=http://www.caraudiomag.com/features/0304cae_fuel/index.html |title=Car Audio and Electronics \u2013 Car stereo reviews, how-tos, and mobile electronics news |publisher=Caraudiomag.com |accessdate=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505075034/http://www.caraudiomag.com/features/0304cae_fuel/index.html |archivedate=5 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nWith this activity as a backdrop, Tipper released his second album ''Holding Pattern'' in early 2001. Many of the individual tracks from this album found their way into DJ boxes internationally, and accordingly Tipper began [[touring (band)|touring]] extensively through Europe, the United States and Australia. Reflecting his travels was the [[DJ Mix]] album ''Sound Off'' which he completed for Fuel later the same year. Tipper focused on the music, and Richie promoted a lifestyle \u2013 taking the cars wherever possible to create a [[happening]] around both.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Crunch ===\nTipper and long time friend [[Mike Wallis]] formed Crunch in the late 1990s. The pair released two albums and several EP's together over the following years on labels such as Musik Aus Strom and Mike's own imprint Colony Productions. The Full Moon Gathering 2016 was their first USA performance together in over a decade.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===MyUtopia===\nWhile touring across the United States in 2003 with the Fuel cars, Tipper began composing tracks for what would become his first album intended entirely as a [[surround sound]] listening experience. ''Surrounded'' was released in 2004 by fledgling [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] venture [[5.1 Entertainment|MyUtopia Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_entertainment_group/index.html |title=5.1 Entertainment Group |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034833/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_entertainment_group/index.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/2nd+Annual+Surround+Music+Awards+Announce+Nominees%3B+Honors+Led...-a0110237626 |title=2nd Annual Surround Music Awards Announce Nominees; Honors Led Zeppelin as Surround Artist of the Year, Frank Zappa as 2003 Surround Pioneer; Ceremonies to Include Special Tribute Performance by Dweezil Zappa. \u2013 Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> this [[downtempo]] album also marked a turn in Tipper's musical output away from the [[Nu skool breaks|NuSkool]] [[genre]] which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that [[Digital audio|digital music]] sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. As Tipper toured and performed his album in [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced automobile parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his \"[[studio]]\" in his backpack, earned him the temporary [[moniker]] The Global Nomad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nLate 2004 saw his ''Surrounded'' album re-released as a [[DualDisc]] title, and this in turn led to the creation of his personal [[MP3 Surround]] Sound Player, by mp3 rights holders [[Fraunhofer Society]]. Regarded as one of the foremost composers in the [[Surround sound|multichannel]] realm, Tipper continues to provide content for a number of companies who use his highly detailed productions to demonstrate their own advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/dvd-audio/tipper-surrounded.html |title=Tipper - Surrounded AVRev.com |publisher=AVRev.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008160622/http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/dvd-audio/tipper-surrounded.html |archivedate=8 October 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Tippermusic===\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}\n2005 witnessed the establishment of his own imprint [[Tippermusic]], and he embraced the digital music revolution for the freedom it gave musicians to finally determine their own path. No longer constrained by label requirements, Tipper set about releasing his music independently, mostly via [[online shopping|online stores]]. Some investment was made in CDs and [[vinyl record|vinyl]], but ultimately online sales figures showed their declining relevance for his style of output.\n\nTipper began releasing albums at an accelerated rate. First was the ground breaking ''Tip Hop'', which focused on merging [[hip hop]] production with electronic trickery and helped usher in a new genre referred to as [[glitch hop]]. He immediately followed up with ''Relish The Trough'', which was material consisting of compositions from his catalogue used primarily for his performances on tour. Both albums found favour in Hollywood, and a number of tracks were used as background in prime-time television shows.<ref name=\"tunefind.com\"/>\n\nHis second full downtempo release ''The Seamless Unspeakable Something'' debuted in 2006, with Tipper in full guise as an [[electronica]] [[trip hop]] artist. Tracks from this album also found favour as background music for TV shows. In 2007, he digitally remastered his old vinyl catalogue and quietly released ''The Fuel Years'' and ''Higher Ground''. In early 2008, he decided to make available more of his unreleased \"performance catalogue\" and thus ''Tertiary Noise'' was ushered in.<ref name=\"PMTertiaryNoise\">{{cite web|last=Ranta |first=Alan |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/tipper-tertiary-noise/ |title=Tipper: Tertiary Noise < PopMatters |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis 9th studio album, ''Wobble Factor'' would be unveiled later in 2008, and solidified Tipper's influence on the burgeoning [[glitch hop]] musical movement, especially in the United States.<ref name=\"PopMatters' Best Electronic(a) Albums of 2008\">{{Cite news |title=The Best Electronic(a) Albums of 2008 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/66479-the-best-electronica-albums-of-2008/ |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly after its release, his health demanded his immediate focus, curtailing his studio time and forcing cancellation of all tour dates. While recuperating over time, he laboured on his new ambient/downtempo LP, ''Broken Soul Jamboree''.<ref name=\"tipperinterviewlostinsound\">{{Cite web|last=Dodgers |first=Drift |title=Tipper Interview & Broken Soul Jamboree Preview |url=http://lostinsound.org/2010/10/22/tipper-interview-broken-soul-jamboree-preview/ |publisher=lostinsound.org |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727042109/http://lostinsound.org/2010/10/22/tipper-interview-broken-soul-jamboree-preview |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> This album showcased many facets of Tipper's composition and production style, with striking artwork for the album cover and a limited edition poster accompanying the initial CD run.<ref name=\"PopMatters' Best Electronic Music of 2010\">{{Cite news |title=The Best Electronic Music of 2010 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/134412-the-best-electronic-albums-of-2010/ |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Broken Soul Jamboree'', Tipper released a series of EPs. These included ''Snake Eyes'', the ''Bubble Control''/''Puzzle Dust''/''Shatter Box'' trilogy, and an EP of three remixes from that trilogy, \"Dusty Bubble Box\", which was released to raise money for his medical expenses. In 2013, Tipper announced he would only participate in two festival appearances for health reasons.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/tippermusic/posts/578763182147238</ref> On 6 June, he underwent a successful [[mitral valve repair]] surgery.<ref>http://www.theuntz.com/glitch-hop-pioneer-dave-tipper-to-have-open-heart-surgery-tomorrow-morning</ref> Shortly after his recovery, the full-length album ''Forward Escape'' was released in 2014. It took on a darker, more electronically-driven tone than its predecessors, and marked the beginning of a new Tipper sound. He has since released an EP with a similar sound, ''Fathoms'', and a more purely electronic EPs, ''It's Like...'', and \"Lattice\". The most recent full-length album, \"Jettison Mind Hatch\", continues the pattern of downtempo, atmospheric soundscapes that almost the realm of ambient.\n\nHis notoriety has risen considerably in these years as well, and he is often featured as a headlining act at electronic music festivals spanning the entire continental US, with an extensive showing on the West Coast and occasional East Coast shows. Often, especially when he plays over multiple evenings, Tipper splits his sets into \"uptempo\" and \"downtempo.\" His \"uptempo\" sets feature fast tempos and tend toward being a wild dance party. His downtempo sets feature slow to medium tempos and heavy use of melodies. He has also begun to play occasional ambient sets, which generally have limited seating and sell out quickly.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs of 2015, Tipper continues to play concerts a few times a year, and frequently appears at [[Burning Man]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn April 2016, Tipper headlined his first ever appearance at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA, during Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Gathering.<ref>http://www.tipperfullmoongathering.com/lineup/</ref> He confirmed after the show that he would return in 2017.\n\nIn August 2017, Tipper curated his own Tipper & Friends music festival at the Astral Valley Art Park, 45 minutes south of [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].<sup>[http://tippernfriendzevents.com/the4321event/ <nowiki>[17]</nowiki>]</sup> The event was called '4321' and was held to commemorate the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|2017 Solar Eclipse]]. The venue itself is located in the path of direct totality, and attendees were provided custom Tipper-themed safety glasses to view the event.\n\nIn January 2018, Tipper curated yet another \"Tipper & Friends\" event, this installment being a \"4 Nights in NOLA\" event (also known as the \"4567\" event) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event took place from 4 to 7 January and featured two historic New Orleans venues: [[Tipitina's]] &  the [[Orpheum Theater (New Orleans)|Orpheum Theater]]. In further homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the event included legendary local acts such as DJ Cochon de Lait and [http://maddwikkid.com/ The Madd Wikkid]. This four day event has been the 6th and most recent installment of the \"Tipper & Friends\" events to date.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the \"4567\" event, it was announced that Tipper is expected to present an \"ambient journey\" performance on 20 April at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in Portland, Oregon.

Soon thereafter, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony UK]] signed Tipper to their fledgling dance music label, [[Higher Ground Records|Higher Ground]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Higher Ground===\nIn the late 1990s Tipper completed numerous remix projects of his Higher Ground label mates, and released several singles, each highlighting his penchant for [[electronic dance music]] with extreme bass frequencies and intricate [[polyrhythm]]s; this sound helped usher in a popular new [[music genre]] referred to as [[Nu skool breaks|Nuskool Breakbeat]], and Tipper is recognised as one of the pioneering producers of this movement. In 1999 Tipper released his first album, ''The Critical Path''. It was not, however, the breakbeat dance record that the label hoped for. Tipper's vision was decidedly more artistic than anticipated, confusing the label as to how to promote it, and disappointing sales led to an amicable parting of ways with Sony.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== The Fuel years ===\nDuring the late 1990s while Tipper was busy in the studio, Richie Warren & Co conceptualised the Fuel Sound System. This consisted of 2 identical black 1970s [[Dodge Challenger]]s, both fitted with 6 x18\" [[subwoofer]]s (replacing where the back seats had previously been) and a [[Funktion-One]] mid/tops speaker unit, that could be raised out of the trunk on hydraulics with the flick of a switch from the driver's [[dashboard]]. These cars were able to run independently, without the need for an [[electrical generator]], using 6 batteries charged via an [[alternator]] salvaged out of a [[Truck|lorry]]. With a totally discreet and fully mobile [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]], the Fuel crew, assuming the role of sonic [[prank]]sters, began a \"pilgrimage\" of sound that took them on tour to various music festivals, parties & spontaneous gatherings, setting them up outside events and garnering attention for the label and its artists. One of the [[Urban legend|urban myths]] surrounding these appearances recounts the incident at the 1997 [[V Festival]], when Richie Warren received complaints from [[The Prodigy]]'s [[stage manager]], because the band couldn't hear itself due to the excess volume.<ref>{{cite web |last=Car |first=Pulse |url=http://www.caraudiomag.com/features/0304cae_fuel/index.html |title=Car Audio and Electronics \u2013 Car stereo reviews, how-tos, and mobile electronics news |publisher=Caraudiomag.com |accessdate=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505075034/http://www.caraudiomag.com/features/0304cae_fuel/index.html |archivedate=5 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nWith this activity as a backdrop, Tipper released his second album ''Holding Pattern'' in early 2001. Many of the individual tracks from this album found their way into DJ boxes internationally, and accordingly Tipper began [[touring (band)|touring]] extensively through Europe, the United States and Australia. Reflecting his travels was the [[DJ Mix]] album ''Sound Off'' which he completed for Fuel later the same year. Tipper focused on the music, and Richie promoted a lifestyle \u2013 taking the cars wherever possible to create a [[happening]] around both.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Crunch ===\nTipper and long time friend [[Mike Wallis]] formed Crunch in the late 90's. The pair released two albums and several EP's together over the following years on labels such as Musik Aus Strom and Mike's own imprint Colony Productions. The Full Moon Gathering 2016 was their first USA performance together in over a decade.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===MyUtopia===\nWhile touring across the United States in 2003 with the Fuel cars, Tipper began composing tracks for what would become his first album intended entirely as a [[surround sound]] listening experience. ''Surrounded'' was released in 2004 by fledgling [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] venture [[5.1 Entertainment|MyUtopia Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_entertainment_group/index.html |title=5.1 Entertainment Group |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034833/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_entertainment_group/index.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/2nd+Annual+Surround+Music+Awards+Announce+Nominees%3B+Honors+Led...-a0110237626 |title=2nd Annual Surround Music Awards Announce Nominees; Honors Led Zeppelin as Surround Artist of the Year, Frank Zappa as 2003 Surround Pioneer; Ceremonies to Include Special Tribute Performance by Dweezil Zappa. \u2013 Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> this [[downtempo]] album also marked a turn in Tipper's musical output away from the [[Nu skool breaks|NuSkool]] [[genre]] which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that [[Digital audio|digital music]] sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. As Tipper toured and performed his album in [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced automobile parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his \"[[studio]]\" in his backpack, earned him the temporary [[moniker]] The Global Nomad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nLate 2004 saw his ''Surrounded'' album re-released as a [[DualDisc]] title, and this in turn led to the creation of his personal [[MP3 Surround]] Sound Player, by mp3 rights holders [[Fraunhofer Society]]. Regarded as one of the foremost composers in the [[Surround sound|multichannel]] realm, Tipper continues to provide content for a number of companies who use his highly detailed productions to demonstrate their own advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/dvd-audio/tipper-surrounded.html |title=Tipper - Surrounded AVRev.com |publisher=AVRev.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008160622/http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/dvd-audio/tipper-surrounded.html |archivedate=8 October 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Tippermusic===\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}\n2005 witnessed the establishment of his own imprint [[Tippermusic]], and he embraced the digital music revolution for the freedom it gave musicians to finally determine their own path. No longer constrained by label requirements, Tipper set about releasing his music independently, mostly via [[online shopping|online stores]]. Some investment was made in CDs and [[vinyl record|vinyl]], but ultimately online sales figures showed their declining relevance for his style of output.\n\nTipper began releasing albums at an accelerated rate. First was the ground breaking ''Tip Hop'', which focused on merging [[hip hop]] production with electronic trickery and helped usher in a new genre referred to as [[glitch hop]]. He immediately followed up with ''Relish The Trough'', which was material consisting of compositions from his catalogue used primarily for his performances on tour. Both albums found favour in Hollywood, and a number of tracks were used as background in prime-time television shows.<ref name=\"tunefind.com\"/>\n\nHis second full downtempo release ''The Seamless Unspeakable Something'' debuted in 2006, with Tipper in full guise as an [[electronica]] [[trip hop]] artist. Tracks from this album also found favour as background music for TV shows. In 2007, he digitally remastered his old vinyl catalogue and quietly released ''The Fuel Years'' and ''Higher Ground''. In early 2008, he decided to make available more of his unreleased \"performance catalogue\" and thus ''Tertiary Noise'' was ushered in.<ref name=\"PMTertiaryNoise\">{{cite web|last=Ranta |first=Alan |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/tipper-tertiary-noise/ |title=Tipper: Tertiary Noise < PopMatters |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis 9th studio album, ''Wobble Factor'' would be unveiled later in 2008, and solidified Tipper's influence on the burgeoning [[glitch hop]] musical movement, especially in the United States.<ref name=\"PopMatters' Best Electronic(a) Albums of 2008\">{{Cite news |title=The Best Electronic(a) Albums of 2008 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/66479-the-best-electronica-albums-of-2008/ |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly after its release, his health demanded his immediate focus, curtailing his studio time and forcing cancellation of all tour dates. While recuperating over time, he laboured on his new ambient/downtempo LP, ''Broken Soul Jamboree''.<ref name=\"tipperinterviewlostinsound\">{{Cite web|last=Dodgers |first=Drift |title=Tipper Interview & Broken Soul Jamboree Preview |url=http://lostinsound.org/2010/10/22/tipper-interview-broken-soul-jamboree-preview/ |publisher=lostinsound.org |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727042109/http://lostinsound.org/2010/10/22/tipper-interview-broken-soul-jamboree-preview |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> This album showcased many facets of Tipper's composition and production style, with striking artwork for the album cover and a limited edition poster accompanying the initial CD run.<ref name=\"PopMatters' Best Electronic Music of 2010\">{{Cite news |title=The Best Electronic Music of 2010 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/134412-the-best-electronic-albums-of-2010/ |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Broken Soul Jamboree'', Tipper released a series of EPs. These included ''Snake Eyes'', the ''Bubble Control''/''Puzzle Dust''/''Shatter Box'' trilogy, and an EP of three remixes from that trilogy, \"Dusty Bubble Box\", which was released to raise money for his medical expenses. In 2013, Tipper announced he would only participate in two festival appearances for health reasons.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/tippermusic/posts/578763182147238</ref> On 6 June, he underwent a successful [[mitral valve repair]] surgery.<ref>http://www.theuntz.com/glitch-hop-pioneer-dave-tipper-to-have-open-heart-surgery-tomorrow-morning</ref> Shortly after his recovery, the full-length album ''Forward Escape'' was released in 2014. It took on a darker, more electronically-driven tone than its predecessors, and marked the beginning of a new Tipper sound. He has since released an EP with a similar sound, ''Fathoms'', and a more purely electronic EPs, ''It's Like...'', and \"Lattice\". The most recent full-length album, \"Jettison Mind Hatch\", continues the pattern of downtempo, atmospheric soundscapes that almost the realm of ambient.\n\nHis notoriety has risen considerably in these years as well, and he is often featured as a headlining act at electronic music festivals spanning the entire continental US, with an extensive showing on the West Coast and occasional East Coast shows. Often, especially when he plays over multiple evenings, Tipper splits his sets into \"uptempo\" and \"downtempo.\" His \"uptempo\" sets feature fast tempos and tend toward being a wild dance party. His downtempo sets feature slow to medium tempos and heavy use of melodies. He has also begun to play occasional ambient sets, which generally have limited seating and sell out quickly.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs of 2015, Tipper continues to play concerts a few times a year, and frequently appears at [[Burning Man]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn April 2016, Tipper headlined his first ever appearance at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA, during Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Gathering.<ref>http://www.tipperfullmoongathering.com/lineup/</ref> He confirmed after the show that he would return in 2017.\n\nIn August 2017, Tipper curated his own Tipper & Friends music festival at the Astral Valley Art Park, 45 minutes south of [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].<sup>[http://tippernfriendzevents.com/the4321event/ <nowiki>[17]</nowiki>]</sup> The event was called '4321' and was held to commemorate the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|2017 Solar Eclipse]]. The venue itself is located in the path of direct totality, and attendees were provided custom Tipper-themed safety glasses to view the event.\n\nIn January 2018, Tipper curated yet another \"Tipper & Friends\" event, this installment being a \"4 Nights in NOLA\" event (also known as the \"4567\" event) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event took place from 4 to 7 January and featured two historic New Orleans venues: [[Tipitina's]] &  the [[Orpheum Theater (New Orleans)|Orpheum Theater]]. In further homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the event included legendary local acts such as DJ Cochon de Lait and [http://maddwikkid.com/ The Madd Wikkid]. This four day event has been the 6th and most recent installment of the \"Tipper & Friends\" events to date.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the \"4567\" event, it was announced that Tipper is expected to present an \"ambient journey\" performance on 20 April at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in Portland, Oregon. The event is also listed to feature legendary kora players [[Toumani Diabat\u00e9]] and \n[[Mamadou Sidiki Diabat\u00e9|Sidiki Diabet\u00e9.]]\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year !!Title !!Label\n|-\n| 1998\n| ''The Fuel Years''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 1999\n| ''Higher Ground''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2000\n| ''The Critical Path''\n| Higher Ground\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''Holding Pattern''\n| Fuel Records (UK)\n|-\n| 2003\n| ''Surrounded''\n| Myutopia Recordings\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''Tip Hop''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''Relish the Trough''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''The Seamless Unspeakable Something''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''Tertiary Noise''\n| Tippermusic<ref name=PMTertiaryNoise/>\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''Wobble Factor''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2010\n| ''Broken Soul Jamboree''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2014\n| ''Forward Escape''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n| 2019\n| ''Jettison Mind Hatch''\n| Tippermusic\n|-\n|}\n\n===EPs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year !!Title !!Label\n|-\n| 1997\n| ''Six Pak''\n| Fuel Records (UK)\n|-\n| 1997\n| ''Bassgunner''\n| Fuel Records (UK)\n|-\n| 1998\n| ''Twister''\n| Fuel Records (UK)\n|-\n| 1999\n| ''L.E.D.
