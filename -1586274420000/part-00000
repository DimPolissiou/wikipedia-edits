It is counted among one of the [[seven mysteries of Echigo]].\n\nIn the [[T\u014dhoku]] region, when one receives an injury from a kamaitachi, it is said that by burning an old calendar black and putting it on the wound, it would heal.<ref name=\"youkaijiten\">{{Cite book|author={{lang|ja|\u6751\u4e0a\u5065\u53f8\u7de8\u8457}}|script-title=ja:\u5996\u602a\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Specter encyclopedia|year=2000|publisher={{lang|ja|\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e\u793e}}|isbn=978-4-620-31428-0|page=115}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Hida Province|Hida]], in the [[Niu River|Niu]] River basin, they are said in legends to be a company of 3 evil gods and the first god would knock down the person, the next god would cut with a blade and the third god would put some medicine on it which is why there is no bleeding or pain. There are also regions that think of these three gods as a parent, child and brother.\n\nIn the Yoshio District area of the [[Nara Prefecture]], it is said that when one gets bit by a kamaitachi invisible to the human eye, one would tumble over, even though no blood comes out, there is a big opening in the flesh.\n\nIn the eastern part of the [[Aichi Prefecture]], they are also called

from the wound opening, and even a danger of death. Since these wounds are often received on the lower part of the body, it also states that a kamaitachi cannot jump higher than about 1 shaku (about 30 centimeters).

It currently has around 1450 students, including about 200 in the sixth form.\n\nThe School was formed under the name of '''Ullswater High School''' in 1980, when '''Tynefield''' (girls) and '''Ullswater''' (boys) [[secondary modern school]]s merged.

Majumdar]] says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of [[Sindh]], their only conquest for nearly 300 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:1em; float:right; width:25%;\"\n|+ '''State symbols of '''Rajasthan'''\n|-\n| '''Formation day'''\n| 1 November\n|-\n| '''State animal'''\n| [[Chinkara]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\">{{cite web|title=States and Union Territories Symbols|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112080035/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Camel]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Now the state animal camel|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Patrika Group|date=1 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141624/http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|archivedate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''State bird'''\n| [[Great Indian bustard|Godavan (great Indian bustard)]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State flower'''\n| Flower \u2013 [[Tecomella undulata|Rohida]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State Tree'''\n| [[Prosopis cineraria|Khejri]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|}\n[[File:Sonchiriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[great Indian bustard]] has been classed as [[critically endangered]] since 2011.]]\nThough a large percentage of the total area is desert with little forest cover, Rajasthan has a rich and varied flora and fauna.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur.

The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement published in June 1948. In December 1948, the [[Government of Pakistan]] established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, [[S. M. Ikram|Sheikh Muhammad Ikram]], and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including [[Abdur Rab Nishtar]], [[Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla|Ahmad G. Chagla]] and [[Hafeez Jullundhri]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The NAC encountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.\n\nWhen President [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]] became the first foreign head of state to visit Pakistan on 30 January 1950, there was no Pakistani national anthem to be played. In 1950, the impending state visit of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] added urgency to the matter and resulted in the government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit a state anthem without further delay. The NAC Chairman, then Federal Minister for Education, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics but none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined several different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G. Chagla and submitted it for formal approval.<ref name=\"compose\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.national-anthems.org/history.htm#pakistan|title=Forty National Anthems|author=Michael Jamieson Bristow, National-Anthems.org|accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> On 21 August 1950, the [[Government of Pakistan]] adopted Chagla\u2019s tune for the national anthem.<ref name=Encyclopaedia>{{cite book|title=[[Pakistan Chronicle]]|year=2010|publisher=Wirsa Publishers|location=94/1, 26th St., Ph. 6, D.H.A., [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]|isbn=9789699454004|page=42|author=[[Aqeel Abbas Jafari]]|edition=1st|language=Urdu}}</ref>\n\nThe anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign head of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in [[Karachi]] on 1 March 1950 by a [[Pakistan Navy]] band.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIt was later played for [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] during his official visit to the United States on 3 May 1950.

Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jullundhri were approved and the new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jullundhri himself.

Ghani, a Muslim from [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]'s [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], offered two prizes of five thousand [[Pakistani rupee|rupees]] each for the poet and composer of a new national anthem for the newly independent state of Pakistan. The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement published in June 1948. In December 1948, the [[Government of Pakistan]] established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, [[S. M. Ikram|Sheikh Muhammad Ikram]], and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including [[Abdur Rab Nishtar]], [[Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla|Ahmad G. Chagla]] and [[Hafeez Jullundhri]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The NAC encountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.\n\nWhen President [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]] became the first foreign head of state to visit Pakistan on 30 January 1950, there was no Pakistani national anthem to be played. In 1950, the impending state visit of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] added urgency to the matter and resulted in the government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit a state anthem without further delay. The NAC Chairman, then Federal Minister for Education, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics but none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined several different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G. Chagla and submitted it for formal approval.<ref name=\"compose\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.national-anthems.org/history.htm#pakistan|title=Forty National Anthems|author=Michael Jamieson Bristow, National-Anthems.org|accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> On 21 August 1950, the [[Government of Pakistan]] adopted Chagla\u2019s tune for the national anthem.<ref name=Encyclopaedia>{{cite book|title=[[Pakistan Chronicle]]|year=2010|publisher=Wirsa Publishers|location=94/1, 26th St., Ph. 6, D.H.A., [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]|isbn=9789699454004|page=42|author=[[Aqeel Abbas Jafari]]|edition=1st|language=Urdu}}</ref>\n\nThe anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign head of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in [[Karachi]] on 1 March 1950 by a [[Pakistan Navy]] band.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIt was later played for [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] during his official visit to the United States on 3 May 1950.

Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jullundhri were approved and the new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jullundhri himself. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954. The composer, Ahmed G. Chagla, died in 1953, before the new national anthem was officially adopted. In 1955, there was a performance of the national anthem involving 11 major singers of Pakistan, including [[Ahmad Rushdi]], Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.<ref>Mazhar Iqbal, Mazhar.dk. \"Ahmad Rushdi\". http://mazhar.dk/film/singers/ahmadrushdi/.
