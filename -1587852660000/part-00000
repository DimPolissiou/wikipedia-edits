As, both concepts relate to the ways individuals are exposed to content devoid of clashing opinions, and colloquially might be used interchangeably. However, echo chamber refers to the overall phenomenon by which individuals are exposed only to information from like-minded individuals, while filter bubbles are a result of algorithms that choose content based on previous online behavior, as with search histories or online shopping activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakshy|first=Eytan|last2=Messing|first2=Solomon|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2015-06-05|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|journal=Science|language=en|volume=348|issue=6239|pages=1130\u20131132|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25953820}}</ref>\n\n== Implications of Echo Chamber's ==\nThe echo chamber effect occurs online due to a harmonious group of people amalgamating and developing [[Tunnel vision (metaphor)|tunnel vision]].

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Examples  ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

As, both concepts relate to the ways individuals are exposed to content devoid of clashing opinions, and colloquially might be used interchangeably.

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Implications  ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

It is a multi-component site representing [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]], [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] and early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] periods, with the main occupation being an early Historic component associated with the [[France|French]] [[Starved Rock State Park|Fort St. Louis]].<ref name=\"Schnell\">{{cite book |last1=Schnell |first1=Gail Schroeder |title=Hotel Plaza |date=1974 |publisher=Illinois State Museum, Reports of Investigations No. 29 |location=Springfield, Illinois}}</ref>\n\nEarly French explorers [[Louis Jolliet|Joliet]], [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]], [[Claude-Jean Allouez|Allouez]] and [[Henri de Tonti|Tonti]] were present at the Grand Village of Kaskaskia between 1673 and 1680.  The [[Kaskaskia]] were a subdivision of the [[Illinois Confederation|Illiniwek Confederacy]].  Other Illiniwek groups also had a presence at the site, most notably the [[Peoria tribe|Peoria]], Tapouaro and Coiracoentanon.  Later, other tribes such as the [[Miami people|Miami]] and [[Shawnee]] were present at the site.  In the fall of 1680 the village was burned down by an [[Iroquois]] war party and abandoned.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |title=The Zimmerman Site: A Report on Excavations at the Grand Village of Kaskaskia, LaSalle County, Illinois |date=1961 |publisher=Illinois State Museum, Report of Investigations No. 9 |location=Springfield, Illinois}}</ref><ref name=\"MBrown\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Margaret Kimball |title=The Zimmerman Site: Further Excavations at the Grand Village of Kaskaskia |date=1975 |publisher=Illinois State Museum, Report of Investigations No. 32 |location=Springfield, Illinois}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Grand Village was abandoned, in 1682 the French started building Fort St. Louis to reassure their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies of their commitment.  Shortly thereafter the Illinois and other tribes begin to gather nearby in hopes of obtaining protection.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\nThe Hotel Plaza site is located on the site of an early 20th Century hotel on Starved Rock, within a few hundred yards of the former Fort St. Louis location.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n== History of Archaeological Investigations ==\n\nIn 1948 and 1949 the site was excavated under the auspices of the [[Illinois State Museum]] and the [[University of Chicago]].  Three grids were established: Grid A in 1948, and Grids B & C in 1949.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n== Results of Data Analysis ==\n\nExcavations at the site yielded [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] and [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[Feature (archaeology)|pit features]], [[Burial|burials]], animal bone and plant remains.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n=== Components ===\n\nSeveral [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] and [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] components were identified at the site:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* Prehistoric Late [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic]] Component - c. B.C. 2500 - B.C. 1500; this was a pre-[[pottery]] period characterized by distinctive [[Projectile point|projectile points]] and other stone artifacts \n* Prehistoric [[Early Woodland Period|Early Woodland]] Component - c. B.C. 1500 - B.C. 200; characterized by the earliest pottery made in the Great Lakes area; Marion Thick and other Early Woodland types\n* Prehistoric [[Middle Woodland]] Component - c. B.C. 200 - A.D. 500; characterized by Havana Ware and other types\n* Prehistoric [[Upper Mississippian]] Langford Component - c. A.D. 1500 - A.D. 1600s\n* Prehistoric to Early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] [[Late Woodland]] Swanson Complex - c. A.D. 800 - A.D. 1600s; characterized by grit-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] Swanson Ware (aka \u201cTonti\u201d Late Woodland) pottery\n* Early Historic [[Fort Ancient]] LaSalle Component - c. A.D. 1673 - A.D. 1690s; characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] LaSalle Filleted and Madisonville Focus pottery\n\n=== Features ===\n\n25 [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] were excavated at Hotel Plaza, categorized as follows:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* 10 [[Storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]]\n* 2 refuse pits\n* 1 [[fire pit]]\n* 1 roasting pit like the \u201cmacoupin roasting pits\u201d found at the Zimmerman site\n* 6 late [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] features probably related to the early 20th century [[hotel]] located on the site\n* 2 were rodent disturbances\n* 3 uncategorized\n\nThe roasting pit appears to correspond to what has ethnographically been described as \u201cmacoupin roasting pits\u201d by the early French explorers Deliette and LaSalle and described from the Zimmerman site.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/>  The macoupins are apparently [[Tuber|tubers]] from a species of [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]], perhaps the American Lotus ([[Nelumbo lutea]]).

No tubers were specifically recovered from the Hotel Plaza site, however.  This may be due to the fact that there was no systematic effort by the excavators to collect plant remains.\n\n=== Burials ===\n\nSix [[Burial|burials]] were recorded during the excavations, but by the time the site report was being prepared the remains had been lost or discarded.  According to the excavator\u2019s notes, 2 burials had [[grave goods]] and 2 additional burials had [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] associated but were in such badly disturbed contexts that it was unclear if these items were grave goods or not.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]], [[beaver]], [[dog]], [[turtle]] and fresh water [[Mussel|mussels]].<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.  Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and [[Religion|religious]] implications in early Native American tribes.<ref name=\"Kinietz\">{{cite book |last1=Kinietz |first1=W.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and [[Culture|culture]].<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institute of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nBased on analysis of the pottery collected in the 1948 and 1949 excavations, 4 distinct components were identified.  They are presented below along with their associated pottery types:\n\n===== Early Occupations =====\n\nThe [[Early Woodland Period|Early]] and [[Middle Woodland]] periods are represented by a small scattering of [[pottery]] at Hotel Plaza.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>  The Early Woodland is represented by Marion Thick, the first pottery ever made in this part of [[North America]], and traces of a few other early types.  The Middle Woodland is represented by Havana Ware and Weaver Ware, among others.  The Havana Culture was thought to be a local variant of the main Middle Woodland, which was dominated by the [[Adena culture|Adena]] and [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] cultures of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River]] Valleys.  Middle Woodland cultures are characterized by their large [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], some of which are still visible today; as well as their distinctive pottery forms, [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] practices, [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities, and widespread [[Trade|trade networks]].<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n\n===== Upper Mississippian Langford Ware =====\n\n'''Langford Trailed''' - represented by 3 rim and 7 body sherds; grit-tempered, globular vessels, rim profile vertical to outflaring, decorated from neck to shoulder with fine to wide incised lines or curvilinear patterns made using a stick or antler time.  Decorations take the form of meandering parallel lines, nested arches and reed punctates.  Lip sometimes notched or scalloped,.  First reported from the Fisher site, Period B.  Also found at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]] (Heally Complex), Starved Rock, Plum Island and Gentleman Farm sites.  Related to Grand River Trailed in the [[Oneota]] Tradition.  '''Time Period''': [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]].  '''Cultural Affiliation''': [[Upper Mississippian]].<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/>\n\n===== Swanson Series (aka \u201cTonti\u201d Late Woodland) =====\n\nThis Swanson Series pottery is a [[Late Woodland Period|Late Woodland]] ware first identified at the nearby [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]] site in [[Illinois]].  The probable timeframe of Swanson is approximately A.D. 800 to the time of [[Europe|European]] contact or about A.D. 1670.  The Swanson people cultivated [[maize]] but a large part of their diet was supplied by [[hunting]] a wide variety of game, and gathering [[Nut (food)|nuts]] (particularly [[hazelnut]]) and [[Berry|berries]].<ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"MBrown\"/>\n\nThe following Swanson pottery types are reported from Hotel Plaza:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* '''Swanson Smooth''' - represented by 1 rim sherd; grit-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] vessels with smoothed surfaces and vertical to slightly incurved rim profile and rounded and notched lips. Has relationships with pottery from [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]],<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwest Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref> Starved Rock and [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]]<ref name=\"JBrown\"/>, the last two of which are [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] to early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]].  First defined at the Zimmerman site.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n* '''Swanson Cord-Marked''' - represented by 13 rim sherds and 698 body sherds; grit-tempered, globular vessels with slightly elongated, semi-conoidal bases, [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface, vertical to slightly incurved rim profile, rounded and notched lips, and fingernail impressions at the base of neck.  Similar pottery has been found at the Starved Rock and Zimmerman<ref name=\"JBrown\"/> sites in Protohistoric and early Historic contexts;  and at Fisher<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |edition=1966}}</ref> and Moccasin Bluff<ref name=\"Bettarel\"/> in Prehistoric contexts.  First defined at the Zimmerman site.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n* '''Swanson Smoothed-Over-Cord-Marked''' - represented by 10 rim sherds and 97 body sherds; same as Swanson Cord-Marked except the cordmarked surfaces are partially smoothed over.  This type was defined at Hotel Plaza.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n\n===== LaSalle Component =====\n\nThe early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] Period LaSalle Component is related to the Danner Complex at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]].<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"MBrown\"/>  Both are considered [[Fort Ancient]] Madisonville Focus based on the [[pottery]] types present.  This pottery complex has been thought to represent [[Shawnee]] material culture, and since the Shawnee had an historically recorded presence at [[Starved Rock State Park|Starved Rock]], it has been suggested that the LaSalle Component as well as the Danner Complex may represent the presence of the Shawnee tribe at the Zimmerman and Hotel Plaza sites.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nThe following LaSalle component pottery types were reported from Hotel Plaza:\n\n* '''Madisonville Grooved Paddle''' - represented by one partially reconstructable vessel, 1 rim sherd and 5 body sherds; the partially reconstructed vessel is a shell-tempered globular vessel with constricted orifice, well-defined shoulder, vertical rim profile, \u201chourglass\u201d strap handles and flattened lip.  Surface finish is partially smoothed-over grooved-paddle finish applied below the shoulder and smoothed finish above the shoulder; with punctate decoration where the two zones meet.  First reported at the Madisonville site near [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Related to the type Danner Grooved Paddle, present at the Danner Complex at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]].<ref name=\"JBrown\"/>  '''Time Period''': [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] to early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]].  '''Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation''': [[Fort Ancient]].  '''Historic Cultural Affiliation''': Unknown, possibly Shawnee.\n* '''LaSalle Filleted''' - represented by 15 rim, 3 neck and 358 body sherds; shell-tempered, globular vessels with flared rims, round to flat lips, and a notched fillet on the neck portion.  Vessels of this type have been recovered from the Zimmerman site<ref name=\"JBrown\"/> and the [[Rock Island II Site|Rock Island II site]] in [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], northern [[Lake Michigan]].<ref name=\"Mason1\">{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Ronald J. |title=Rock Island: Historical Indian Archaeology in the Northern Lake Michigan Basin, Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology Special Paper 6 |date=1986 |publisher=Kent University Press |location=Kent, Ohio}}</ref>  Like the Danner Series, this pottery type is also related to the Madisonville Focus.  '''Time Period''': Protohistoric to Historic.  '''Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation''': [[Fort Ancient]].  '''Historic Cultural Affiliation''': Unknown, possibly Shawnee.\n\n==== Other Artifacts ====\n\nNon-pottery [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recovered from the site included:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* Stone artifacts - including [[Projectile point|projectile points]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (subdivided into variants based on manufacturing technique), [[Knife|knives]], [[Drill|drills]], [[Chisel|chisels]], blade knives, a shredder, microperforators, a chipped [[Celt (tool)|celt]] fragment, cores and [[Gunflint|gunflints]].  Of the projectile points, a wide variety were present representing a span of over 4,000 years and including Archaic; Early, Middle and Late Woodland; and Fort Ancient styles.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including arrowshaft straighteners, [[Mano (stone)|manos]], [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]], a [[Celt (tool)|celt]], a grinding stone and a ground [[Pendant|pendant]].\n* Bone artifacts - the only bone artifact reported was one matting [[Sewing needle|needle]].\n* European trade goods - including [[Bead|beads]], [[kaolin]] [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] stem fragments, tinkling cones, [[iron]] knives, a [[bell]], an iron [[Stitching awl|awl]], iron core [[Bracelet|bracelets]], [[brass]] fragments, [[Ring (jewellery)|finger rings]] and [[Button|buttons]].\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; [[Recreation|recreational]] activities; and [[clothing]] or personal [[adornment]].\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

The site adds some more detail to the occupation of the [[Starved Rock State Park|Starved Rock]] area at the time of [[Europe|European]] contact.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\nThe LaSalle Component is contemporaneous with the Danner Component at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]] and provides additional evidence of a [[Fort Ancient]] presence in the area in early Historic times.

No tubers were specifically recovered from the Hotel Plaza site, however.  This may be due to the fact that there was no systematic effort by the excavators to collect plant remains.\n\n=== Burials ===\n\nSix [[Burial|burials]] were recorded during the excavations, but by the time the site report was being prepared the remains had been lost or discarded.  According to the excavator\u2019s notes, 2 burials had [[grave goods]] and 2 additional burials had [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] associated but were in such badly disturbed contexts that it was unclear if these items were grave goods or not.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.

They are presented below along with their associated pottery types:\n\n===== Early Occupations =====\n\nThe [[Early Woodland Period|Early]] and [[Middle Woodland]] periods are represented by a small scattering of [[pottery]] at Hotel Plaza.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>  The Early Woodland is represented by Marion Thick, the first pottery ever made in this part of [[North America]], and traces of a few other early types.  The Middle Woodland is represented by Havana Ware and Weaver Ware, among others.  The Havana Culture was thought to be a local variant of the main Middle Woodland, which was dominated by the [[Adena culture|Adena]] and [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] cultures of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River]] Valleys.  Middle Woodland cultures are characterized by their large [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], some of which are still visible today; as well as their distinctive pottery forms, [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] practices, [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities, and widespread [[Trade|trade networks]].<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n\n===== Upper Mississippian Langford Ware =====\n\n'''Langford Trailed''' - represented by 3 rim and 7 body sherds; grit-tempered, globular vessels, rim profile vertical to outflaring, decorated from neck to shoulder with fine to wide incised lines or curvilinear patterns made using a stick or antler time.  Decorations take the form of meandering parallel lines, nested arches and reed punctates.  Lip sometimes notched or scalloped,.  First reported from the Fisher site, Period B.  Also found at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]] (Heally Complex), Starved Rock, Plum Island and Gentleman Farm sites.  Related to Grand River Trailed in the [[Oneota]] Tradition.  '''Time Period''': [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]].  '''Cultural Affiliation''': [[Upper Mississippian]].<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/>\n\n===== Swanson Series (aka \u201cTonti\u201d Late Woodland) =====\n\nThis Swanson Series pottery is a [[Late Woodland Period|Late Woodland]] ware first identified at the nearby [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]] site in [[Illinois]].  The probable timeframe of Swanson is approximately A.D. 800 to the time of [[Europe|European]] contact or about A.D. 1670.  The Swanson people cultivated [[maize]] but a large part of their diet was supplied by [[hunting]] a wide variety of game, and gathering [[Nut (food)|nuts]] (particularly [[hazelnut]]) and [[Berry|berries]].<ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"MBrown\"/>\n\nThe following Swanson pottery types are reported from Hotel Plaza:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* '''Swanson Smooth''' - represented by 1 rim sherd; grit-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] vessels with smoothed surfaces and vertical to slightly incurved rim profile and rounded and notched lips. Has relationships with pottery from [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]],<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwest Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref> Starved Rock and [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman]]<ref name=\"JBrown\"/>, the last two of which are [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] to early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]].  First defined at the Zimmerman site.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n* '''Swanson Cord-Marked''' - represented by 13 rim sherds and 698 body sherds; grit-tempered, globular vessels with slightly elongated, semi-conoidal bases, [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface, vertical to slightly incurved rim profile, rounded and notched lips, and fingernail impressions at the base of neck.  Similar pottery has been found at the Starved Rock and Zimmerman<ref name=\"JBrown\"/> sites in Protohistoric and early Historic contexts;  and at Fisher<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |edition=1966}}</ref> and Moccasin Bluff<ref name=\"Bettarel\"/> in Prehistoric contexts.  First defined at the Zimmerman site.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n* '''Swanson Smoothed-Over-Cord-Marked''' - represented by 10 rim sherds and 97 body sherds; same as Swanson Cord-Marked except the cordmarked surfaces are partially smoothed over.  This type was defined at Hotel Plaza.  '''Time Period''': Prehistoric to Protohistoric or early Historic.  '''Cultural Affiliation''': Late Woodland.\n\n===== LaSalle Component =====\n\nThe early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] Period LaSalle Component is related to the Danner Complex at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]].<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"MBrown\"/>  Both are considered [[Fort Ancient]] Madisonville Focus based on the [[pottery]] types present.  This pottery complex has been thought to represent [[Shawnee]] material culture, and since the Shawnee had an historically recorded presence at [[Starved Rock State Park|Starved Rock]], it has been suggested that the LaSalle Component as well as the Danner Complex may represent the presence of the Shawnee tribe at the Zimmerman and Hotel Plaza sites.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/><ref name=\"JBrown\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nThe following LaSalle component pottery types were reported from Hotel Plaza:\n\n* '''Madisonville Grooved Paddle''' - represented by one partially reconstructable vessel, 1 rim sherd and 5 body sherds; the partially reconstructed vessel is a shell-tempered globular vessel with constricted orifice, well-defined shoulder, vertical rim profile, \u201chourglass\u201d strap handles and flattened lip.  Surface finish is partially smoothed-over grooved-paddle finish applied below the shoulder and smoothed finish above the shoulder; with punctate decoration where the two zones meet.  First reported at the Madisonville site near [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Related to the type Danner Grooved Paddle, present at the Danner Complex at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]].<ref name=\"JBrown\"/>  '''Time Period''': [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] to early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]].  '''Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation''': [[Fort Ancient]].  '''Historic Cultural Affiliation''': Unknown, possibly Shawnee.\n* '''LaSalle Filleted''' - represented by 15 rim, 3 neck and 358 body sherds; shell-tempered, globular vessels with flared rims, round to flat lips, and a notched fillet on the neck portion.  Vessels of this type have been recovered from the Zimmerman site<ref name=\"JBrown\"/> and the [[Rock Island II Site|Rock Island II site]] in [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], northern [[Lake Michigan]].<ref name=\"Mason1\">{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Ronald J. |title=Rock Island: Historical Indian Archaeology in the Northern Lake Michigan Basin, Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology Special Paper 6 |date=1986 |publisher=Kent University Press |location=Kent, Ohio}}</ref>  Like the Danner Series, this pottery type is also related to the Madisonville Focus.  '''Time Period''': Protohistoric to Historic.  '''Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation''': [[Fort Ancient]].  '''Historic Cultural Affiliation''': Unknown, possibly Shawnee.\n\n==== Other Artifacts ====\n\nNon-pottery [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recovered from the site included:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n* Stone artifacts - including [[Projectile point|projectile points]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (subdivided into variants based on manufacturing technique), [[Knife|knives]], [[Drill|drills]], [[Chisel|chisels]], blade knives, a shredder, microperforators, a chipped [[Celt (tool)|celt]] fragment, cores and [[Gunflint|gunflints]].  Of the projectile points, a wide variety were present representing a span of over 4,000 years and including Archaic; Early, Middle and Late Woodland; and Fort Ancient styles.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including arrowshaft straighteners, [[Mano (stone)|manos]], [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]], a [[Celt (tool)|celt]], a grinding stone and a ground [[Pendant|pendant]].\n* Bone artifacts - the only bone artifact reported was one matting [[Sewing needle|needle]].\n* European trade goods - including [[Bead|beads]], [[kaolin]] [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] stem fragments, tinkling cones, [[iron]] knives, a [[bell]], an iron [[Stitching awl|awl]], iron core [[Bracelet|bracelets]], [[brass]] fragments, [[Ring (jewellery)|finger rings]] and [[Button|buttons]].\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; [[Recreation|recreational]] activities; and [[clothing]] or personal [[adornment]].\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

The site adds some more detail to the occupation of the [[Starved Rock State Park|Starved Rock]] area at the time of [[Europe|European]] contact.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\nThe LaSalle Component is contemporaneous with the Danner Component at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois|Zimmerman site]] and provides additional evidence of a [[Fort Ancient]] presence in the area in early Historic times.  The connection with Madisonville Focus pottery suggests that the [[Shawnee]] may be the ethnic group behind Danner/LaSalle, but this is a matter of sharp debate among archaeologists.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\nAlso the Swanson Complex represents the presence of [[Late Woodland]] culture at Hotel Plaza.  Some of the Swanson material is quite ancient and may date to A.D. 800 or earlier.<ref name=\"MBrown\"/>  It has been suggested that early Swanson culture may have evolved out of [[Middle Woodland]] Weaver Ware, which itself dates back to approximately B.C. 100.<ref name=\"Schnell\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, at Hotel Plaza Swanson pottery is shown to be associated with [[Europe|European]] trade goods so there is strong evidence this culture also crossed over from the Prehistoric to early Historic period.

It currently ranks third in size after [[Kruger National Park]] and the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park]].\n\n== History ==\nThe original section of the park was founded in 1931,<ref name=\"SANParks-Main\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanparks.org/parks/addo |title=Addo Elephant National Park |publisher=[[South African National Parks]] |access-date=2008-04-24}}</ref> in part due to the efforts of [[Sydney Skaife]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/people/skaife-sh/ |title=Skaife, Sydney Harold ('Stacey') (1889-1976) |publisher=Iziko Museums of Cape Town |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718075626/http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/people/skaife-sh/ |archive-date=2011-07-18 |access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> in order to provide a sanctuary for the eleven remaining [[African elephant|elephant]]s in the area. The park has proved to be very successful and currently houses more than 600 elephants and a large number of other mammals.\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe original park has subsequently been expanded to include the Woody Cape Nature Reserve that extends from the [[Sundays River]] mouth towards [[Alexandria, South Africa|Alexandria]] and a marine reserve, which includes [[St. Croix Island, Algoa Bay|St. Croix Island]] and [[Bird Island, Algoa Bay|Bird Island]], both breeding habitat for gannets and penguins, not to mention a large variety of other marine life. Bird Island is home to the world's largest breeding colony of [[gannet]]s - about 120,000 birds - and also hosts the second largest breeding colony of [[African penguin]]s, the largest breeding colony being St. Croix island.

The first mention of the city (with the name ''Aebura'') occurs in [[Livy]]'s  description of a battle between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Carpetanoi, a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] tribe.  After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as ''Caesarobriga'', one of many Celtic [[toponym]]s preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting \"fortified\" that was extended to many non-fortified towns: \"Caesarburg\".<ref>[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.html Juan Luis Garc\u00eda Alonso, \"-Briga Toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula,\" ''e-Keltoi'' '''6''']</ref> Caesarobriga served as an important center for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE  During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] name: ''Elbora'' or ''Ebora''.  Its modern name is derived from ''Talabayra'', the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name.  The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1083.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Foundation===\n<!--\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical\n|image1=Basilica del Prado - Talavera, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|caption1=Basilica del Prado\n|image2=Monasterio de San Benito 3 - Talavera.jpg|caption2=Walls of the Abderrahman III Castle\n|image3=Talavera colegial.JPG|caption3=Colegial Church of Talavera de la Reina\n|image4=Talavera mozarabe.JPG|caption4=Salvador Church's Apse\n|image5=Talaveraworks.JPG|caption5=Archeological [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ensemble in Talavera\n}}\n-->\nTalavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers [[Alberche]] and [[Tagus]]. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area.\n\n===Roman Empire and Visigothic Age===\nDuring the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 179 BCE)|Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of [[Emerita Augusta]]. The leader [[Viriato]], in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE.  In this period Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] the Visigoths established in the city. Talavera was known then as (Ak\u00fcis) or (Aibura). In the year 602, King [[Liuva II]] made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called [[Mondas]], which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary.\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[File:Monasterio de San Benito 2 - Talavera.jpg|thumb|right|An [[albarrana tower]] of the ancient city walls]]\nThe [[al-Andalus|Muslims]] conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries.  Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Badajoz]]. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n-Castile]] seized the city in 1083.{{Sfn|Torres Montealegre|L\u00f3pez V\u00e1zquez|1998|p=476}} The city was retaken temporarily by Muslims in 1109.{{Sfn|Garc\u00eda Fitz|2001|p=164}}\n\nFormerly a {{ill|realengo (regime)|es|realengo|lt=''realengo''}} town, sometimes property of queens, such as [[Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Maria of Portugal]], Talavera was transferred by [[Henry II of Castile]] on 25 June 1369 to [[G\u00f3mez Manrique (bishop)|G\u00f3mez Manrique]] (the transfer was confirmed in the 1371 Cortes of Toro), the Archbishop of Toledo, as payment for the latter's support in the [[Castilian Civil War]], and, since then, the town became attached to the Archbishops of Toledo.{{Sfn|Pacheco Jim\u00e9nez|2001|pp=177\u2013178}}{{Sfn|S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez|1992|p=79}}\n\nThe change from the ''[[concejo abierto]]'' towards a ''[[regimiento]]'' system of municipal government in Talavera should have happened by the second half of the 14th century.{{Sfn|Lozano Castellanos|2015|p=40}} Unlike other locations the chief municipal public offices (''regidur\u00edas'') in Talavera were not subject to transfer from father to son, so the nobiliary elite relied in an alternative strategy to ensure its supremacy, based on a system that allowed them to control the candidates to the ''regidor\u00eda''.{{Sfn|Lozano Castellanos|2015|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nKing [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year.\n\n===15th and 16th centuries===\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, Talavera achieved great recognition, thanks to its pottery. \nWonderful pieces of pottery and Talavera tiles are found in the main museums of the world and in the most luxurious palaces all over Europe.\n\nTalaverian people participated in the conquest of America, like [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]], [[Juan de Orellana]] and Jofr\u00e9n de Loaisa.\n\nOther important Talaverian people were [[Hernando de Talavera]], [[Isabella I of Castile]]'s confessor, and the Admiral [[Francisco Verdugo]]. \nThe beginning of the 16th century saw the release of the most important theater work in Spanish literature, ''The Tragicomedy of Calixto and Melibea'', or ''[[La Celestina|Celestina]]'', written by the Talaverian mayor [[Fernando de Rojas]].\n\nBy the late third of the 16th century the city reached a population of 10,000.{{Sfn|Pacheco Jim\u00e9nez|1999|p=201}}\n\n===17th century===\nDuring this century the city lived in a golden age of arts and culture. Its main exponent is the father of Spanish History, [[Juan de Mariana]], who wrote several books about history, law and politics, and who was very important for French revolutionary theories.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nUpon the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown. Talavera supported [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]'s French faction, which was the winner.\nIn 1750 the king founded the Royal Seeds Factories in Talavera, and 4,000 people worked there.\n\nThe war of independence against Napoleon's army had great consequences for Talavera. On July 27 and July 28, 1809 the [[Battle of Talavera]] took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French. During the fight the city was hardly damaged. The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s army expelled the French from the city.\n[[File:Talavera de la Reina from the banks of the Tagus.jpg|thumb|right|Talavera from the banks of the Tagus, by Edgar T.

In 1931 the Republic was the new political system in Spain. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo.

On September 3 the Nationalist army [[Battle of Talavera de la Reina (1936)|conquered Talavera]] and reopened the terror, this time against communists and socialists. During the rest of the war Talavera de la Reina was damaged by the Republican bombing attacks. The city had a population of 18,631 in 1940.{{Sfn|Atenza Fern\u00e1ndez|Mir\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez|D\u00edaz D\u00edaz|p=10}}\n\nDuring the Francoist dictatorship the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n]] promoted a large irrigated zone in the surroundings of Talavera, following which two new settlements were created, called [[Talavera la Nueva]] and [[Alberche del Caudillo]], the latter located in the neighboring [[Calera y Chozas]] municipality.

Talavera's first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful. The next mayor, Pablo Tello from the Socialist Party, made large projects such as the Alameda Park.\n\nIn 1989 a feeling of marginalization enveloped the city, and a group of people called \"Nosotros Talavera\" (we Talavera) started fighting for the creation of a University Campus and other projects for the city.\n\nA Center for University Studies was opened in the city in 1994; it fully integrated as campus of the [[University of Castile-La Mancha]] (UCLM) four years later, in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anterior.eldigitalcastillalamancha.es/articulo_anterior.asp?idarticulo=cumple-20-anos-el-campus-de-talavera-de-la-universidad-de-castillala-mancha-y-lo-van-170350|website=El Digital Castilla-La Mancha|title=Cumple 20 a\u00f1os el campus de Talavera de la Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha y lo van a celebrar|date=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Main sights ==\nRising over 192 metres, the {{ill|Puente de Castilla-La Mancha|es}}, built in the outskirts of the city, is the highest bridge in Spain.<ref name=elmundo>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/09/28/542706e6e2704ec7158b4589.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|title=Un puente a ning\u00fan sitio|first=Pedro|last=Sim\u00f3n|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> Given the enormous cost and limited use, it is considered a wasteful investment.<ref name=elmundo /> Spanning over 318 m over the main channel of the Tagus, the [[cable-stayed bridge]] it is nonetheless one of the city's most distinctive features.{{Sfn|S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n|Bernal P\u00e9rez|S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n|2012|p=7}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Basilica Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Prado.jpg|Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Prado\nFile:Puente talavera.jpg|Bridge of Castilla-La Mancha\n</gallery>\n== Culture ==\n===Pottery===\n{{main|Talavera de la Reina pottery}}\nThe city is internationally known for its [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], which [[Philip II of Spain]] used as tiled revetments in many of his works, such as the monastery of [[El Escorial]].

Its population of 83,303<ref>[http://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do?accion=busquedaDesdeHome&nombrePoblacion=Talavera%20de%20la%20Reina Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica'', Spanish National Statistics Institute].</ref> makes it the second most populated municipality of the [[province of Toledo]] and the fourth largest in the region.\n\nAlthough the city straddles both banks of the [[Tagus]], few kilometres downstream  from the junction of the former with the [[Alberche]], most of the urbanisation concentrates on the right (northern) bank. There are two islands in the center of the city called Isla Grande and Chamelo Island. Three bridges cross the Tagus in Talavera.\n\nThe city is well known by its pottery craft. The [[Talavera de la Reina pottery]] was declared [[intangible cultural heritage]] by the [[UNESCO]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20191212/ceramica-talavera-declarada-como-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial-humanidad/1993624.shtml|website=[[RTVE]]|title=La cer\u00e1mica de Talavera, declarada como Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad|date=12 December 209}}</ref> \n\n==Toponymy==\nThere are remnants of prehistoric cultures in the area. The village was founded by the [[Celt]]s as a ford of the Tagus. The first mention of the city (with the name ''Aebura'') occurs in [[Livy]]'s  description of a battle between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Carpetanoi, a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] tribe.  After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as ''Caesarobriga'', one of many Celtic [[toponym]]s preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting \"fortified\" that was extended to many non-fortified towns: \"Caesarburg\".<ref>[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.html Juan Luis Garc\u00eda Alonso, \"-Briga Toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula,\" ''e-Keltoi'' '''6''']</ref> Caesarobriga served as an important center for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE  During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] name: ''Elbora'' or ''Ebora''.  Its modern name is derived from ''Talabayra'', the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name.  The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1083.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Foundation===\n<!--\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical\n|image1=Basilica del Prado - Talavera, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|caption1=Basilica del Prado\n|image2=Monasterio de San Benito 3 - Talavera.jpg|caption2=Walls of the Abderrahman III Castle\n|image3=Talavera colegial.JPG|caption3=Colegial Church of Talavera de la Reina\n|image4=Talavera mozarabe.JPG|caption4=Salvador Church's Apse\n|image5=Talaveraworks.JPG|caption5=Archeological [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ensemble in Talavera\n}}\n-->\nTalavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers [[Alberche]] and [[Tagus]]. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area.\n\n===Roman Empire and Visigothic Age===\nDuring the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 179 BCE)|Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of [[Emerita Augusta]]. The leader [[Viriato]], in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE.  In this period Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] the Visigoths established in the city. Talavera was known then as (Ak\u00fcis) or (Aibura). In the year 602, King [[Liuva II]] made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called [[Mondas]], which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary.\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[File:Monasterio de San Benito 2 - Talavera.jpg|thumb|right|An [[albarrana tower]] of the ancient city walls]]\nThe [[al-Andalus|Muslims]] conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries.  Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Badajoz]]. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n-Castile]] seized the city in 1083.{{Sfn|Torres Montealegre|L\u00f3pez V\u00e1zquez|1998|p=476}} The city was retaken temporarily by Muslims in 1109.{{Sfn|Garc\u00eda Fitz|2001|p=164}}\n\nFormerly a {{ill|realengo (regime)|es|realengo|lt=''realengo''}} town, sometimes property of queens, such as [[Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Maria of Portugal]], Talavera was transferred by [[Henry II of Castile]] on 25 June 1369 to [[G\u00f3mez Manrique (bishop)|G\u00f3mez Manrique]] (the transfer was confirmed in the 1371 Cortes of Toro), the Archbishop of Toledo, as payment for the latter's support in the [[Castilian Civil War]], and, since then, the town became attached to the Archbishops of Toledo.{{Sfn|Pacheco Jim\u00e9nez|2001|pp=177\u2013178}}{{Sfn|S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez|1992|p=79}}\n\nThe change from the ''[[concejo abierto]]'' towards a ''[[regimiento]]'' system of municipal government in Talavera should have happened by the second half of the 14th century.{{Sfn|Lozano Castellanos|2015|p=40}} Unlike other locations the chief municipal public offices (''regidur\u00edas'') in Talavera were not subject to transfer from father to son, so the nobiliary elite relied in an alternative strategy to ensure its supremacy, based on a system that allowed them to control the candidates to the ''regidor\u00eda''.{{Sfn|Lozano Castellanos|2015|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nKing [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year.\n\n===15th and 16th centuries===\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, Talavera achieved great recognition, thanks to its pottery. \nWonderful pieces of pottery and Talavera tiles are found in the main museums of the world and in the most luxurious palaces all over Europe.\n\nTalaverian people participated in the conquest of America, like [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]], [[Juan de Orellana]] and Jofr\u00e9n de Loaisa.\n\nOther important Talaverian people were [[Hernando de Talavera]], [[Isabella I of Castile]]'s confessor, and the Admiral [[Francisco Verdugo]]. \nThe beginning of the 16th century saw the release of the most important theater work in Spanish literature, ''The Tragicomedy of Calixto and Melibea'', or ''[[La Celestina|Celestina]]'', written by the Talaverian mayor [[Fernando de Rojas]].\n\nBy the late third of the 16th century the city reached a population of 10,000.{{Sfn|Pacheco Jim\u00e9nez|1999|p=201}}\n\n===17th century===\nDuring this century the city lived in a golden age of arts and culture. Its main exponent is the father of Spanish History, [[Juan de Mariana]], who wrote several books about history, law and politics, and who was very important for French revolutionary theories.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nUpon the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown. Talavera supported [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]'s French faction, which was the winner.\nIn 1750 the king founded the Royal Seeds Factories in Talavera, and 4,000 people worked there.\n\nThe war of independence against Napoleon's army had great consequences for Talavera. On July 27 and July 28, 1809 the [[Battle of Talavera]] took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French. During the fight the city was hardly damaged. The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s army expelled the French from the city.\n[[File:Talavera de la Reina from the banks of the Tagus.jpg|thumb|right|Talavera from the banks of the Tagus, by Edgar T. A. Wigram (1906).]]\n===Civil War and Franco period===\nThe city was getting large during the beginning of the 20th century. The railroad brought new opportunities for improvement. In 1931 the Republic was the new political system in Spain. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo. The city had a population of 16,654 in 1936.{{Sfn|Atenza Fern\u00e1ndez|Mir\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez|D\u00edaz D\u00edaz|p=10}} On July 18, 1936, when the Nationalists had risen in arms, the Republicans opened a period of terror in Talavera, killing people. On September 3 the Nationalist army [[Battle of Talavera de la Reina (1936)|conquered Talavera]] and reopened the terror, this time against communists and socialists. During the rest of the war Talavera de la Reina was damaged by the Republican bombing attacks. The city had a population of 18,631 in 1940.{{Sfn|Atenza Fern\u00e1ndez|Mir\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez|D\u00edaz D\u00edaz|p=10}}\n\nDuring the Francoist dictatorship the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n]] promoted a large irrigated zone in the surroundings of Talavera, following which two new settlements were created, called [[Talavera la Nueva]] and [[Alberche del Caudillo]], the latter located in the neighboring [[Calera y Chozas]] municipality. During the 1960s a ''[[baby boom]]'' caused an increase in the population, added to by the immigrants coming from the nearby villages and poor areas of Extremadura.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Efectos de la verticalizaci\u00f3n urbana en los a\u00f1os setenta en la plaza de la Trinidad de Talavera de la Reina, 2009 (8236596177).jpg|thumb|right|View of the city centre]]\nIn 1975 Franco died, and democracy came to Spain. Talavera's first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful. The next mayor, Pablo Tello from the Socialist Party, made large projects such as the Alameda Park.\n\nIn 1989 a feeling of marginalization enveloped the city, and a group of people called \"Nosotros Talavera\" (we Talavera) started fighting for the creation of a University Campus and other projects for the city.\n\nA Center for University Studies was opened in the city in 1994; it fully integrated as campus of the [[University of Castile-La Mancha]] (UCLM) four years later, in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anterior.eldigitalcastillalamancha.es/articulo_anterior.asp?idarticulo=cumple-20-anos-el-campus-de-talavera-de-la-universidad-de-castillala-mancha-y-lo-van-170350|website=El Digital Castilla-La Mancha|title=Cumple 20 a\u00f1os el campus de Talavera de la Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha y lo van a celebrar|date=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Main sights ==\nRising over 192 metres, the {{ill|Puente de Castilla-La Mancha|es}}, built in the outskirts of the city, is the highest bridge in Spain.<ref name=elmundo>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/09/28/542706e6e2704ec7158b4589.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|title=Un puente a ning\u00fan sitio|first=Pedro|last=Sim\u00f3n|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> Given the enormous cost and limited use, it is considered a wasteful investment.<ref name=elmundo /> Spanning over 318 m over the main channel of the Tagus, the [[cable-stayed bridge]] it is nonetheless one of the city's most distinctive features.{{Sfn|S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n|Bernal P\u00e9rez|S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n|2012|p=7}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Basilica Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Prado.jpg|Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Prado\nFile:Puente talavera.jpg|Bridge of Castilla-La Mancha\n</gallery>\n== Culture ==\n===Pottery===\n{{main|Talavera de la Reina pottery}}\nThe city is internationally known for its [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], which [[Philip II of Spain]] used as tiled revetments in many of his works, such as the monastery of [[El Escorial]].

The original house was built in 1796 and featured six bays and three dormers on the roof. In the mid-1850s, the one-and-a-half-story house was extended south, almost doubling its size, and increased to nine bays including a new double door entrance. The entry doors are surrounded with a transom and sidelights, showcasing original hand-painted stained glass, etched and patterned after the French cross to allegedly ward off evil. The main feature of the Myrtles is the 125-foot-long veranda that extends the entire length of the fa\u00e7ade, and wraps around the southern end of the house. The ornamental cast-iron railing, with an elaborate grape-cluster design, supports a broad Doric [[entablature]], and on the gabled roof, with six brick chimneys, are two large double-paned, pedimented dormers with Doric style pilasters, interspersed with three single-paned dormers. When the original roof of the house was extended to encompass the new addition, the existing dormers were copied to maintain a smooth line. The west facing rear fa\u00e7ade features a central, open loggia that is enclosed on three sides by the house, and on the roof are five pedimented dormers identical to the front.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/myr.htm|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=National Park Service|date=|accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Interior===\nThe Myrtles has 22 rooms spread over two floors. The spacious entry hall runs the length of the house and features faux-bois, open pierced friezework molding, a French [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandelier weighing more than 300 pounds and a cantilevered staircase. The flooring and most of the windows in the house are original. To the left of the hall is the music room that is adjacent to the only bedroom found on the first floor. The principal rooms of the house are found to the right of the hall. The walls of the original house were removed and repositioned to create four large rooms that were used as identical ladies and gentlemen's parlors, a formal dining room and a game room. The two parlors feature [[Carrara marble]] mantles in the [[Rococo Revival]]-style on the north and south walls, and are crowned with elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, made from a mixture of clay, [[Spanish moss]] and cattle hair, with no two being the same.<ref name=\"Myrtles\">{{cite web|url=http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=Myrtles Plantation|date=|accessdate=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406221354/http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe second floor features five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The largest bedroom, known as the Judge Clarke Woodruff Suite, is the only room that is accessed by the main staircase in the entry hall. The remaining four bedrooms, that are separated by a common sitting room, are accessed by a staircase that ascends from the rear loggia. The floor of these bedrooms were raised one foot when the house was renovated, as the addition had higher ceilings than the original house.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe current plantation landscape is centered on a large pond that features a small island centered with a gazebo accessed by a bridge. To the rear of the main house is the oldest structure on the grounds. Now known as the General's Store, this was where General Bradford lived while the main house was being built. Currently it is used as the gift shop, laundry facilities, plantation offices and guest breakfast spot.<ref name=\"Advocate\">{{cite news|title=\u2018Haunted\u2019 Myrtles Plantation gets scare from gift shop fire|newspaper=The Advocate|date=7 August 2014 |url=http://theadvocate.com/news/9929294-123/haunted-myrtles-plantation-gets-scare|accessdate=22 April 2016| location=|first=Amy|last=Wold}}</ref> To the south is another structure that houses a restaurant.

The original house was built in 1796 and featured six bays and three dormers on the roof. In the mid-1850s, the one-and-a-half-story house was extended south, almost doubling its size, and increased to nine bays including a new double door entrance. The entry doors are surrounded with a transom and sidelights, showcasing original hand-painted stained glass, etched and patterned after the French cross to allegedly ward off evil. The main feature of the Myrtles is the 125-foot long veranda that extends the entire length of the fa\u00e7ade, and wraps around the southern end of the house. The ornamental cast-iron railing, with an elaborate grape-cluster design, supports a broad Doric [[entablature]], and on the gabled roof, with six brick chimneys, are two large double paned, pedimented dormers with Doric style pilasters, interspersed with three single paned dormers. When the original roof of the house was extended to encompass the new addition, the existing dormers were copied to maintain a smooth line. The west facing rear fa\u00e7ade features a central, open loggia that is enclosed on three sides by the house, and on the roof are five pedimented dormers identical to the front.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/myr.htm|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=National Park Service|date=|accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Interior===\nThe Myrtles has 22 rooms spread over two floors. The spacious entry hall runs the length of the house and features faux-bois, open pierced friezework molding, a French [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandelier weighing more than 300 pounds and a cantilevered staircase. The flooring and most of the windows in the house are original. To the left of the hall is the music room that is adjacent to the only bedroom found on the first floor. The principal rooms of the house are found to the right of the hall. The walls of the original house were removed and repositioned to create four large rooms that were used as identical ladies and gentlemen's parlors, a formal dining room and a game room. The two parlors feature [[Carrara marble]] mantles in the [[Rococo Revival]]-style on the north and south walls, and are crowned with elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, made from a mixture of clay, [[Spanish moss]] and cattle hair, with no two being the same.<ref name=\"Myrtles\">{{cite web|url=http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=Myrtles Plantation|date=|accessdate=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406221354/http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe second floor features five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The largest bedroom, known as the Judge Clarke Woodruff Suite, is the only room that is accessed by the main staircase in the entry hall. The remaining four bedrooms, that are separated by a common sitting room, are accessed by a staircase that ascends from the rear loggia. The floor of these bedrooms were raised one foot when the house was renovated, as the addition had higher ceilings than the original house.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe current plantation landscape is centered on a large pond that features a small island centered with a gazebo accessed by a bridge.
