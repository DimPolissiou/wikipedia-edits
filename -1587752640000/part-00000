In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series was re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning and one show in night during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series was re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning and one show in night during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians. This population included people subject to a system of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] which was legal in all of the colonies prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=\"Rodriguez2007\">{{cite book|author=Junius P. Rodriguez|title=Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=PA88|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-544-5|page=88}}</ref> In the 18th century, the British government operated its colonies under a policy of [[mercantilism]], in which the central government administered its possessions for the economic benefit of the mother country.\n\nThe Thirteen Colonies had a high degree of self-governance and active local elections, and they resisted London's demands for more control. The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did.

Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G.

Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]].

Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities.

Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college.

Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds.

It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America.

The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, [[German people|German]], [[Walloons|Walloon]], or [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]].<ref>Richter pp. 215\u201317</ref>\n\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the [[Delaware Valley]].

Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

Rowman & Littlefield. p. 92. {{ISBN|0-7425-1189-8}}</ref> The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Woody | year = 1994 | title = The Ohio Indians and the coming of the American revolution in Virginia | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u201378 | doi = 10.2307/2210989 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|alt=''[[Join, or Die]]'' by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule|''[[Join, or Die]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]] was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule.]]\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" with intense protests over the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].<ref>J. R. Pole, [https://www.questia.com/read/89805613 ''Political Representation in England and the Origins of the American Republic''] (London; Melbourne: Macmillan, 1966), 31 [[Questia Online Library]]</ref> They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]]. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 123\u201327</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to British rule and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported it.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201338</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of the Thirteen Colonies (red) and nearby colonial areas (1763\u20131775) just before the Revolutionary War]]\n\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as [[Provincial Congress]]es, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.<ref>T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81\u201382</ref> Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the [[First Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. During the [[Second Continental Congress]], the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\n\nMassachusetts Governor [[Thomas Gage]] feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded [[Maryland]] and brought in fellow Catholics from England.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 44209361|title = Catholicism in Colonial Maryland|journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia|volume = 51|issue = 1|pages = 65\u201383|last1 = Rita|first1 = M.|year = 1940}}</ref> Catholics were estimated at 1.6% of the population or 40,000 in 1775. Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college.

Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. '\"A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) ch. 63</ref> The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.<ref>Lawrence Gipson, ''The British Empire Before the American Revolution'' (15 volumes, 1936\u20131970), highly detailed discussion of every British colony in the New World in the 1750s and 1760s</ref>\n\nNewfoundland was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies. It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783. Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819.<ref>P. J. Marshall, ed.

The \"Imperial School\" in the 1900\u20131930s took a favorable view of the benefits of empire, emphasizing its successful economic integration.<ref>Robert L.

In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up.

Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated. Their form was not as good in the second half of the season, and they were overtaken by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] with two games remaining. Even though Steaua crushed [[FC Gloria Buz\u0103u|Gloria Buzau]] 5\u20130 in the last matchday, it was not enough to bring the title to Ghencea, since CFR won the derby against [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]] and won the title, becoming the first team outside [[Bucharest]] to win the title in nearly two decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/14/championsleague.anorthosisfamagusta|title=Minnows from Transylvania to Cyprus take a bite of the big time|first=Amy|last=Lawrence|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=3 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Three days later CFR Cluj completed a league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]], beating [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]] in the [[2008 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei Final|Romanian Cup final]].\n\nBy winning the league, CFR Cluj qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League season]].

in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Cluj County]]. It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated. Their form was not as good in the second half of the season, and they were overtaken by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] with two games remaining. Even though Steaua crushed [[FC Gloria Buz\u0103u|Gloria Buzau]] 5\u20130 in the last matchday, it was not enough to bring the title to Ghencea, since CFR won the derby against [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]] and won the title, becoming the first team outside [[Bucharest]] to win the title in nearly two decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/14/championsleague.anorthosisfamagusta|title=Minnows from Transylvania to Cyprus take a bite of the big time|first=Amy|last=Lawrence|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=3 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Three days later CFR Cluj completed a league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]], beating [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]] in the [[2008 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei Final|Romanian Cup final]].\n\nBy winning the league, CFR Cluj qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League season]].
