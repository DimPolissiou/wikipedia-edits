This mature mRNA molecule is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm using nuclear pores in the nuclear envelope of the nucleus.  \n\n==Translation==\n{{main|Translation (biology)}}\n[[File:Translation - cycle.png|500px|thumb|Translation process showing the cycle of tRNA addition and amino acid incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain]]\n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\nRibosomes are complex molecule machines, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit) which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits. <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2}}</ref>. \n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications.

In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil, therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymines are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

When RNA polymerases reaches a specific DNA sequence which [[stop codon|terminates]] transcription, RNA polymerase detaches and pre-mRNA synthesis is complete. \n\n===Post-transcriptional modification===\n[[File:Messenger RNA maturation.png|300px|thumb|Maturation of pre-spliced mRNA through polyadenylation and addition of the 5' cap before undergoing splicing]]\n[[File:Export of mature mRNA from the nucleus.png|300px|thumb|Export of mature mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm]]\nOnce transcription is complete, the pre-mRNA molecule undergoes [[post-transcriptional modification|post-transcriptional processing]] to produce a mature, functional mRNA molecule.\n\nThere are 3 key steps within post-transcriptional processing:\n# Addition of a [[Five-prime cap|5' cap]] to the start of the pre-MRNA molecule\n# Addition of a 3' [[polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]] is added to the end pre-mRNA molecule\n# Removal of [[intron|introns]] from the pre-mRNA molecule via [[RNA splicing]]\nThe 5' cap is added to the 5' end (start) of the pre-mRNA molecule and is composed of a modified guanine nucleotide. The purpose of the 5' cap is to prevent the pre-mRNA and mature mRNA molecules from being broken down in the cell before they are translated, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation. In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule. The Poly(A) tail is composed of a 100-200 adenine bases added by enzymes to the end of the pre-mRNA molecule. <ref name=\"Khan2020\">{{cite web |title=Eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/a/eukaryotic-pre-mrna-processing |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis processed pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of splicing. During splicing, nucleotide sequences known as introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule by a multi-protein complex known as a [[spliceosome]] (composed of over 150 proteins and RNA) <ref name=\"Jo2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Jo |first1=Bong-Seok |last2=Choi |first2=Sun Shim |title=Introns: The Functional Benefits of Introns in Genomes |journal=Genomics & Informatics |date=2015 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=112\u20138 |doi=10.5808/GI.2015.13.4.112|pmid=26865841 |pmc=4742320 }}</ref> to produce the final, mature mRNA molecule. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon|exons]], introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode the protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule but are removed by splicing to produce the final mRNA molecule. This mature mRNA molecule is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm using nuclear pores in the nuclear envelope of the nucleus.  \n\n==Translation==\n{{main|Translation (biology)}}\n[[File:Translation - cycle.png|500px|thumb|Translation process showing the cycle of tRNA addition and amino acid incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain]]\n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\nRibosomes are complex molecule machines, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit) which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits. <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. \n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2}}</ref>. \n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049}}</ref>. \n\nThere are five key types of post-translational modification<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151}}</ref>:\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Addition of peptides\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].
