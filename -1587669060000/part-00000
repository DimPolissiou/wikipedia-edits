As with the previous ''Macross'' series, the ''Macross Delta'' staff have scouted new talent for the anime. Auditions began on December 1, 2014. On February 7, 2015, it was reported that over 8,000 people auditioned to star in the new series. The final selection round was held in Tokyo in late April 2015. The finalists went through interviews with the judges, and demonstrated their singing and voice performing skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/02/06/8000-people-have-applied-for-new-macross-tv-anime-singer-audition|title=8,000 People Have Applied for New 'Macross' TV Anime Singer Audition|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=7 February 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Macross Delta'' held a {{\"'}}Ch\u014d Jik\u016b' Seisaku Happy\u014dkai\" (''\"The Super Dimension\" Production Unveiling''), a live-streamed event that revealed more details on the project on October 29 at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Kawamori appeared at the event to reveal the main staff, the winner of the audition for the new singer in the anime, and the new anime's characters.<ref name=\"Kawamori\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-27/macross-creator-kawamori-offers-details-on-macross-delta-anime-thunderbirds/.93436 |title=Macross Creator Kawamori Offers Details on Macross Delta Anime, Thunderbirds|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=27 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Promotional media===\nA promotional visual created by artist [[Hidetaka Tenjin]] an depicting 2 fictional [[dogfight]]ing aircraft was posted in the franchise's official website on Friday the 25th September 2015. Kawamori confirmed that both fighters in the visual are \"Valkyries\" (transforming [[variable fighters]]), and he specifically cited the old Swedish jet fighter [[Saab 35 Draken]] as an inspiration for the darker Valkyrie in the background of the image. Kawamori added that he has been a fan of the Draken jet since he was a child. He also acknowledged that the blue and white Valkyrie in the foreground shares a design lineage with previous variable fighters in the ''Macross'' series and therefore was less of a challenge to design. By contrast, the background variable fighter will feature a relatively new transformation scheme that bears little similarity to those of previous Valkyries.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nShoji Kawamori explained that the two fighters have exhausts in different colors because they were developed by different companies. He also noted that he has been deliberately avoiding more direct design inspirations from current real world fighters, since [[stealth technology]] has made modern combat aircraft look too similar and harder to distinguish from each other.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/> Kawamori added that this new series will emphasize \"Valkyrie versus Valkyrie\" duels as opposed to previous television series. While video productions such as ''[[Macross Plus]]'' and ''[[Macross Zero]]'' prominently featured variable fighters against each other, Kawamori admitted that it has not been the focus in a ''Macross'' television series in a long time.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nThe staff also presented the official designs by Sh\u014dji Kawamori for the two main variable fighters: the VF-31 Siegfried and the Sv-262 Draken III. The VF-31 is flown by the Walk\u00fcre group's escorts, the \"Delta Flight\". Kawamori confirmed that the VF-31 is an update of the YF-30 Chronos that appeared in the [[PlayStation 3]] video game ''[[Macross 30: Voices across the Galaxy]]''. However, unlike the YF-30 the VF-31 design has built-in gunpods in its arms and forward-swept wings.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nThe Sv-262 is used by the Aerial Knights Valkyrie Aerial Knights of the Windermere Kingdom. The new variable fighter design was inspired by the real-life [[Saab 35 Draken]]. While describing the Sv-262, Kawamori mentioned that this is the first time that a Valkyrie with this unique delta wing design variant has appeared in Macross. Hidetaka Tenjin also noted that unlike other Valkyries its cockpit is not transparent.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\n===New series logo===\nThe ''Macross Delta'' logo features a planet within the Japanese characters that form the word \"Macross\". Shoji Kawamori specifically noted that this planet is the main setting for the new series. He also explained that this was made deliberately in direct contrast with ''Macross Frontier'', whose setting was primarily in space. Kawamori started to describe more details about ''Macross Delta'''s setting but stopped short and asked fans to watch ''\"The Super Dimension\" Production Unveiling'' event.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nKawamori pointed out that the delta symbol in the logo is made of triangular symbols to symbolize the three main thematic elements of ''Macross'': music, a love triangle, and Valkyries. However, he also noted that the two symbols are split, and explained that this is indicative that the three elements will not come together as expected in the new story.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\n===The Super Dimension Production Unveiling===\n18-year old [[Minori Suzuki]] from [[Aichi Prefecture]] was announced as the winner of the newest Macross singer auditions. Suzuki plays Freyja Wion, an aspiring idol who is full of spirit and who is always smiling.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/> Other characters include five girls that form the \"Tactical Sound Unit Walk\u00fcre\", the first major songstress group in the Macross anime franchise. (''[[Macross 7]]'' had the \"Jamming Birds\" group, and the [[PlayStation]] video game ''Macross Digital Mission VF-X'' had the group \"Milky Dolls\"). \n\n[[Hidetaka Tenjin]] is credited as the \"''Macross'' visual artist\" for this series while Majiro (''[[Barakamon]]'', ''[[Nagareboshi Lens]]'') and Yuu Shindo (''[[My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU]]'', ''[[Persona 4: The Animation|Persona 4: The Golden Animation]]'') adapted the original character designs by Chisato Mita (designer in [[Capcom]]'s ''[[E.X. Troopers]]'' video game). Other non-Japanese staff members include Thomas Romain as worldview designer, Vincento Niemu as art designer, and Stanislas Brunet as mechanical designer.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nBandai also presented prototypes of the DX Ch\u014dg\u014dkin models of both fighters.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{Further|List of Macross Delta episodes}}\nA ''Macross Delta Preview Special'' was aired on Japanese television on New Year's Eve in 2015, with the all-but complete first episode.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nThe anime premiered on [[Tokyo MX]] and [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]], along other stations in Japan on April 3, 2016.

He praised the episode's beginning for introducing the basic setting and shows the first meeting of Freyja, Hayate, and Mirage along with some short character building scenes for each, but criticised halfway point of the episode. Despite praising the aerial dogfight, he thinks the sudden conflict and the introduction of 15 different characters was \"far too much too fast\". For the music, while the first two Walkure songs are deemed forgettable, he thinks the final song used for the ending and credits, \"Ikenai Borderline\", is great. Richard's main problem is Walkure themselves, referring them as the elephant in the room. He commented \"While their \"magic\" is clearly technology-based, it is something so unexpected in a Macross anime, it's likely to throw even longtime fans for a loop\u2014I know it did me\". Nevertheless, he genuinely interested to see more and hopes much of the information will be sorted out by the time the series makes its true premiere this spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-new-macross-is-filled-with-transforming-fighter-pla-1751068347|title=The New Macross is Filled with Transforming Fighter Planes and...Magical Girls!?}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://macross.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ANN|anime|17762|Macross Delta}}\n\n{{Macross series}}\n{{Satelight}}\n\n[[Category:2016 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Japanese idols in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Macross anime and manga|Delta]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 2060s]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System shows]]\n[[Category:Mainichi Broadcasting System shows]]\n[[Category:Mecha anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Science fiction anime and manga]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Vita-only games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Macross Delta\n| image           = Macross Delta logo small.jpg\n| caption         = Official series logo\n| ja_kanji        = \u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u0394\n| ja_romaji       = Makurosu Deruta\n| genre           = [[Mecha]], [[Romance manga|romance]], [[space opera]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = tv film\n|title            = Mission 0.89: Prologue on the Battlefield\n| director        = [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] {{small|(chief director)}}<br>Kenji Yasuda\n| studio          = [[Studio Nue]] <small>(production)</small><br>[[Satelight]] <small>(animation)</small>\n| licensee        = \n| network         = [[Tokyo MX]], [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]]\n| released        = December 31, 2015\n| runtime         = 26 minutes\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = tv series\n| director        = [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] {{small|(chief director)}}<br>Kenji Yasuda\n| producer        = \n| writer          = Toshizo Nemoto\n| music           = {{Unbulleted list|Saeko Suzuki|TOMISIRO|[[Mina Kubota]]<ref name=\"Premiere\">{{Cite web|title = Macross Delta TV Series to Premiere in Spring With Lagrange, Kaleido Star Composers|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-31/macross-delta-tv-series-to-premiere-in-spring-with-lagrange-kaleido-star-composers/.97102 |publisher =[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate = 2015-12-31}}</ref>}}\n| studio          = [[Studio Nue]] <small>(production)</small><br>[[Satelight]] <small>(animation)</small>\n| licensee        = \n| network         = [[Tokyo MX]], [[TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting|TVQ]], [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]], [[MBS TV|MBS]], [[Television Aichi Broadcasting|TVA]], [[Television Hokkaido|TVh]]\n| network_en      = \n| first           = April 3, 2016\n| last            = September 25, 2016\n| episodes        = 26\n| episode_list    = List of Macross Delta episodes\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Game\n| title           = Macross Delta Scramble\n| developer       = [[Artdink]]\n| publisher       = [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]\n| platforms       = [[PlayStation Vita]]\n| genre           = [[Shooter game|Shooter]]\n| released        = October 20, 2016<ref>http://gematsu.com/2016/07/macross-delta-scramble-announced-ps-vita</ref>\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| title           = Macross Delta the Movie: Passionate Walk\u00fcre\n| type            = film\n| director        = Shoji Kawamori\n| producer        = \n| writer          = Toshizo Nemoto\n| music           = {{Unbulleted list|Saeko Suzuki|TOMISIRO|Mina Kubota}}\n| studio          = [[Studio Nue]] <small>(production)</small><br>[[Satelight]] <small>(animation)</small>\n| released        = February 9, 2018\n| runtime         = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n\n{{Nihongo|'''''Macross \u0394'''''|\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u0394|Makurosu Deruta|lit. \"Macross Delta\"|lead=yes}} is a [[science fiction]] [[anime]] television series that aired on [[Tokyo MX]] in Japan from April 3, 2016, to September 25, 2016.<ref name=\"Main\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/03/10/tv-anime-macross-delta-announces-april-3-premiere-main-voice-cast|title=TV Anime ''Macross Delta'' Announces April 3 Premiere, Main Voice Cast|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> The fourth television series set in the ''[[Macross]]'' universe, it is directed by Kenji Yasuda (''[[Arata: The Legend]]'', ''[[Noein]]'') and written by Toshizo Nemoto (''[[Log Horizon]]'', ''[[Tokyo Majin]]'') with [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] being the chief director and mechanical designer, while Chisato Mita handling the original character design.

As with the previous ''Macross'' series, the ''Macross Delta'' staff have scouted new talent for the anime. Auditions began on December 1, 2014. On February 7, 2015, it was reported that over 8,000 people auditioned to star in the new series. The final selection round was held in Tokyo in late April 2015.

Kawamori confirmed that both fighters in the visual are \"Valkyries\" (transforming [[variable fighters]]), and he specifically cited the old Swedish jet fighter [[Saab 35 Draken]] as an inspiration for the darker Valkyrie in the background of the image. Kawamori added that he has been a fan of the Draken jet since he was a child. He also acknowledged that the blue and white Valkyrie in the foreground shares a design lineage with previous variable fighters in the ''Macross'' series and therefore was less of a challenge to design. By contrast, the background variable fighter will feature a relatively new transformation scheme that bears little similarity to those of previous Valkyries.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nShoji Kawamori explained that the two fighters have exhausts in different colors because they were developed by different companies. He also noted that he has been deliberately avoiding more direct design inspirations from current real world fighters, since [[stealth technology]] has made modern combat aircraft look too similar and harder to distinguish from each other.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/> Kawamori added that this new series will emphasize \"Valkyrie versus Valkyrie\" duels as opposed to previous television series. While video productions such as ''[[Macross Plus]]'' and ''[[Macross Zero]]'' prominently featured variable fighters against each other, Kawamori admitted that it has not been the focus in a ''Macross'' television series in a long time.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nThe staff also presented the official designs by Sh\u014dji Kawamori for the two main variable fighters: the VF-31 Siegfried and the Sv-262 Draken III. The VF-31 is flown by the Walk\u00fcre group's escorts, the \"Delta Flight\". Kawamori confirmed that the VF-31 is an update of the YF-30 Chronos that appeared in the [[PlayStation 3]] video game ''[[Macross 30: Voices across the Galaxy]]''. However, unlike the YF-30 the VF-31 design has built-in gunpods in its arms and forward-swept wings.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nThe Sv-262 is used by the Aerial Knights Valkyrie Aerial Knights of the Windermere Kingdom. The new variable fighter design was inspired by the real-life [[Saab 35 Draken]]. While describing the Sv-262, Kawamori mentioned that this is the first time that a Valkyrie with this unique delta wing design variant has appeared in Macross. Hidetaka Tenjin also noted that unlike other Valkyries its cockpit is not transparent.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\n===New series logo===\nThe ''Macross Delta'' logo features a planet within the Japanese characters that form the word \"Macross\". Shoji Kawamori specifically noted that this planet is the main setting for the new series. He also explained that this was made deliberately in direct contrast with ''Macross Frontier'', whose setting was primarily in space. Kawamori started to describe more details about ''Macross Delta'''s setting but stopped short and asked fans to watch ''\"The Super Dimension\" Production Unveiling'' event.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\nKawamori pointed out that the delta symbol in the logo is made of triangular symbols to symbolize the three main thematic elements of ''Macross'': music, a love triangle, and Valkyries. However, he also noted that the two symbols are split, and explained that this is indicative that the three elements will not come together as expected in the new story.<ref name=\"Kawamori\"/>\n\n===The Super Dimension Production Unveiling===\n18-year old [[Minori Suzuki]] from [[Aichi Prefecture]] was announced as the winner of the newest Macross singer auditions. Suzuki plays Freyja Wion, an aspiring idol who is full of spirit and who is always smiling.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/> Other characters include five girls that form the \"Tactical Sound Unit Walk\u00fcre\", the first major songstress group in the Macross anime franchise. (''[[Macross 7]]'' had the \"Jamming Birds\" group, and the [[PlayStation]] video game ''Macross Digital Mission VF-X'' had the group \"Milky Dolls\"). \n\n[[Hidetaka Tenjin]] is credited as the \"''Macross'' visual artist\" for this series while Majiro (''[[Barakamon]]'', ''[[Nagareboshi Lens]]'') and Yuu Shindo (''[[My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU]]'', ''[[Persona 4: The Animation|Persona 4: The Golden Animation]]'') adapted the original character designs by Chisato Mita (designer in [[Capcom]]'s ''[[E.X. Troopers]]'' video game). Other non-Japanese staff members include Thomas Romain as worldview designer, Vincento Niemu as art designer, and Stanislas Brunet as mechanical designer.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nBandai also presented prototypes of the DX Ch\u014dg\u014dkin models of both fighters.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{Further|List of Macross Delta episodes}}\nA ''Macross Delta Preview Special'' was aired on Japanese television on New Year's Eve in 2015, with the all-but complete first episode.<ref name=\"Unveiling\"/>\n\nThe anime premiered on [[Tokyo MX]] and [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]], along other stations in Japan on April 3, 2016.

He praised the episode's beginning for introducing the basic setting and shows the first meeting of Freyja, Hayate, and Mirage along with some short character building scenes for each, but criticised halfway point of the episode. Despite praising the aerial dogfight, he thinks the sudden conflict and the introduction of 15 different characters was \"far too much too fast\". For the music, while the first two Walkure songs are deemed forgettable, he thinks the final song used for the ending and credits, \"Ikenai Borderline\", is great. Richard's main problem is Walkure themselves, referring them as the elephant in the room. He commented \"While their \"magic\" is clearly technology-based, it is something so unexpected in a Macross anime, it's likely to throw even longtime fans for a loop\u2014I know it did me\". Nevertheless, he genuinely interested to see more and hopes much of the information will be sorted out by the time the series makes its true premiere this spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-new-macross-is-filled-with-transforming-fighter-pla-1751068347|title=The New Macross is Filled with Transforming Fighter Planes and...Magical Girls!?}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://macross.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ANN|anime|17762|Macross Delta}}\n\n{{Macross series}}\n{{Satelight}}\n\n[[Category:2016 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Japanese idols in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Macross anime and manga|Delta]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the 2060s]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System shows]]\n[[Category:Mainichi Broadcasting System shows]]\n[[Category:Mecha anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Science fiction anime and manga]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Vita-only games]]\n", "name_user": "Ganbaruby", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSongs:linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross_Delta"}

Some of the member bookstores offer their books online only, while others also maintain a regular storefront.\n\nBooksellers upload their inventory data to the AbeBooks database, specifying information about each book including condition and price. Prices are fixed (with US$1 being the minimum) and there are no auctions. Items available range from the extremely common, where there might be hundreds of copies listed, to first editions and signed books worth thousands of dollars. In addition to books, the marketplace also offers periodicals and journals, fine art such as prints and posters, vintage photographs, maps, sheet music and paper ephemera such as postcards, letters and other documents.\n\n==Sellers==\nSellers pay a monthly subscription to list their books on the site, ranging from [[USD|$]]25 to $500, depending on how many books they list. This subscription fee has been in place since at least April 2008. In addition, sellers pay a percentage fee for each book sold via the websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.abebooks.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-abebooks/|title=How Much Does it Cost to Sell on AbeBooks and How Does AbeBooks Pay Me?|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAbeBooks initially offered its services for a flat listings fee, based on the number of titles listed for sale. The model was changed in the early 2000s to include a commission on sales. In April 2006, AbeBooks started mandatory processing of MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions on behalf of its sellers and added a 5.5% charge for the provision of this service: previously this service had been optional. In 2008, AbeBooks started charging a commission of 13.5% on the cost of postage as well as the book price. Currently (2013) the commission charge is set at 8% of postage and book price.\n\nSellers can, within limits, set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers. Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site's interface. Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller's location. Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers. Most booksellers who list on AbeBooks also list their books on similar marketplaces such as Amazon.com.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Websites==\nAbeBooks's [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] storefronts, which differ in language and currency, are differentiated by [[top-level domain]] and [[country code]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Regions\n! scope=\"col\" |Sites\n\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|United States}}}}\n|abebooks[[.com]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|United Kingdom}}}}\n|abebooks[[.co.uk]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Germany}}}}\n|ZVAB.com\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Germany}}}}\n|abebooks[[.de]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|France}}}}\n|abebooks[[.fr]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Italy}}}}\n|abebooks[[.it]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Spain}}}}\n|iberlibro.com\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Canada}}}}\n|abebooks[[.ca]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Australia}}}}\n|abebooks.com/books/anz\n|-\n|}\n\nSimilar websites include [[BookFinder.com]] and [[LibraryThing]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[musicMagpie]]\n*[[Alibris]]\n*[[World of Books]]\n*[[Better World Books]]\n*[[:de: Momox|Momox]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web | title=AbeBooks Fact Sheet | website=AbeBooks.com | url=http://www.abebooks.com/docs/CompanyInformation/factSheet.shtml | accessdate=2006-04-03}}\n* <span class=\"plainlinks\">[https://archive.org/details/LehighCarbonCommunityCollegesReadFirstAskLater Radio interview with Richard Davies of AbeBooks.com on ''Read First, Ask Later'' (Ep. 14)]</span>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Amazon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abebooks}}\n[[Category:Product searching websites]]\n[[Category:Canadian brands]]\n[[Category:Amazon.com acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Book selling websites]]\n[[Category:Comparison shopping websites]]\n[[Category:Online marketplaces of Canada]]\n[[Category:2008 mergers and acquisitions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Amazon subsidiary online marketplace}}\n{{Infobox company\n |name   = AbeBooks\n |logo   = Abebooks-logo.png\n |type   = [[Subsidiary]]\n |area_served    = Worldwide\n |industry       = [[Internet]]\n |products       = [[Fine art]], [[book]]s, [[collectable]]s, [[ephemera]], [[used book]]s, [[out of print books]], [[rare book]]s, and [[textbooks]], HomeBase 3.0 (>200 million product listings)\n |services       = [[Online shopping]]\n|parent         = [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] (2008\u2013present)\n |subsid = Fillz<br>[[BookFinder.com]]<br>[[LibraryThing]] (40%)<br>ZVAB.com<br>IberLibro\n |homepage    = {{URL|https://www.abebooks.com/}}\n |foundation     = {{start date and age|1995}}\n |location       = [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada {{coord|48.4335|-123.3798|display=inline,title}}\n }}\n\n'''AbeBooks''' is an [[e-commerce]] global [[online marketplace]] with seven websites that offer [[book]]s, [[fine art]], and [[collectable]]s from sellers in over 50 countries.

Prior to joining Amazon, he was the CEO of the Azbooka-Atticus Publishing Group in Russia. In 2018, the company announced it would no longer fully support sellers from a number of countries, including [[South Korea]], [[Hungary]], and the [[Czech Republic]]. Several hundred other sellers pulled their inventories from the AbeBooks site in protest.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/technology/abebooks-amazon-protest-booksellers.html \"Booksellers Protest Amazon Site's Move to Drop Stores From Certain Countries\", ''The New York Times'', 5 Nov 2018]</ref>\n\nAbeBooks is headquartered in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada, with its European office in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany. The company manages regional websites for North America, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain. Most of its inventory consists of [[used book]]s, including [[rare book|rare]], signed, first editions or [[out of print book]]s. It has been named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers|British Columbia's Top Employers]] every year since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-abebooks|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 BC's Top Employers competition}}</ref>\n\n==Most expensive sales==\nAbeBooks is known as an online marketplace where high-end rare and collectible items change hands. In February 2015, it recorded the most expensive sales ever at the time: a rare ornithology book was sold online for $191,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/rare-books/most-expensive-sales/ever.shtml|title=AbeBooks' Most Expensive Sales of All Time|website=www.abebooks.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref> The website periodically reports their recent high value sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/rare-books/most-expensive-sales/jan-feb-mar-2016.shtml|title=AbeBooks' Most Expensive Sales in January, February & March 2016|website=www.abebooks.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Searchable inventory==\nAbeBooks' users can search across the listings of many [[independent bookstore]]s, thereby allowing small, independent players to compete with bookselling superstores. Some of the member bookstores offer their books online only, while others also maintain a regular storefront.\n\nBooksellers upload their inventory data to the AbeBooks database, specifying information about each book including condition and price. Prices are fixed (with US$1 being the minimum) and there are no auctions. Items available range from the extremely common, where there might be hundreds of copies listed, to first editions and signed books worth thousands of dollars. In addition to books, the marketplace also offers periodicals and journals, fine art such as prints and posters, vintage photographs, maps, sheet music and paper ephemera such as postcards, letters and other documents.\n\n==Sellers==\nSellers pay a monthly subscription to list their books on the site, ranging from [[USD|$]]25 to $500, depending on how many books they list. This subscription fee has been in place since at least April 2008. In addition, sellers pay a percentage fee for each book sold via the websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.abebooks.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-abebooks/|title=How Much Does it Cost to Sell on AbeBooks and How Does AbeBooks Pay Me?|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAbeBooks initially offered its services for a flat listings fee, based on the number of titles listed for sale. The model was changed in the early 2000s to include a commission on sales. In April 2006, AbeBooks started mandatory processing of MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions on behalf of its sellers and added a 5.5% charge for the provision of this service: previously this service had been optional. In 2008, AbeBooks started charging a commission of 13.5% on the cost of postage as well as the book price. Currently (2013) the commission charge is set at 8% of postage and book price.\n\nSellers can, within limits, set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers. Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site's interface. Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller's location. Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers. Most booksellers who list on AbeBooks also list their books on similar marketplaces such as Amazon.com.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Websites==\nAbeBooks's [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] storefronts, which differ in language and currency, are differentiated by [[top-level domain]] and [[country code]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Regions\n! scope=\"col\" |Sites\n\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|United States}}}}\n|abebooks[[.com]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|United Kingdom}}}}\n|abebooks[[.co.uk]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Germany}}}}\n|ZVAB.com\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Germany}}}}\n|abebooks[[.de]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|France}}}}\n|abebooks[[.fr]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Italy}}}}\n|abebooks[[.it]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Spain}}}}\n|iberlibro.com\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Canada}}}}\n|abebooks[[.ca]]\n|-\n|{{small|{{flag|Australia}}}}\n|abebooks.com/books/anz\n|-\n|}\n\nSimilar websites include [[BookFinder.com]] and [[LibraryThing]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[musicMagpie]]\n*[[Alibris]]\n*[[World of Books]]\n*[[Better World Books]]\n*[[:de: Momox|Momox]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web | title=AbeBooks Fact Sheet | website=AbeBooks.com | url=http://www.abebooks.com/docs/CompanyInformation/factSheet.shtml | accessdate=2006-04-03}}\n* <span class=\"plainlinks\">[https://archive.org/details/LehighCarbonCommunityCollegesReadFirstAskLater Radio interview with Richard Davies of AbeBooks.com on ''Read First, Ask Later'' (Ep. 14)]</span>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Amazon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abebooks}}\n[[Category:Product searching websites]]\n[[Category:Canadian brands]]\n[[Category:Amazon.com acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Book selling websites]]\n[[Category:Comparison shopping websites]]\n[[Category:Online marketplaces of Canada]]\n[[Category:2008 mergers and acquisitions]]\n", "name_user": "Kimmy021979", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory:Tell the truth)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbeBooks"}

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the title ''Carol Burnett & Company'', the new series continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].  \n\nThe series also featured Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!

He began his professional career by playing [[Challenge Tour (snooker)|Challenge Tour]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/players.php?ID=45&season=2003/2004 | title=Mark Joyce \u2013 Season 2003/2004 | accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref> Joyce enjoyed an outstanding amateur career, winning the European Under-19 Championship in 2001, the English Open in 2005 and the [[English Amateur Championship]] in 2006, beating Martin O'Donnell 8\u20133 in the final.\nJoyce also finished fifth on the 2005/06 Pontin's International Open Series, winning the second of eight events, to book a place on Main Tour.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2006/07 season===\nJoyce had a very uneventful first season on Main Tour, failing to qualify for any of the major events. He ended the season losing in the penultimate qualifying round of the [[2007 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] to [[Fergal O'Brien]] 10\u20134. He also recorded his highest break of 130 in professional play during the qualifiers. This would remain his highest break until the qualifying stages of the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|2010 World Championship]]. He ended the season ranked 73rd.\n\n===2007/08 season===\nJoyce started the season with 2 wins in qualifying for the [[2007 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] before narrowly losing 5\u20134 to veteran [[John Parrott]] in the penultimate qualifying round. The [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] would be the first tournament that Joyce would qualify for after finishing 2nd in his qualifying group. However, he would go on to lose all 5 matches in the group stage of the tournament. After failing to qualify for the [[2007 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]], Joyce won 3 matches to reach the final qualifying round of the [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] before being ousted 9\u20132 by [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]]. The remainder of the season was fairly uneventful as he failed to qualify for the [[2008 Malta Cup|Malta Cup]], [[2008 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] and the [[2008 China Open (snooker)|China Open]]. He finished the season off by losing in the third qualifying round of the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. His exploits in the season resulted in his ranking going up 14 places to number 59. This will mean he would have 1 less qualifying match to play in the following season.\n\n===2008/09 season===\nThe season started with a 5\u20130 victory against [[Patrick Wallace]] and then a 5\u20130 defeat to [[Judd Trump]] in the first ranking event of the season, the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]]. He followed this up with a run to the final qualifying round of the [[2008 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] in the next event. Another win and a defeat in the [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] after being reverted to a knockout competition and the same result in the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]]. Joyce only recorded 1 win from the next three ranking tournaments, the [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] and the [[2009 China Open (snooker)|China Open]]. His best performance of the season was in the qualifying tournament for the [[2009 Masters (snooker)|Masters]], where he reached final, only to lose 1\u20136 to Judd Trump. The season ended poorly for Joyce with a 10\u20136 defeat to [[Patrick Wallace]] in his first match of the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] qualifiers. Despite this, he ended the season up 2 places to number 57 in the rankings.\n\n===2009/10 season===\nJoyce's fourth season on the tour got off to a bad start with a 5\u20132 defeat to [[Joe Jogia]] in the qualifying for the [[2009 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]]. He followed this up with victories over [[Andrew Norman]], [[Michael Judge]] and [[Barry Hawkins]] to qualify for the [[2009 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. He was drawn against the defending champion [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and was defeated 5\u20131. The remainder of the season up to the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] was uneventful with only 2 wins in 3 ranking tournaments. In qualifying for the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], he recorded a 139 break (his highest so far in professional snooker) against [[Jimmy Robertson (snooker player)|Jimmy Robertson]] in the 3rd qualifying round. He won this match 10\u20139 and then defeated [[Michael Judge]] 10\u20138 to set up a meeting with [[Jamie Cope]] for a place at [[Crucible Theatre|The Crucible]]. Cope was to prove too strong for Joyce as he ran away a 10\u20135 winner.\n\n===2010/11 season===\nDespite starting from the first round of qualification, Joyce managed to qualify for the televised stages of the [[2010 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] for the first time in his career, beating six-time World Champion [[Steve Davis]] 9\u20132 in the final qualifying round. He reached the quarter-finals of a [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] tournament for the first time in his career by defeating [[Ali Carter]] 9\u20136 in the last 32 and [[Judd Trump]] 9\u20137 in the last 16. In quarter-finals, he lost 7\u20139 to [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]]. He ended the season with the highest ranking of his career so far at world number 42, which meant he had climbed 16 places during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rankings after 2011 World Championship |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/64/71/0,,13165~160100,00.pdf |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |accessdate=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Gdb52fS?url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/64/71/0%2C%2C13165~160100%2C00.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2011/12 season===\nJoyce began the season by winning the Pink Ribbon Pro-Am charity tournament, where he whitewashed [[Michael Holt (snooker player)|Michael Holt]] 4\u20130 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Pink Ribbon Champion \u2013 MARK JOYCE|url=http://www.southwestsnookeracademy.com/tournaments/11-Pink/11-Pink-Res_Pro.html|publisher=South West Snooker Academy|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> Due to his new ranking he would need to win two qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events on the [[2011\u201312 snooker season|snooker calendar]].

(born 11 August 1983 in Walsall, West Midlands) is an English professional [[snooker player]] who lives in [[Walsall]]. He began his professional career by playing [[Challenge Tour (snooker)|Challenge Tour]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/players.php?ID=45&season=2003/2004 | title=Mark Joyce \u2013 Season 2003/2004 | accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref> Joyce enjoyed an outstanding amateur career, winning the European Under-19 Championship in 2001, the English Open in 2005 and the [[English Amateur Championship]] in 2006, beating Martin O'Donnell 8\u20133 in the final.\nJoyce also finished fifth on the 2005/06 Pontin's International Open Series, winning the second of eight events, to book a place on Main Tour.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2006/07 season===\nJoyce had a very uneventful first season on Main Tour, failing to qualify for any of the major events. He ended the season losing in the penultimate qualifying round of the [[2007 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] to [[Fergal O'Brien]] 10\u20134. He also recorded his highest break of 130 in professional play during the qualifiers. This would remain his highest break until the qualifying stages of the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|2010 World Championship]]. He ended the season ranked 73rd.\n\n===2007/08 season===\nJoyce started the season with 2 wins in qualifying for the [[2007 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] before narrowly losing 5\u20134 to veteran [[John Parrott]] in the penultimate qualifying round. The [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] would be the first tournament that Joyce would qualify for after finishing 2nd in his qualifying group. However, he would go on to lose all 5 matches in the group stage of the tournament. After failing to qualify for the [[2007 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]], Joyce won 3 matches to reach the final qualifying round of the [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] before being ousted 9\u20132 by [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]]. The remainder of the season was fairly uneventful as he failed to qualify for the [[2008 Malta Cup|Malta Cup]], [[2008 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] and the [[2008 China Open (snooker)|China Open]]. He finished the season off by losing in the third qualifying round of the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. His exploits in the season resulted in his ranking going up 14 places to number 59. This will mean he would have 1 less qualifying match to play in the following season.\n\n===2008/09 season===\nThe season started with a 5\u20130 victory against [[Patrick Wallace]] and then a 5\u20130 defeat to [[Judd Trump]] in the first ranking event of the season, the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]]. He followed this up with a run to the final qualifying round of the [[2008 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] in the next event. Another win and a defeat in the [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] after being reverted to a knockout competition and the same result in the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]]. Joyce only recorded 1 win from the next three ranking tournaments, the [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] and the [[2009 China Open (snooker)|China Open]]. His best performance of the season was in the qualifying tournament for the [[2009 Masters (snooker)|Masters]], where he reached final, only to lose 1\u20136 to Judd Trump. The season ended poorly for Joyce with a 10\u20136 defeat to [[Patrick Wallace]] in his first match of the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] qualifiers. Despite this, he ended the season up 2 places to number 57 in the rankings.\n\n===2009/10 season===\nJoyce's fourth season on the tour got off to a bad start with a 5\u20132 defeat to [[Joe Jogia]] in the qualifying for the [[2009 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]]. He followed this up with victories over [[Andrew Norman]], [[Michael Judge]] and [[Barry Hawkins]] to qualify for the [[2009 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. He was drawn against the defending champion [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and was defeated 5\u20131. The remainder of the season up to the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] was uneventful with only 2 wins in 3 ranking tournaments. In qualifying for the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], he recorded a 139 break (his highest so far in professional snooker) against [[Jimmy Robertson (snooker player)|Jimmy Robertson]] in the 3rd qualifying round. He won this match 10\u20139 and then defeated [[Michael Judge]] 10\u20138 to set up a meeting with [[Jamie Cope]] for a place at [[Crucible Theatre|The Crucible]]. Cope was to prove too strong for Joyce as he ran away a 10\u20135 winner.\n\n===2010/11 season===\nDespite starting from the first round of qualification, Joyce managed to qualify for the televised stages of the [[2010 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] for the first time in his career, beating six-time World Champion [[Steve Davis]] 9\u20132 in the final qualifying round. He reached the quarter-finals of a [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] tournament for the first time in his career by defeating [[Ali Carter]] 9\u20136 in the last 32 and [[Judd Trump]] 9\u20137 in the last 16. In quarter-finals, he lost 7\u20139 to [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]]. He ended the season with the highest ranking of his career so far at world number 42, which meant he had climbed 16 places during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rankings after 2011 World Championship |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/64/71/0,,13165~160100,00.pdf |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |accessdate=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Gdb52fS?url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/64/71/0%2C%2C13165~160100%2C00.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2011/12 season===\nJoyce began the season by winning the Pink Ribbon Pro-Am charity tournament, where he whitewashed [[Michael Holt (snooker player)|Michael Holt]] 4\u20130 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Pink Ribbon Champion \u2013 MARK JOYCE|url=http://www.southwestsnookeracademy.com/tournaments/11-Pink/11-Pink-Res_Pro.html|publisher=South West Snooker Academy|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> Due to his new ranking he would need to win two qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events on the [[Snooker season 2011/2012|snooker calendar]].
