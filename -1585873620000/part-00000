It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 7, 1996. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] starts a [[bowling]] team with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], and [[Otto Mann|Otto]]. When [[Mr. Burns]] discovers the team was funded with his money, he insists on joining, but the team fears he will cost them the league championship. In the subplot, Bart's \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a school riot, so [[Principal Skinner]] implements a uniform dress code.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Scully]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. Scully came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. The episode features cultural references to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine and the film ''[[Caddyshack]]''. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.4, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\n==Plot==\nHomer and his teammates &mdash; [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] and [[Otto Mann|Otto]] &mdash; are unable to afford the $500 fee to join a bowling league. Homer asks his boss to [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] the team while he is anesthetized, so [[Mr. Burns]] unwittingly signs a [[Cheque|check]]. The newly named Pin Pals enter a bowling competition. They beat three teams and move to second place in their league. After recovering from his [[Diethyl ether|ether]]-induced stupor, Burns discovers he wrote a check to Homer and insists on joining the Pin Pals, replacing Otto. Homer and the team fear they will lose the championship since Burns is an awful bowler.\n\nBurns gives the Pin Pals new [[Bowling shirt|bowling shirts]] before the championship game. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn on the lane. When Otto tips over a [[Claw crane|claw arcade machine]], the vibrations knock down the pins and the Pin Pals win. As the team celebrates, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Encouraged by his teammates, Homer attempts to break into Burns' mansion to recover the trophy; this ends disastrously when Burns releases the hounds and Homer is severely mauled.\n\nAt school, Bart's ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' [[Iron-on|iron-on]] \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a student riot, so Principal Skinner forces students to wear [[uniforms]], but not before explaining to Bart about \"Mad Magazine\" and its purpose. The new dress code demoralizes the students until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color to melt and reveal [[tie-dye]] colors that make the children resume rebelling against authority.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Scully by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Mike Scully]] wrote the episode. He came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. |alt=A man with sunglasses smiles as he signs autographs.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Scully]]. He was bowling \"a lot\" at the time, and one day when he was bowling, he came up with the idea for \"Team Homer\".<ref name=\"Scully\">{{cite video |people=Scully, Mike |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The idea for the school plot came later in production when the school that Scully's children went to was thinking of introducing school uniforms. Both Scully and his children were against it so he decided to put it in the episode.<ref name=\"Scully\"/>\n\nFormer [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'' [[David Mirkin]] thought the episode was \"really fun\" because there were \"lots of characters\" in it and it featured \"lots of terrific animation\". Mirkin liked that viewers could see the different characters \"team up\" and how they pair off. \"It's kind of cool to see them hang around like this. Particularly Homer's group which has some nice emotion and they really comes together as a group\", Mirkin commented.<ref name=\"Mirkin\">{{cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nThe episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. When he first read the script, he thought the challenge of this episode was that the bowling theme had already been covered in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] episode \"[[Life on the Fast Lane]]\". Since it had been done before, Kirkland felt pressure to make the bowling alley look \"really good\". Kirkland and his team of ''The Simpsons'' animators at [[Film Roman]] all went over to a local bowling alley and had lunch. They inspected the whole alley for inspiration and drew sketches.<ref name=\"Kirkland\">{{cite video |people=Kirkland, Mark |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"Life on the Fast Lane\" deals with Marge becoming infatuated with Jacques, a French [[bowling]] instructor. Mirkin points out that Jacques makes a brief appearance in this episode, but without a speaking role. Also appearing with non-speaking roles are [[The Last Temptation of Homer|Mindy Simmons]], [[Colonel Homer|Lurleen Lumpkin]], and [[Homer's Night Out|Princess Kashmir]], the three women who almost broke up Marge and Homer's marriage.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/>\n\nMirkin remembered the episode \"very fondly\" because when it was finished, the staff received customized ''The Simpsons'' bowling balls, bowling bags, and Pin Pal shirts as gifts.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/> Scully said the bowling balls were \"really cool\" because they were yellow and had ''The Simpsons'' logo on them.<ref name=\"Scully\"/>\n\n[[Doris Grau]], script supervisor for the show and voice of [[Lunchlady Doris]], died on December 30, 1995, from respiratory failure at a hospital in [[Los Angeles]], California. \"Team Homer\" was one of the last episodes to feature her voice, and included a dedication to her.<ref>{{Cite news |title=TBS premieres 'Survivors of the Holocaust' |work=[[The Journal Gazette]] |date=1996-01-08 |author=Robinson, Dean}}</ref>\n\nIn one scene, Homer tells Marge: \"We were so close to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case.\" The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an [[Academy Award]] in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was [[Haing S. Ngor]]. In American [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to [[Don Ameche]] (who had won for ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''). Ngor, who won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the 1984 film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'', was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nBart and Milhouse buy an issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. Bart also puts a ''Mad'' [[iron-on]] reading \"Down with Homework\" on one of his T-shirts, which causes controversy at school. Milhouse is shocked to see the new school uniforms, and his jaw drops, a \"[[Woody Allen]]-esque\" type of joke.<ref name=\"Scully\"/> The final bowling scene is similar to the final golfing scene in the 1980 film ''[[Caddyshack]]''.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/> Homer references the song \"[[Mr. Roboto]]\" by [[Styx (band)|Styx]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page13.shtml |title=Team Homer |accessdate=2009-01-04 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Moe's unsuccessful attempt to sideline Mr. Burns by hitting his leg with a crowbar is done in a similar manner to [[Shane Stant]]'s attempt in 1994 to sideline [[Figure skating|figure skater]] [[Nancy Kerrigan]] by physical assault.<ref name=\"Groening\">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn its original broadcast, \"Team Homer\" finished 58th in the ratings for the week of January 1\u20137, 1996, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.4.<ref name=ratings>{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings |date=January 10, 1996 |page=F02 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]]}} Retrieved on January 4, 2009.</ref> The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', and ''[[Married... with Children]]''.<ref name=ratings/>\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. \n\nIt was named the fifth best episode of the show by [[MSNBC]].

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 7, 1996. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] starts a [[bowling]] team with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], and [[Otto Mann|Otto]]. When [[Mr. Burns]] discovers the team was funded with his money, he insists on joining, but the team fears he will cost them the league championship. In the subplot, Bart's \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a school riot, so [[Principal Skinner]] implements a uniform dress code.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Scully]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. Scully came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. The episode features cultural references to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine and the film ''[[Caddyshack]]''. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.4, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\n==Plot==\nHomer and his teammates &mdash; [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] and [[Otto Mann|Otto]] &mdash; are unable to afford the $500 fee to join a bowling league. Homer asks his boss to [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] the team while he is anesthetized, so [[Mr. Burns]] unwittingly signs a [[Cheque|check]]. The newly named Pin Pals enter a bowling competition. They beat three teams and move to second place in their league. After recovering from his [[Diethyl ether|ether]]-induced stupor, Burns discovers he wrote a check to Homer and insists on joining the Pin Pals, replacing Otto. Homer and the team fear they will lose the championship since Burns is an awful bowler.\n\nBurns gives the Pin Pals new [[Bowling shirt|bowling shirts]] before the championship game. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn on the lane. When Otto tips over a [[Claw crane|claw arcade machine]], the vibrations knock down the pins and the Pin Pals win. As the team celebrates, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Encouraged by his teammates, Homer attempts to break into Burns' mansion to recover the trophy; this ends disastrously when Burns releases the hounds and Homer is severely mauled.\n\nAt school, Bart's ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' [[Iron-on|iron-on]] \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a student riot, so Principal Skinner forces students to wear [[uniforms]], but not before explaining to Bart about \"Mad\" and its purpose. The new dress code demoralizes the students until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color to melt and reveal [[tie-dye]] colors that make the children resume rebelling against authority.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Scully by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Mike Scully]] wrote the episode. He came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. |alt=A man with sunglasses smiles as he signs autographs.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Scully]]. He was bowling \"a lot\" at the time, and one day when he was bowling, he came up with the idea for \"Team Homer\".<ref name=\"Scully\">{{cite video |people=Scully, Mike |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The idea for the school plot came later in production when the school that Scully's children went to was thinking of introducing school uniforms. Both Scully and his children were against it so he decided to put it in the episode.<ref name=\"Scully\"/>\n\nFormer [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'' [[David Mirkin]] thought the episode was \"really fun\" because there were \"lots of characters\" in it and it featured \"lots of terrific animation\". Mirkin liked that viewers could see the different characters \"team up\" and how they pair off. \"It's kind of cool to see them hang around like this. Particularly Homer's group which has some nice emotion and they really comes together as a group\", Mirkin commented.<ref name=\"Mirkin\">{{cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nThe episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. When he first read the script, he thought the challenge of this episode was that the bowling theme had already been covered in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] episode \"[[Life on the Fast Lane]]\". Since it had been done before, Kirkland felt pressure to make the bowling alley look \"really good\". Kirkland and his team of ''The Simpsons'' animators at [[Film Roman]] all went over to a local bowling alley and had lunch. They inspected the whole alley for inspiration and drew sketches.<ref name=\"Kirkland\">{{cite video |people=Kirkland, Mark |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"Life on the Fast Lane\" deals with Marge becoming infatuated with Jacques, a French [[bowling]] instructor. Mirkin points out that Jacques makes a brief appearance in this episode, but without a speaking role. Also appearing with non-speaking roles are [[The Last Temptation of Homer|Mindy Simmons]], [[Colonel Homer|Lurleen Lumpkin]], and [[Homer's Night Out|Princess Kashmir]], the three women who almost broke up Marge and Homer's marriage.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/>\n\nMirkin remembered the episode \"very fondly\" because when it was finished, the staff received customized ''The Simpsons'' bowling balls, bowling bags, and Pin Pal shirts as gifts.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/> Scully said the bowling balls were \"really cool\" because they were yellow and had ''The Simpsons'' logo on them.<ref name=\"Scully\"/>\n\n[[Doris Grau]], script supervisor for the show and voice of [[Lunchlady Doris]], died on December 30, 1995, from respiratory failure at a hospital in [[Los Angeles]], California. \"Team Homer\" was one of the last episodes to feature her voice, and included a dedication to her.<ref>{{Cite news |title=TBS premieres 'Survivors of the Holocaust' |work=[[The Journal Gazette]] |date=1996-01-08 |author=Robinson, Dean}}</ref>\n\nIn one scene, Homer tells Marge: \"We were so close to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case.\" The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an [[Academy Award]] in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was [[Haing S. Ngor]]. In American [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to [[Don Ameche]] (who had won for ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''). Ngor, who won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the 1984 film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'', was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nBart and Milhouse buy an issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. Bart also puts a ''Mad'' [[iron-on]] reading \"Down with Homework\" on one of his T-shirts, which causes controversy at school. Milhouse is shocked to see the new school uniforms, and his jaw drops, a \"[[Woody Allen]]-esque\" type of joke.<ref name=\"Scully\"/> The final bowling scene is similar to the final golfing scene in the 1980 film ''[[Caddyshack]]''.<ref name=\"Mirkin\"/> Homer references the song \"[[Mr. Roboto]]\" by [[Styx (band)|Styx]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page13.shtml |title=Team Homer |accessdate=2009-01-04 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Moe's unsuccessful attempt to sideline Mr. Burns by hitting his leg with a crowbar is done in a similar manner to [[Shane Stant]]'s attempt in 1994 to sideline [[Figure skating|figure skater]] [[Nancy Kerrigan]] by physical assault.<ref name=\"Groening\">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"Team Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn its original broadcast, \"Team Homer\" finished 58th in the ratings for the week of January 1\u20137, 1996, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.4.<ref name=ratings>{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings |date=January 10, 1996 |page=F02 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]]}} Retrieved on January 4, 2009.</ref> The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', and ''[[Married... with Children]]''.<ref name=ratings/>\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. \n\nIt was named the fifth best episode of the show by [[MSNBC]].

[[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] as the hosts and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], as the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 14 spots open for competition.\n\nThe qualification rounds for the four previous World Cups were very confusing, with controversial rules and many withdrawals. From this tournament onwards, [[FIFA]] decided to divide the teams into several continental zones, assign a pre-determined number of places in the final tournament to each zone, and delegate the organization of the qualifying tournaments to its confederations: [[UEFA]] of Europe, [[CONMEBOL]] of South America, [[North American Football Confederation|NAFC]] of North America, [[Confederaci\u00f3n Centroamericana y del Caribe de F\u00fatbol|CCCF]] of Central America and Caribbean, [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] of Africa and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] of Asia (and [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] of Oceania after it was formed later). This led to a more organized qualification process with clearer rules, but not yet withdrawal-proof.\n\nThe 16 spots available in the 1958 World Cup would be distributed among the continental zones as follows:\n*Europe ([[UEFA]]): ''11 places'', 2 of them went to automatic qualifiers [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], while the other 9 places were contested by 27 teams.\n*South America ([[CONMEBOL]]): ''3 places'', contested by 9 teams.\n*North, Central America and Caribbean ([[North American Football Confederation|NAFC]]/[[Confederaci\u00f3n Centroamericana y del Caribe de F\u00fatbol|CCCF]]): ''1 place'', contested by 6 teams.\n*Africa ([[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]) and Asia ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]): ''1 place'', contested by 11 teams (including [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]).\nHowever, FIFA also imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match because many teams qualified for previous World Cups without playing due to withdrawals of their opponents. Because [[Israel national football team|Israel]]  won the African and Asian zone under this circumstance, FIFA required them to enter a play-off against a team from Europe who initially did not qualify, with the winner of this play-off qualifying. Therefore, effectively in the end, a total of ''11.5 places'' were granted to Europe while only ''0.5 places'' were granted to Africa and Asia.\n\nA total of 46 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 89 qualifying matches were played, and 341 goals were scored (an average of 3.83 per match).\n\nListed below are the dates and results of the qualification rounds.\n\n==Europe==\nThe 27 teams were divided into 9 groups, each featuring 3 teams. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners qualified. The [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] took part for the first time.\n\n===UEFA Group 1===\n\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 1)}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=30|Rank\n!  style=\"width:165px; text-align:left;\"|Team\n!width=20|{{tooltip|Pts|Points}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GAv|Goal average}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|'''1'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ENG}}\n|'''7'''||4||3||1||0||15||5||3.00\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|IRL}}\n|'''5'''||4||2||1||1||6||7||0.86\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|DEN}}\n|'''0'''||4||0||0||4||4||13||0.31\n|}\n\n{{footballbox_collapsible\n|date = 3 October 1956\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|IRL}}\n|score = 2 &ndash; 1\n|report = [http://scoreshelf.com/gjbb/en/Republic_of_Ireland/1958fwcIRL_v_DNK Report]\n|team2 = {{fb|DEN}}\n|goals1 = [[Dermot Curtis|Curtis]] {{goal|27}}<br />[[Johnny Gavin (footballer)|Gavin]] {{goal|45|pen.}}\n|goals2 = [[Aage Rou Jensen|Aa.

[[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] as the hosts and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], as the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 14 spots open for competition.\n\nThe qualification rounds for the four previous World Cups were very confusing, with controversial rules and many withdrawals. From this tournament onwards, [[FIFA]] decided to divide the teams into several continental zones, assign a pre-determined number of places in the final tournament to each zone, and delegate the organization of the qualifying tournaments to its confederations: [[UEFA]] of Europe, [[CONMEBOL]] of South America, [[North American Football Confederation|NAFC]] of North America, [[Confederaci\u00f3n Centroamericana y del Caribe de F\u00fatbol|CCCF]] of Central America and Caribbean, [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] of Africa and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] of Asia (and [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] of Oceania after it was formed later). This led to a more organized qualification process with clearer rules, but not yet withdrawal-proof.\n\nThe 16 spots available in the 1958 World Cup would be distributed among the continental zones as follows:\n*Europe ([[UEFA]]): ''11 places'', 2 of them went to automatic qualifiers [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], while the other 9 places were contested by 27 teams.\n*South America ([[CONMEBOL]]): ''3 places'', contested by 9 teams.\n*North, Central America and Caribbean ([[North American Football Confederation|NAFC]]/[[Confederaci\u00f3n Centroamericana y del Caribe de F\u00fatbol|CCCF]]): ''1 place'', contested by 6 teams.\n*Africa ([[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]) and Asia ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]): ''1 place'', contested by 11 teams (including [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]).\nHowever, FIFA also imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match because many teams qualified for previous World Cups without playing due to withdrawals of their opponents. Because [[Israel national football team|Israel]]  won the African and Asian zone under this circumstance, FIFA required them to enter a play-off against a team from Europe who initially did not qualify, with the winner of this play-off qualifying. Therefore, effectively in the end, a total of ''11.5 places'' were granted to Europe while only ''0.5 places'' were granted to Africa and Asia.\n\nA total of 46 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 89 qualifying matches were played, and 341 goals were scored (an average of 3.83 per match).\n\nListed below are the dates and results of the qualification rounds.\n\n==Europe==\nThe 27 teams were divided into 9 groups, each featuring 3 teams. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners qualified. The [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] took part for the first time.\n\n===UEFA Group 1===\n\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 1)}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=30|Rank\n!  style=\"width:165px; text-align:left;\"|Team\n!width=20|{{tooltip|Pts|Points}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{tooltip|GAv|Goal average}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|'''1'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ENG}}\n|'''7'''||4||3||1||0||15||5||3.00\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|IRL}}\n|'''5'''||4||2||1||1||6||7||0.86\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|DEN}}\n|'''0'''||4||0||0||4||4||13||0.31\n|}\n\n{{footballbox_collapsible\n|date = 3 October 1956\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|IRL}}\n|score = 2 &ndash; 1\n|report = [http://scoreshelf.com/gjbb/en/Republic_of_Ireland/1958fwcIRL_v_DNK Report]\n|team2 = {{fb|DEN}}\n|goals1 = [[Dermot Curtis|Curtis]] {{goal|27}}<br />[[Johnny Gavin (footballer)|Gavin]] {{goal|45|pen.}}\n|goals2 = [[Aage Rou Jensen|Aa.

{"title_page": "Dynamo Duck", "text_new": "'''Dynamo Duck'''  ({{lang-fr|Saturnin le canard}}) was the main character in the children's series ''The Adventures of Dynamo Duck'', which aired on television in the early 1990s.\n\n==Overview==\nThe origin of the series lies with the French film maker [[Jean Tourane]]. During the 1960s, he filmed for a children's television series ''Saturnin le canard'' about the [[duckling]] Saturnin who had all kinds of adventures. The series was produced using real animals, dressed up with sunglasses, hats, etcetera, inside a miniature world. The series, first produced in 1964 (according to the [[Internet Movie Database]]) was shown on French television.\n\nYears later, the footage was bought by the American producer [[Nathan Sassover]]. Originally, clips of it were used as [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] leading into and out of commercials on the [[Fox Kids]] network. Later, Sassover had the different pieces of film edited in a new way and hired writers to create new characters and storylines to produce a ''[[James Bond]]''-style show in a series of two-minute shorts. Again a small duck was the main character, fighting crimes of the evil Dr. Mortek (a monkey) and other assorted villains. The animals wander around on miniature sets with scale models of trucks and other vehicles. The duck, this time going by the name of \"Dynamo Duck\", was driving around in a miniature Jaguar.\n\nWhat makes this series unique prior to the advent of computer animation was the way the mouth movements of the animals, specifically the ducks, with the precise dialog dubbed in gives the appearance of the animals speaking.  The principal duckling was voiced-over by [[Dan Castellaneta]], using a terse, clipped style parodying ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'''  [[Robert Stack]]. The first season aired in 1991 on [[Fox Kids]]. The shorts aired once a week during the Fox Kids' Saturday morning line-up in between the half-hour programs.  Where it appeared on the schedule wasn't announced and aired at inconsistent times.  Even the [[Promo (media)|promo]] for the series narrated by Dynamo says ''\"Saturday mornings on FOX\"'', but no specific time ever revealed. For fans to follow and collect the series, it was often necessary to record the entire morning line-up so as not to miss it.  At the end of every show, Dynamo Duck said ''\"We take care of our animals, and so should you!\"''. The second season of Dynamo Duck is widely regarded as vastly inferior to the first that relied more heavily on reuse of footage, and recycled storylines.  Dynamo's voice-over was modified in a manner similar to [[Don Adams]]' ''[[Get Smart]]'' role of [[Maxwell Smart]].  There are over 100 shorts in the series.\n\nLater, in the mid-90's, the series had a brief afterlife airing overnights on the now defunct [[Network One]] (N1).  The episodes were five minutes in length, including end credits.  Many of which were expansions of their two-minute counterparts from Fox Kids.  Some combined two two-minute shorts to make a five-minute double episode with bridges either at the beginning, middle or end of each story, or a combination thereof.  Due to the limited number of indie and low-powered stations that carried Network One, the series aired nearly unnoticed except by night owls.\n\nThe scoring was provided by a number of composers often multiple people on the same shorts, including:\nThomas Chase,\nSteve Rucker,\nNathan Sassover,\nPaul Menichini,\nMisho Segal,\nPeter Frampton,\n''et al.''\n\n== The characters and their roles ==\nDynamo Duck is the top secret agent of D.U.X., which stands for ''Dynamic Undercover Excellence''. Dynamo's nemesis, Dr. Mortek, is the leader of S.K.U.Z., which is ''Sleazy Killers, Usurpers, and Zealots''.  It was also referred to as the ''Society of Killers, Usurpers and Zealots''.  Many other crime and espionage organizations were known by their acronyms.  Such as H.O.A.X. (''the Horrible Organization Against Excellence''), S.N.O.B. (''the Secret Nefarious Order of Blowhards''), Y.A.H.O.O. (''Yokels Against Happiness, Optimism and Order''), G.O.O.F.U.S. (''Goons On the Orders to Foul Up Society''), T.O.X.I.C. (''Totally Obnoxious, Extremely Insidious Criminals''), W.H.O.M. (''Wiley Horrendous Obnoxious Maniacs''), L.U.S.H. (''Low, Underhanded Sot-faced Hitmen''), and S.N.O.R.E. (''Slumbering Nemesis Of Righteousness Everywhere'').  The Loonies are a religious cult living like medieval knights.  Loonies is not an acronym.  Many of the agents working for these organizations were, but not limited to, weasels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Good guys\n! Title\n!

In practice, the [[covariance]] (and sometimes the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]]) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the data is constructed and the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvectors]] on this matrix are computed. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system, because they often contribute the vast majority of the system's energy, especially in low-dimensional systems. Still, this must be proven on a case-by-case basis as not all systems exhibit this behavior. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} {{Why|date=September 2017}}. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.\n\n===Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)===\n{{main article|Non-negative matrix factorization}}\n\nNMF decomposes a non-negative matrix to the product of two non-negative ones, which has been a promising tool in fields where only non-negative signals exist.<ref name=\"lee-seung\">{{Cite journal\n | author = Daniel D.

The resulting technique is capable of constructing nonlinear mappings that maximize the variance in the data. The resulting technique is entitled [[kernel PCA]].\n\n===Graph-based kernel PCA===\nOther prominent nonlinear techniques include [[manifold learning]] techniques such as [[Isomap]], [[locally linear embedding]] (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and methods based on tangent space analysis<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Zhenyue|last2=Zha|first2=Hongyuan|date=2004|title=Principal Manifolds and Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction via Tangent Space Alignment|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=26|issue=1|pages=313\u2013338|doi=10.1137/s1064827502419154|issn=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Yoshua|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Larochelle|first3=Hugo|date=2006|title=Nonlocal Estimation of Manifold Structure|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01575345/document|journal=Neural Computation|language=en|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2509\u20132528|doi=10.1162/neco.2006.18.10.2509|pmid=16907635|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4230}}</ref>. These techniques construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA.\n\nMore recently, techniques have been proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel using [[semidefinite programming]]. The most prominent example of such a technique is [[maximum variance unfolding]] (MVU). The central idea of MVU is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors (in the inner product space), while maximizing the distances between points that are not nearest neighbors.\n\nAn alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the minimization of a cost function that measures differences between distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such techniques include: classical [[multidimensional scaling]], which is identical to PCA; [[Isomap]], which uses geodesic distances in the data space; [[diffusion map]]s, which use diffusion distances in the data space; [[t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding]] (t-SNE), which minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points; and curvilinear component analysis.\n\nA different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the use of [[autoencoder]]s, a special kind of feed-forward [[neural network]]s with a bottle-neck hidden layer.<ref>Hongbing Hu, Stephen A.

In practice, the [[covariance]] (and sometimes the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]]) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the data is constructed and the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvectors]] on this matrix are computed. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system, because they often contribute the vast majority of the system's energy, especially in low-dimensional systems. Still, this must be proven on a case-by-case basis as not all systems exhibit this behavior. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} {{Why|date=September 2017}}. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.\n\n===Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)===\n{{main article|Non-negative matrix factorization}}\n\nNMF decomposes a non-negative matrix to the product of two non-negative ones, which has been a promising tool in fields where only non-negative signals exist.<ref name=\"lee-seung\">{{Cite journal\n | author = Daniel D.

These techniques construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA.\n\nMore recently, techniques have been proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel using [[semidefinite programming]]. The most prominent example of such a technique is [[maximum variance unfolding]] (MVU). The central idea of MVU is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors (in the inner product space), while maximizing the distances between points that are not nearest neighbors.\n\nAn alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the minimization of a cost function that measures differences between distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such techniques include: classical [[multidimensional scaling]], which is identical to PCA; [[Isomap]], which uses geodesic distances in the data space; [[diffusion map]]s, which use diffusion distances in the data space; [[t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding]] (t-SNE), which minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points; and curvilinear component analysis.\n\nA different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the use of [[autoencoder]]s, a special kind of feed-forward [[neural network]]s with a bottle-neck hidden layer.<ref>Hongbing Hu, Stephen A.

Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to [[glycoprotein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  In neonates, [[Opsonin|opsonic]] activity and the ability to activate the [[complement cascade]] is very limited.  For example, the mean level of [[Apolipoprotein C3<!--Is this correct?-->|C3]] in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. [[Phagocytosis|Phagocytic]] activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished [[Downregulation and upregulation|up-regulation]] of [[integrin]] and [[selectin]] receptors, which limit the ability of [[neutrophil]]s to interact with [[Cell adhesion molecule|adhesion molecule]]s in the [[endothelium]]. Their [[monocyte]]s are slow and have a reduced [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity.  Although, the number of total [[lymphocyte]]s is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. [[Antigen-presenting cell]]s in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T&nbsp;cells.  Also, T&nbsp;cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of [[cytokine]]s like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months, but their response is usually short-lived and of low [[Affinity (pharmacology)<!--Is this correct?-->|affinity]].<ref name=\"Jaspan et al\"/>  These antibodies can also produce a negative response.  If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response.

However, the similarity between some antigens can lead to false positives and other errors in such tests by antibodies cross-reacting with antigens that aren't exact matches.<ref name=\"pmid1993317\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller JJ, Valdes R | title = Approaches to minimizing interference by cross-reacting molecules in immunoassays | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 144\u201353 | date = February 1991 | pmid = 1993317 | doi = 10.1093/clinchem/37.2.144 }}</ref>\n\n== Cancer immunology ==\n{{main|Cancer immunology}}\n\nThe study of the interaction of the immune system with cancer cells can lead to diagnostic tests and therapies with which to find and fight cancer.

Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to [[glycoprotein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  In neonates, [[Opsonin|opsonic]] activity and the ability to activate the [[complement cascade]] is very limited.  For example, the mean level of [[Apolipoprotein C3<!--Is this correct?-->|C3]] in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. [[Phagocytosis|Phagocytic]] activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished [[Downregulation and upregulation|up-regulation]] of [[integrin]] and [[selectin]] receptors, which limit the ability of [[neutrophil]]s to interact with [[Cell adhesion molecule|adhesion molecule]]s in the [[endothelium]]. Their [[monocyte]]s are slow and have a reduced [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity.  Although, the number of total [[lymphocyte]]s is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. [[Antigen-presenting cell]]s in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T&nbsp;cells.  Also, T&nbsp;cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of [[cytokine]]s like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] often lays its eggs on certain toxic [[Asclepias|milkweed]] species when infected with parasites.
