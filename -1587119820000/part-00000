{"title_page": "High-speed steel", "text_new": "{{short description|Subset of tool steels}}\n{{Steels}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}\n'''High-speed steel''' ('''HSS''' or '''HS''') is a subset of [[tool steel]]s, commonly used as [[cutting tool material]].\n\nIt is often used in power-saw blades and [[drill bit]]s. It is superior to the older high-[[Plain-carbon steel|carbon steel]] tools used extensively through the 1940s in that it can withstand higher temperatures without losing its temper (hardness). This property allows HSS to [[Speeds and feeds|cut faster]] than high carbon steel, hence the name ''high-speed steel''. At room temperature, in their generally recommended heat treatment, HSS grades generally display high hardness (above [[Rockwell hardness]] 60) and abrasion resistance (generally linked to [[tungsten]] and [[vanadium]] content often used in HSS) compared with common [[carbon steel|carbon]] and [[tool steel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1868 English metallurgist [[Robert Forester Mushet]] developed [[Mushet steel]], considered the forerunner of modern high-speed steels. It consisted of 2% [[carbon]] (C), 2.5% [[manganese]] (Mn), and 7% [[tungsten]] (W). The major advantage of this steel was that it hardened when air cooled from a temperature at which most steels had to be quenched for hardening. Over the next 30 years, the most significant change was the replacement of [[manganese]] (Mn) with [[chromium]] (Cr).<ref name=\"Boccalini\"/>\n\nIn 1899 and 1900, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and Maunsel White, working with a team of assistants at the [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Company]] at [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], US, performed a series of experiments with heat treating existing high-quality tool steels, such as Mushet steel, heating them to much higher temperatures than were typically considered desirable in the industry.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kanigel\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency\n  | publisher = Viking Penguin\n  | year = 1997\n  | isbn = 0-670-86402-1\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/onebestwayfreder00robe\n  }}\n</ref><ref name=\"Misa 1995\">{{cite book|title=A Nation of Steel: The Making of Modern America 1865\u20131925|url=https://archive.org/details/nationofsteelmak00misa|url-access=registration|last=Misa|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0801860522|location=Baltimore and London|pages=|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Their experiments were characterised by a scientific empiricism in that many different combinations were made and tested, with no regard for conventional wisdom or alchemic recipes, and detailed records kept of each batch.

This fertile valley has been important since the antiquity - its [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name was ''Vallis Aurea'', meaning \"[[gold]]en valley\".\n\nThe valley is formed by the Slavonian mountains of [[Po\u017ee\u0161ka Gora]], [[Psunj]], [[Papuk]], [[Krndija]] and [[Dilj]].\n\nTwo [[State roads in Croatia|state roads]] run [[Road concurrency|concurrently]] through the city: the [[D38 (Croatia)|D38]] [[Pakrac]] \u2014 Po\u017eega \u2014 [[Pleternica]] \u2014 [[\u0110akovo]] and the [[D51 (Croatia)|D51]] [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]] \u2014 Po\u017eega \u2014 [[Na\u0161ice]], as well as a [[railroad]]: [[Nova Kapela]]/[[Batrina]] \u2014 [[Pleternica]] \u2014 Po\u017eega \u2014 [[Velika, Croatia|Velika]].\n\n==Demographics==\n\nThe total population of the city administrative area is 26,248, in the following [[naselje|settlements]]:<ref name=\"census2011\"/>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alaginci]], population 198\n* [[Bankovci, Po\u017eega-Slavonia County|Bankovci]], population 109\n* [[Crkveni Vrhovci]], population 30\n* [[\u0106osine Laze]], population 27\n* [[Dervi\u0161aga]], population 890\n* [[Donji Emovci]], population 181\n* [[Dr\u0161kovci]], population 411\n* [[Emova\u010dki Lug]], population 32\n* [[Golobrdci]], population 332\n* [[Gornji Emovci]], population 138\n* [[Gradski Vrhovci]], population 46\n* [[Komu\u0161ina]], population 82\n* [[Krivaj, Po\u017eega-Slavonia County|Krivaj]], population 79\n* [[Kunovci, Croatia|Kunovci]], population 88\n* [[Laze Prnjavor]], population 10\n* [[Marindvor (Po\u017eega)|Marindvor]], population 116\n* [[Mihaljevci]], population 752\n* [[Nova Lipa, Croatia|Nova Lipa]], population 88\n* [[Novi Mihaljevci]], population 291\n* [[Novi \u0160titnjak]], population 136\n* [[Novo Selo, Po\u017eega-Slavonia County|Novo Selo]], population 432\n* Po\u017eega, population 19,506\n* [[Seoci, Croatia|Seoci]], population 108\n* [[Stara Lipa, Croatia|Stara Lipa]], population 213\n* [[\u0160eovci]], population 121\n* [[\u0160krabutnik]], population 22\n* [[\u0160titnjak]], population 54\n* [[Turni\u0107]], population 88\n* [[Ugarci, Croatia|Ugarci]], population 57\n* [[Vasine Laze]], population 29\n* [[Vidovci]], population 1,582\n{{div col end}}\n\nBy ethnicity, the population is 93.24% [[Croats]], 4.66% [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], 0.56% undeclared, 0.38% [[Albanians]], 0.15% [[Czechs of Croatia|Czechs]], and others.<ref>{{Croatian Census 2011|E|11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Medieval pozega.jpg|thumb|left|Fortress and city of Po\u017eega (13th century)]]\n[[File:Pozega - bishop palace.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop's Palace]]\nThe first mention of the city of Po\u017eega is found in the [[Gesta Hungarorum]], by an anonymous notary of [[B\u00e9la III]] (1172\u20131196) where he mentions the conquest of three forts in [[Slavonia]] - as the area between rivers [[Danube]] and [[Sutla]] was then called: [[Zagreb]], Vlco ([[Vukovar]]) and Posega. The fortress of Po\u017eega, an elongated hexagonal fortification located on a hill in the present-day city center, was probably built during the 11th century, although the first documents that clearly mention Po\u017eega county date from 1210, while the city of Po\u017eega was documented for the first time in a charter of [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] on January 11, 1227.\n\nPo\u017eega was originally the residential estate of the Croatian-Hungarian queen and was exempt from the authority of the viceroy and the county. Although no such charter survives, the privileges that citizens enjoyed fully corresponded to a free royal city.\n\nThe fortress doesn't exist anymore, and the irregularly-shaped central city square is Romanic in nature. Only fragments of walls remain to remind that there once stood a fortress. The remaining monuments from that age are the Church of St. Lawrence (first mentioned in 1303), and the Church of the Holy Spirit (built in 1235).\n\nBy the late 14th century, the city started to decline economically due to insecurity from Ottoman raids. In the 15th century, city walls were built, replacing a moat that existed before. This proved an insufficient defense as the Turks seized Po\u017eega in 1537.\n\nDuring the 150-year-long Ottoman rule, Po\u017eega was seat of a [[Sanjak of Pojega|Sanjak of Po\u017eega]] and given certain prominence. After a considerable economic decline, in 1537, at the time of the Ottoman conquest, Po\u017eega reportedly had 110 houses and 15 businesses. However, by 1579, there were 160 craftsmen in Po\u017eega as a result of improved security and an increase in population.\n\nThe death of [[Hasan Predojevi\u0107]] the Po\u017eega Sanjak [[Bey]] in the [[Battle of Sisak]] in 1593, marked the first Ottoman defeat in Europe, and after years of steady decline, Ottoman rule grew weaker until Po\u017eega was finally liberated on 12 March 1688 by citizens led by friar Luka Ibri\u0161imovi\u0107. This day is now celebrated as the day of the city.\n\nAfter the liberation, Po\u017eega came under [[Habsburg]] rule, and in 1745, Po\u017eega county was restored and the city thus returned to the authority of Croatian viceroy. Po\u017eega underwent a period of vigorous development: In 1699, a grammar school opened - only the fifth in Croatia. In 1727, [[Jesuits]] built a theatre, and in 1740, the city's first pharmacy. There was also a philosophical college for Franciscan novices - the first such institution in Slavonia since the Ottoman rule. Finally, the Academia Posegana opened in 1760, placing Po\u017eega, along with Zagreb, among the first Croatian centres of highest education.\n\nIn 1765, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] granted Po\u017eega a [[royal free city]] charter and supported the construction of the present-day [[Po\u017eega cathedral|Cathedral of St.Teresa of \u00c1vila]].\n\nIn 1847, Po\u017eega was the first city in Croatia to introduce the Croatian language in official use, and the achievements of its notable citizens earned it the nickname of \"Slavonian Athens\".\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, Po\u017eega was the seat of the [[Po\u017eega County]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]].\n\nFrom 1941 to 1945, Po\u017eega was part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. During this period [[war crimes]] were committed against the [[Serb]] and [[Jew]]ish population, allegedly under former police chief [[Milivoj A\u0161ner]].\n<ref name=\"iht\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/europe/28iht-hungary.2970014.html Nazi hunters identify convicted war criminal]\", Nicholas Wood, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', September 28, 2006</ref>  Also among the war-time and post-wartime casualties were at least 301 [[Germans of Croatia|Germans]].<ref>Vladimir Geiger.

Furthermore, in the footsteps of its tradition as an educational center as well as a church center, Po\u017eega became a [[Diocese|diocesan]] see in 1997, and a graduate-degree college was opened in 1998.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:12.02.97 Po\u017eega 7121.019 & 7121.022 (11740962795).jpg|thumb|right|Po\u017eega railway station in 1997]]\nChief occupations include farming, viticulture, livestock breeding, metal-processing ([[foundry]], machines and tractors, household [[Major appliance|appliance]]s), foodstuffs (chocolate, sweets and drinks), textiles (ready-made), wood and timber, building material (bricks, roof tiles) and printing industries.\n\n==Festivities and events==\nThe city has an 800-year-old cultural and historical heritage. Its carefully cherished traditions underlie the tourist development of Po\u017eega.\n\nThe central town square with a number of nice buildings (the church of the [[Holy Spirit]], the [[Franciscan]] monastery, the Town House, etc.) and a [[plague column]] is one of the most beautiful squares in Croatia.\n\nPo\u017eega hosts a number of traditional cultural events and performances. ''Grgurevo'' or St. Gregory's Day is a traditional show of canons and mortars, exhibited on the central square (12 March). The event includes the mortar fire in Po\u017eega [[vineyard]]s, which symbolizes the chasing of the [[Ottomans]] from the region and commemorates the victory over the Turks on Sokolovac Hill in 1688. The [[Croatian Minute Movie Cup]] &mdash; an international festival featuring one-minute-long [[Film|movie]]s &mdash; and the national dog show are held in May The events in June are St. John's Bonfire (21 June), ''Kulenijada'' &mdash; a special event dedicated to presentation and tasting of the very best [[kulen]] (Slavonian [[paprika]]-flavoured sausages), served with quality local wines.\n\nThe events in September are ''Fi\u0161ijada'' (fishing and preparing of Slavonian-style fish specialities) and the important music festival Golden Strings of Slavonia (first weekend in September). This event is a contest of [[folk music]] performers and singers but also includes other events (grape harvest, [[beauty contest]], the most \"swaggering\" peasant girl, national costumes show, etc.). [[Organ (music)|Organ]] music evenings are organized on the occasion of the town's day and in commemoration of its patroness, St. Teresa of Avila (15 October). There is a quiz contest each April, [http://kvizoljupci.wixsite.com/sova \"Spring Open Vallis Aurea\" (SOVA)], organized by the [http://kvizoljupci.wixsite.com/kviz Quiz lover's club]. SOVA arouse from Pub quiz, a popular event that is usually organized on Fridays bi-weekly, and become probably the largest independent quiz contest in the country.\n\n== Education ==\nThere are three primary schools and seven secondary schools in Po\u017eega. \n\nThe Gymnasium in Po\u017eega was founded in 1699 and it is classified as one of the oldest educational institutions in the Republic of Croatia. In the period from 1761 to 1776 it was aligned among high schools under the name of Academia Posegana, with two faculties \u2013 the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Theology. It was attended by many famous people whose work is weaved into the scientific and cultural identity of Croatia and the Croatian people: o.

The fortress of Po\u017eega, an elongated hexagonal fortification located on a hill in the present-day city center, was probably built during the 11th century, although the first documents that clearly mention Po\u017eega county date from 1210, while the city of Po\u017eega was documented for the first time in a charter of [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] on January 11, 1227.\n\nPo\u017eega was originally the residential estate of the Croatian-Hungarian queen and was exempt from the authority of the viceroy and the county. Although no such charter survives, the privileges that citizens enjoyed fully corresponded to a free royal city.\n\nThe fortress doesn't exist anymore, and the irregularly-shaped central city square is Romanic in nature. Only fragments of walls remain to remind that there once stood a fortress. The remaining monuments from that age are the Church of St. Lawrence (first mentioned in 1303), and the Church of the Holy Spirit (built in 1235).\n\nBy the late 14th century, the city started to decline economically due to insecurity from Ottoman raids. In the 15th century, city walls were built, replacing a moat that existed before. This proved an insufficient defense as the Turks seized Po\u017eega in 1537.\n\nDuring the 150-year-long Ottoman rule, Po\u017eega was seat of a [[Sanjak of Pojega|Sanjak of Po\u017eega]] and given certain prominence. After a considerable economic decline, in 1537, at the time of the Ottoman conquest, Po\u017eega reportedly had 110 houses and 15 businesses. However, by 1579, there were 160 craftsmen in Po\u017eega as a result of improved security and an increase in population.\n\nThe death of [[Hasan Predojevi\u0107]] the Po\u017eega Sanjak [[Bey]] in the [[Battle of Sisak]] in 1593, marked the first Ottoman defeat in Europe, and after years of steady decline, Ottoman rule grew weaker until Po\u017eega was finally liberated on 12 March 1688 by citizens led by friar Luka Ibri\u0161imovi\u0107. This day is now celebrated as the day of the city.\n\nAfter the liberation, Po\u017eega came under [[Habsburg]] rule, and in 1745, Po\u017eega county was restored and the city thus returned to the authority of Croatian viceroy. Po\u017eega underwent a period of vigorous development: In 1699, a grammar school opened - only the fifth in Croatia. In 1727, [[Jesuits]] built a theatre, and in 1740, the city's first pharmacy. There was also a philosophical college for Franciscan novices - the first such institution in Slavonia since the Ottoman rule. Finally, the Academia Posegana opened in 1760, placing Po\u017eega, along with Zagreb, among the first Croatian centres of highest education.\n\nIn 1765, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] granted Po\u017eega a [[royal free city]] charter and supported the construction of the present-day [[Po\u017eega cathedral|Cathedral of St.Teresa of \u00c1vila]].\n\nIn 1847, Po\u017eega was the first city in Croatia to introduce the Croatian language in official use, and the achievements of its notable citizens earned it the nickname of \"Slavonian Athens\".\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, Po\u017eega was the seat of the [[Po\u017eega County]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]].\n\nFrom 1941 to 1945, Po\u017eega was part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. During this period [[war crimes]] were committed against the [[Serb]] and [[Jew]]ish population, allegedly under former police chief [[Milivoj A\u0161ner]].\n<ref name=\"iht\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/europe/28iht-hungary.2970014.html Nazi hunters identify convicted war criminal]\", Nicholas Wood, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', September 28, 2006</ref>  Also among the war-time and post-wartime casualties were at least 301 [[Germans of Croatia|Germans]].<ref>Vladimir Geiger.

Furthermore, in the footsteps of its tradition as an educational center as well as a church center, Po\u017eega became a [[Diocese|diocesan]] see in 1997, and a graduate-degree college was opened in 1998.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:12.02.97 Po\u017eega 7121.019 & 7121.022 (11740962795).jpg|thumb|right|Po\u017eega railway station in 1997]]\nChief occupations include farming, viticulture, livestock breeding, metal-processing ([[foundry]], machines and tractors, household [[Major appliance|appliance]]s), foodstuffs (chocolate, sweets and drinks), textiles (ready-made), wood and timber, building material (bricks, roof tiles) and printing industries.\n\n==Festivities and events==\nThe city has an 800-year-old cultural and historical heritage. Its carefully cherished traditions underlie the tourist development of Po\u017eega.\n\nThe central town square with a number of nice buildings (the church of the [[Holy Spirit]], the [[Franciscan]] monastery, the Town House, etc.) and a [[plague column]] is one of the most beautiful squares in Croatia.\n\nPo\u017eega hosts a number of traditional cultural events and performances. ''Grgurevo'' or St. Gregory's Day is a traditional show of canons and mortars, exhibited on the central square (12 March). The event includes the mortar fire in Po\u017eega [[vineyard]]s, which symbolizes the chasing of the [[Ottomans]] from the region and commemorates the victory over the Turks on Sokolovac Hill in 1688. The [[Croatian Minute Movie Cup]] &mdash; an international festival featuring one-minute-long [[Film|movie]]s &mdash; and the national dog show are held in May The events in June are St. John's Bonfire (21 June), ''Kulenijada'' &mdash; a special event dedicated to presentation and tasting of the very best [[kulen]] (Slavonian [[paprika]]-flavoured sausages), served with quality local wines.\n\nThe events in September are ''Fi\u0161ijada'' (fishing and preparing of Slavonian-style fish specialities) and the important music festival Golden Strings of Slavonia (first weekend in September). This event is a contest of [[folk music]] performers and singers but also includes other events (grape harvest, [[beauty contest]], the most \"swaggering\" peasant girl, national costumes show, etc.). [[Organ (music)|Organ]] music evenings are organized on the occasion of the town's day and in commemoration of its patroness, St. Teresa of Avila (15 October). There is a quiz contest each April, [http://kvizoljupci.wixsite.com/sova \"Spring Open Vallis Aurea\" (SOVA)], organized by the [http://kvizoljupci.wixsite.com/kviz Quiz lover's club]. SOVA arouse from Pub quiz, a popular event that is usually organized on Fridays bi-weekly, and become probably the largest independent quiz contest in the country.\n\n== Education ==\nThere are three primary schools and seven secondary schools in Po\u017eega. \n\nThe Gymnasium in Po\u017eega was founded in 1699 and it is classified as one of the oldest educational institutions in the Republic of Croatia. In the period from 1761 to 1776 it was aligned among high schools under the name of Academia Posegana, with two faculties \u2013 the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Theology. It was attended by many famous people whose work is weaved into the scientific and cultural identity of Croatia and the Croatian people: o.

Son of a former Telugu [[Palegaadu]] Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ''[[Vadde Obanna]]'' were at the heart of the rebellion against  [[Company rule in India|British]] in 1847, where 5,000 [[peasant|peasants]] rose up against the [[British East India Company ]] in [[Kurnool district]], [[Rayalaseema]] Region of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the [[ryotwari]] system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished.<ref name=\"venugopal\">{{cite journal |last=Reddy |first=K.

He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/> His first wife was Siddamma.\n\n==Causes of rebellion ==\nThe [[East India Company|EIC]]'s introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 [[Permanent Settlement]], which had first been enacted in [[Bengal Presidency]] ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nThe Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system \"represented the decadent social order\", were in many cases \"upstarts\" and \"were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages\". These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the [[Polygar Wars]]. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nThe changes, which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximise revenue, deprived village headmen and other higher-status people of their role as revenue collectors and position as landholders, while also impacting on lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished. The population came to the view that the British were taking their wealth and that those who were dependent on the traditional system no longer had a means of making a living. As the old order collapsed into disarray, the once-authoritative Polygars, including Narasimha Reddy, became the focus of attention from sufferers, whose pleas fell on deaf British ears. The Polygars saw a chance to mobilize peasant opposition both for genuine social reasons.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nNarasimha Reddy's own objections too was based on their outcomes. Compared to the Polygar of Nossam, the pension awarded to his family upon their dispossession was paltry and the authorities refused to increase it by redistributing some of the Nossam monies when that latter family became extinct in 1821. At the same time, some of his relatives were facing proposals for further reductions in their land rights, including by a reform of the village policing system.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Rebellion==\nThings came to a head in 1846 when the British authorities assumed land rights previously held by various people who had died in the villages of Goodladurty, Koilkuntla and Nossum. Encouraged by the discontent of others, Reddy became the figurehead for an uprising.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nAn armed group, initially comprising those dispossessed of inam lands around Koilakuntla, was led by Reddy's Right-hand man Vadde Obanna in July 1846. The Acting Collector for the area Lord Cochrane, believed that Reddy had material support from fellow pensioners in [[Hyderabad]] and [[Kurnool]], whose land rights had also been appropriated. The group soon attracted support from the peasantry and was reported by British authorities to have rampaged in Koilkuntla, looting the treasury there and evading the police before killing several officers at Mittapally. They also plundered [[Rudravaram, Kurnool district|Rudravaram]] before moving to an area near to Almore, pursued by the British military forces who then surrounded them.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nA battle between Obanna's 5000-strong band and a much smaller British contingent then took place, with around 200 of the rebels being killed and others captured before they were able to break out in the direction of Kotakota, [[Giddalur]] where Reddy's family were situated. Having collected his family, he and the rest of the rebels moved into the [[Nallamala Hills]]. The British offered incentives for information regarding the rebels, who were again surrounded amidst reports that unrest was now growing in other villages of the area. In a further skirmish between the rebels and the British, who had sent for reinforcements, 40\u201350 rebels were killed and 90 were captured, including Reddy. Although there was no evidence of Obanna's capture, he most possibly was also a captive along with his leader.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nWarrants were issued for the arrest of nearly 1,000 of the rebels, of which 412 were released without charge. A further 273 were bailed and 112 were convicted. Reddy, too, was convicted and in his case received the death penalty. On 22 February 1847, he was executed in Koilkuntla in front of a silent crowd of over 2000 people who were unhappy with the proceedings. Although he was hanged but his execution failed and before dying he killed Lieutenant Campbell and three soldiers.a.<ref name=\"venugopal\"/>\n\nDue to this the British kept his head on the fort wall in public view until 1877.

Bears tend to have hairy bodies and [[facial hair]]; some are [[overweight|heavy-set]]; some project an image of working-class [[masculinity]] in their [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and appearance, though none of these are requirements or unique indicators. The bear concept can function as an identity, an affiliation, and an ideal to live up to. There is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear. Some state that self-identifying as a bear is the only requirement, while others argue that bears must have certain physical characteristics, such as a hairy chest and face, a large body, or a certain mode of dress and behavior.\n\nBears are almost always [[gay]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] men; [[transgender]] men (regardless of their sexuality) and those who shun labels for [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]] are increasingly included within bear communities.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for older, hairier, sometimes heavier gay and bisexual men, and members often contribute to their local gay communities through fundraising and other functions. Bear events are common in heavily gay communities.\n\nThe [[Bear flag (gay culture)|International Bear Brotherhood Flag]] was designed in 1995 by Craig Byrnes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |title=Flag History |publisher=Bearmfg.com |accessdate=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211094128/http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |archive-date=2012-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Bisexuality===\n{{Main|Bisexual pride flag}}\n[[File:Bi flag.svg|thumb|right|150px|Bisexual pride, created in 1998|alt=Magenta, lavender, and blue stripes]]\n\nFirst unveiled on 5 December 1998,<ref name=\"biflag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=History, Bi Activism, Free Graphics |publisher=BiFlag.com |date=1998-12-05 |accessdate=2012-01-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204070907/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp | archive-date=2012-02-04 | url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[bisexual pride flag]] was designed by Michael Page to represent and increase visibility of bisexuals in the LGBT community and society as a whole. This rectangular flag consists of a broad magenta stripe at the top, a broad stripe in blue at the bottom, and a narrower deep lavender band occupying the central fifth.\n\nPage describes the meaning of the pink, lavender, and blue (ratio 2:1:2) flag as this: \"The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only (gay and lesbian). The blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only (straight) and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).\" He also describes the flag's meaning in deeper terms, stating \"The key to understanding the symbolism of the Bisexual pride flag is to know that the purple pixels of color blend unnoticeably into both the pink and blue, just as in the 'real world,' where bi people blend unnoticeably into both the gay/lesbian and straight communities.<ref name=\"mashableglossary\" />\n\nThe blue and pink overlapping triangle symbol represents [[bisexuality]] and bi pride. The origin of the symbol, sometimes facetiously referred to as the \"biangles\", is largely unknown, however the colors of bisexuality originate from this symbol: pink for attraction to women, blue for attraction to men, and lavender for attraction to both, as well as a reference to queerness.<ref name=\"mashableglossary\" />\n\n===Intersex===\n{{Main|Intersex flag}}\n[[File:Intersex flag.svg|thumb|left|150px|alt=A yellow background with a purple circle in the middle, representing intersex people.|[[Intersex flag|Intersex pride]], created in 2013]]\n\n[[Intersex]] people are those who do not exhibit all the biological characteristics of male or female, or exhibit a combination of characteristics, at birth.

Money was raised for the ads, and they began running on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]'s Green Line by December 3rd, 1974, and ran there until February of 1975.

Bears tend to have hairy bodies and [[facial hair]]; some are [[overweight|heavy-set]]; some project an image of working-class [[masculinity]] in their [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and appearance, though none of these are requirements or unique indicators. The bear concept can function as an identity, an affiliation, and an ideal to live up to. There is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear. Some state that self-identifying as a bear is the only requirement, while others argue that bears must have certain physical characteristics, such as a hairy chest and face, a large body, or a certain mode of dress and behavior.\n\nBears are almost always [[gay]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] men; [[transgender]] men (regardless of their sexuality) and those who shun labels for [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]] are increasingly included within bear communities.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for older, hairier, sometimes heavier gay and bisexual men, and members often contribute to their local gay communities through fundraising and other functions. Bear events are common in heavily gay communities.\n\nThe [[Bear flag (gay culture)|International Bear Brotherhood Flag]] was designed in 1995 by Craig Byrnes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |title=Flag History |publisher=Bearmfg.com |accessdate=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211094128/http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |archive-date=2012-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Bisexuality===\n{{Main|Bisexual pride flag}}\n[[File:Bi flag.svg|thumb|right|150px|Bisexual pride, created in 1998|alt=Magenta, lavender, and blue stripes]]\n\nFirst unveiled on 5 December 1998,<ref name=\"biflag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=History, Bi Activism, Free Graphics |publisher=BiFlag.com |date=1998-12-05 |accessdate=2012-01-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204070907/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp | archive-date=2012-02-04 | url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[bisexual pride flag]] was designed by Michael Page to represent and increase visibility of bisexuals in the LGBT community and society as a whole. This rectangular flag consists of a broad magenta stripe at the top, a broad stripe in blue at the bottom, and a narrower deep lavender band occupying the central fifth.\n\nPage describes the meaning of the pink, lavender, and blue (ratio 2:1:2) flag as this: \"The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only (gay and lesbian). The blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only (straight) and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).\" He also describes the flag's meaning in deeper terms, stating \"The key to understanding the symbolism of the Bisexual pride flag is to know that the purple pixels of color blend unnoticeably into both the pink and blue, just as in the 'real world,' where bi people blend unnoticeably into both the gay/lesbian and straight communities.<ref name=\"mashableglossary\" />\n\nThe blue and pink overlapping triangle symbol represents [[bisexuality]] and bi pride. The origin of the symbol, sometimes facetiously referred to as the \"biangles\", is largely unknown, however the colors of bisexuality originate from this symbol: pink for attraction to women, blue for attraction to men, and lavender for attraction to both, as well as a reference to queerness.<ref name=\"mashableglossary\" />\n\n===Intersex===\n{{Main|Intersex flag}}\n[[File:Intersex flag.svg|thumb|left|150px|alt=A yellow background with a purple circle in the middle, representing intersex people.|[[Intersex flag|Intersex pride]], created in 2013]]\n\n[[Intersex]] people are those who do not exhibit all the biological characteristics of male or female, or exhibit a combination of characteristics, at birth.
