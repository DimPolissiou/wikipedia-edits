Although the [[Holocaust]] deeply affected the Jewish community, killing some 80% of the some 80,000 Jews at time present in Amsterdam, since then the community has managed to rebuild a vibrant and living Jewish life for its approximately 15,000 present members.

Many Sephardi (Jews from the Iberian Peninsula) had been expelled from [[Spain]] in 1492 after the fall of Muslim [[Granada]]. Those that moved to [[Portugal]] were forced to leave in 1497, where they were given the choice between conversion to Catholicism or death penalty on the grounds of heresy.\n\nFrom 1497, others remained in the [[Iberian peninsula]], practising Judaism secretly in their homes. The newly independent Dutch provinces provided an ideal opportunity for these [[crypto-Jews]] to re-establish themselves and practise their religion openly, and they migrated, most notably to Amsterdam. Collectively, they brought economic growth and influence to the city as they established an international trading hub in Amsterdam during the 17th century, the so-called [[Dutch Golden Age]]. Perhaps the most notable example of Sephardic Jews in Amsterdam are the [[Curiel family]], namely Jeromino Nunes da Costa (alias [[Moses Curiel]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-abas/I1875.php|title=Mose Curiel Abas (alias: Jeronimo Nunes Da Costa) (1620-1697) \u00bb Stamboom Abas \u00bb Genealogy Online|last=Abas|first=W.|website=Genealogy Online|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> son of [[Jacob Curiel]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL|first=JONATHAN I.|date=1984|title=AN AMSTERDAM JEWISH MERCHANT OF THE GOLDEN AGE: JERONIMO NUNES DA COSTA (1620-1697), AGENT OF PORTUGAL IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC|journal=Studia Rosenthaliana|volume=18|issue=1|pages=21\u201340|issn=0039-3347|jstor=41442146}}</ref> Curiel was the single largest financial contributor to the building of the [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Portuguese Synagogue]] in Amsterdam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/amsterdam-qr/centrum-oost-de-plantage/woonhuis-familie-nunes-da-costa|title=Woonhuis familie Nunes da Costa (Residence of the Nunes Da Costa family)|website=www.iamsterdam.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> \n\nIn 1593, [[Marrano]] Jews arrived in Amsterdam after having been refused admission to Middelburg and Haarlem. These Jews of [[Converso]] descent were important merchants, and persons of great ability. Their expertise, it can be stated, contributed materially to the prosperity of the Netherlands. They became strenuous supporters of the contender [[House of Orange]], and were in return protected by the Stadholder. At this time, commerce in Holland was increasing; a period of development had arrived, particularly for Amsterdam, to which Jews had carried their goods and from which they maintained their relations with foreign lands. Quite new for the Netherlands, they also held connections with the [[Levant]], [[Morocco]] and the Caribbean Antilles.\n\nThe formal independence from Spain of the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces]] (1581), theoretically opened the door to public practice of Judaism. Yet only in 1603 did a gathering take place that was licensed by the city.  The three original congregations formed in the first two decades of the 17th century merged in 1639 to form a united Sephardic congregation.\n\n==Ashkenazim==\nThe first [[Ashkenazim]] who arrived in Amsterdam were refugees from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in [[Poland]] and the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers soon swelled, eventually outnumbering the Sephardic Jews at the end of the 17th century; by 1674, some 5,000 Ashkenazi Jews were living in Amsterdam, while 2,500 Sephardic Jews called Amsterdam their home.<ref name=\"Ashkenazi Jews in Amsterdam\">[http://www.jhm.nl/jhm/documenten/InleidingEvV%20cd.eng.pdf Ashkenazi Jews in Amsterdam].

Many Sephardi (Jews from the Iberian Peninsula) had been expelled from [[Spain]] in 1492 after the fall of Muslim [[Granada]]. Those that moved to [[Portugal]] were forced to leave in 1497, where they were given the choice between conversion to Catholicism or death penalty on the grounds of heresy.\n\nFrom 1497, others remained in the [[Iberian peninsula]], practising Judaism secretly in their homes. The newly independent Dutch provinces provided an ideal opportunity for these [[crypto-Jews]] to re-establish themselves and practise their religion openly, and they migrated, most notably to Amsterdam. Collectively, they brought economic growth and influence to the city as they established an international trading hub in Amsterdam during the 17th century, the so-called [[Dutch Golden Age]]. Perhaps the most notable example of Sephardic Jews in Amsterdam are the [[Curiel family]], namely Jeromino Nunes da Costa (alias [[Moses Curiel]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-abas/I1875.php|title=Mose Curiel Abas (alias: Jeronimo Nunes Da Costa) (1620-1697) \u00bb Stamboom Abas \u00bb Genealogy Online|last=Abas|first=W.|website=Genealogy Online|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> son of [[Jacob Curiel]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL|first=JONATHAN I.|date=1984|title=AN AMSTERDAM JEWISH MERCHANT OF THE GOLDEN AGE: JERONIMO NUNES DA COSTA (1620-1697), AGENT OF PORTUGAL IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC|journal=Studia Rosenthaliana|volume=18|issue=1|pages=21\u201340|issn=0039-3347|jstor=41442146}}</ref> Curiel was the single largest financial contributor to the building of the [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Portuguese Synagogue]] in Amsterdam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/amsterdam-qr/centrum-oost-de-plantage/woonhuis-familie-nunes-da-costa|title=Woonhuis familie Nunes da Costa (Residence of the Nunes Da Costa family)|website=www.iamsterdam.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> \n\nIn 1593, [[Marrano]] Jews arrived in Amsterdam after having been refused admission to Middelburg and Haarlem. These Jews of [[Converso]] descent were important merchants, and persons of great ability. Their expertise, it can be stated, contributed materially to the prosperity of the Netherlands. They became strenuous supporters of the contender [[House of Orange]], and were in return protected by the Stadholder. At this time, commerce in Holland was increasing; a period of development had arrived, particularly for Amsterdam, to which Jews had carried their goods and from which they maintained their relations with foreign lands. Quite new for the Netherlands, they also held connections with the [[Levant]], [[Morocco]] and the Caribbean Antilles.\n\nThe formal independence from Spain of the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces]] (1581), theoretically opened the door to public practice of Judaism. Yet only in 1603 did a gathering take place that was licensed by the city.  The three original congregations formed in the first two decades of the 17th century merged in 1639 to form a united Sephardic congregation.\n\n==Ashkenazim==\nThe first [[Ashkenazim]] who arrived in Amsterdam were refugees from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in [[Poland]] and the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers soon swelled, eventually outnumbering the Sephardic Jews at the end of the 17th century; by 1674, some 5,000 Ashkenazi Jews were living in Amsterdam, while 2,500 Sephardic Jews called Amsterdam their home.<ref name=\"Ashkenazi Jews in Amsterdam\">[http://www.jhm.nl/jhm/documenten/InleidingEvV%20cd.eng.pdf Ashkenazi Jews in Amsterdam].

For a long time, the Ashkenazi community was strongly focused on Central and Eastern Europe, the region where most of the Dutch Ashkenazi originated from.

[[Naples]], albeit being known today as the city of coffee, has seen it later, probably through the ships coming in the ports of [[Sicily]] and Naples itself. Some date the neapolitan discovery of coffee back to 1614, when the composer, explorer and musicologist [[Pietro Della Valle]] sent news from the [[Holy Land]], in his letters to the dear friend, physician, poet, Greek scholar and Mario Schipano and his gathering of intellectuals, of a drink (called [[Turkish coffee|kahve]])<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=SKBfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA352&dq=mario+schipano+kahve&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrxpqWktThAhVP6qQKHcJFAMQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=mario%20schipano%20kahve&f=false|title=Origini|last=Bausilio|first=Giovanni|date=2018-06-11|publisher=Key Editore|isbn=9788827901380|language=it}}</ref> the Arab Muslims brewed in hot pots. Some believe coffee arrived in Naples earlier, from [[Salerno]] and its [[Schola Medica Salernitana]], where the plant came to be used for its medicinal properties between the XIV and XV century. Celebrated by neapolitan art, literature, music and daily social life, coffee soon became a protagonist in Naples, where it was prepared with great care in the \"cuccumella\", the typical neapolitan filter coffee pot derived by the invention of the parisian Morize in 1819. Neapolitan artisans came in touch with it when brought, once again through the sea commercial routes, to the Port of Naples. An indication of the approach of neapolitans to coffee as a social drink, is the practice of the [[Caff\u00e8 sospeso|suspended coffee]] (the act of paying in advance for a coffee to be consumed by the next customer) invented there and defined by the neapolitan philosopher and writer [[Luciano De Crescenzo]] a coffee \"given by an individual to mankind\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=XQwd5pwb_rUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=luciano+de+crescenzo+caff%C3%A8+sospeso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixwfLNzMXhAhVBmeAKHcYxDMgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=umanit%C3%A0&f=false|title=Il caff\u00e8 sospeso|last=Crescenzo|first=Luciano De|date=2010-10-07|publisher=Edizioni Mondadori|isbn=9788852014161|language=it}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Further|Dutch East India Company}}\n\nThe race among Europeans to obtain live coffee trees or beans was eventually won by the [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] in 1616.

He took them back to Amsterdam and found a home for them in the Botanical gardens, where they began to thrive. This apparently minor event received little publicity, but was to have a major impact on the history of coffee.\n\nThe beans that van der Broecke acquired from Mocha forty years earlier adjusted well to conditions in the greenhouses at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden and produced numerous healthy ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' bushes.

The proponents argue that Fair Trade helps the farmer receive a larger salary which allows them to live better lives.<ref>{{cite web|last1=transfairusa|title=Santiago's Story|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeiEw41o_gs|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}} Opponents argue that Fair Trade does not keep records and therefore cannot be accountable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Peter|title=Fairtrade is not fair|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzzXijnICKY|website=Youtube|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nA recent change to the coffee market are lattes, [[Frappuccino]]s and other sugary coffee drinks. With the rise of lattes and Frappuccinos becoming more popular this has caused coffee houses to be able to use cheaper coffee beans in their coffee, which has hurt the Latin American countries' economy. The cheaper coffee beans are called Robusta and they contain more caffeine than the more expensive beans. The cheaper beans' higher caffeine content is also a factor in their popularity. These cheaper beans hurt the Latin American economy because the producers receive less money for the production of the cheaper beans than they do for the production of the higher quality beans. Since the producers get paid less, they are receiving a smaller income, which in turn hurts the economy of Latin America.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scholer|first=Mortan|date=Fall 2017|title=Bitter or Better Future for Coffee Farmers|url=|journal=International Trade Forum|volume=|pages=9\u201312|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n\n===India===\n''Also see [[Coffee production in India]]''\n\n[[File:2015 0117 Monsooned Malabar beans unroosted.jpg|thumb|[[Monsooned Malabar]] arabica, compared with green Yirgachefe beans from [[Coffee production in Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]]]\nCoffee came to India well before the East India company, through an India [[Sufi]] saint named \"Baba Budan\".<ref name=\"baba\">{{cite book|last1=Wild|first1=Anthony|title=The East India Company Book of Coffee|date=10 April 1995|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0004127390}}</ref> The first record of coffee growing in [[India]] is following the introduction of coffee beans from Yemen by [[Baba Budan]] to the hills of [[Chikmagalur]], [[Karnataka]] in 1670.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickmagalur.nic.in/htmls/tour_bbgiri.htm|title=BABA BUDAN GIRI|website=chickmagalur.nic.in|access-date=27 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120215459/http://www.chickmagalur.nic.in/htmls/tour_bbgiri.htm|archive-date=20 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then coffee plantations have become established in the region, extending south to [[Kodagu]].<ref name=\"baba\"/>\n\n[[Coffee production in India]] is dominated in the hill tracts of [[South India]]n states, with the state of [[Karnataka]] accounting 53% followed by [[Kerala]] 28% and [[Tamil Nadu]] 11% of production of 8,200 [[tonne]]s.

Coffee is sold by the name of \"filter coffee\" by small restaurants and small chains like MTR's, Narasu's, etc. Recently, larger coffee outlet chains like Coffee Day and Starbucks have been opening up in larger cities and towns.\n\n==== Chikmagalur ====\nCoffee is the cornerstone of Chikmagalur's economy. Chikmagalur is the birthplace of coffee in India, where the seed was first sown about 350 years ago.\nCoffee Board is the department located in Chikmagalur town that oversees the production and marketing of coffee cultivated in the district. Coffee is cultivated in Chikmagalur district in an area of around 85,465 hectares with Arabica being the dominant variety grown in upper hills and Robusta being the major variety in the low level hills. There are around 15000 coffee growers in this district with 96% of them being small growers with holdings of less than or equal to 4 hectares. The average production is 55,000 MT: 35,000 MT of Arabica and 20,000 MT of Robusta. The average productivity per hectare is 810&nbsp;kg for Arabica and 1110&nbsp;kg of Robusta, which are higher than the national average. Arabica is a species of coffee that is also known as the \"coffee shrub of Arabia\", \"mountain coffee\" or \"arabica coffee\". Coffea arabica is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, being grown in southwest Arabia for well over 1,000 years. It is considered to produce better coffee than the other major commercially grown coffee species, Coffea canephora (robusta). Arabica contains less caffeine than any other commercially cultivated species of coffee.\n[[Robusta coffee|Robusta]] is a species of coffee which has its origins in western Africa. It is grown mostly in Africa and Brazil, where it is often called Conillon. It is also grown in Southeast Asia where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century. In recent years Vietnam, which only produces robusta, has surpassed Brazil, India, and Indonesia to become the world's single largest exporter. Approximately one third of the coffee produced in the world is robusta.\n\n===Japan===\nCoffee was introduced to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained a curiosity until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-cage.blogspot.com/2005/03/brief-history-of-coffee-in-japan.html|title=Brief history of Coffee in Japan |website=d-cage}}</ref> By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of freeze-dried instant coffee, canned coffee, and franchises such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Doutor Coffee]] in the late 20th century continued this trend, to the point that Japan is now one of the leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/foo_cof_con-food-coffee-consumption|title=Countries Compared by Lifestyle > Food and drink > Coffee > Consumption.

After several years coffee was planted on Indonesia Archipelago. Many coffee specialties are from the Indonesian Archipelago. The colloquial name for coffee, Java, comes from the time when most of Europe and America's coffee was grown in Java. Today Indonesia is one of the largest coffee producers in the world, mainly for export.\nHowever coffee is enjoyed in various ways around the archipelago like traditional \"Kopi Ende\" which is with ginger to fancy new ways.\n\n===Philippines===\nThe Philippines is one of the few countries that produces the four varieties of commercially viable coffee: Arabica, Liberica (Barako), Excelsa and Robusta. Climatic and soil conditions in the Philippines \u2013 from the lowland to mountain regions \u2013 make the country suitable for all four varieties.\n\nIn the Philippines, coffee has a history as rich as its flavor. The first coffee tree was introduced in [[Lipa, Batangas]] in 1740 by a Spanish Franciscan friar. From there, coffee growing spread to other parts of Batangas like Ibaan, Lemery, San Jose, Taal, and Tanauan. Batangas owed much of its wealth to the coffee plantations in these areas and Lipa eventually became the coffee capital of the Philippines.\n\nBy the 1860s, Batangas was exporting coffee to America through San Francisco. When the [[Suez Canal]] was opened, a new market started in Europe as well. Seeing the success of the Batange\u00f1os, Cavite followed suit by growing the first coffee seedlings in 1876 in Amadeo. In spite of this, Lipa still reigned as the center for coffee production in the Philippines and Batangas barako was commanding five times the price of other Asian coffee beans. In 1880, the Philippines was the fourth largest exporter of coffee beans, and when the [[coffee rust]] hit Brazil, Africa, and Java, it became the only source of coffee beans worldwide.\n\nThe glory days of the Philippine coffee industry lasted until 1889 when coffee rust hit the Philippine shores. That, coupled with an insect infestation, destroyed virtually all the coffee trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of coffee. A few of the surviving coffee seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was not the end of the Philippines' coffee growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Philippine government, with the help of the Americans, brought in a more resistant variety of coffee. It was also then that instant coffee was being produced commercially, thus increasing the demand for beans. Because of favorable market conditions, many farmers went back to growing coffee in the 1960s. But the sudden proliferation of coffee farms resulted in a surplus of beans around the world, and for a while importation of coffee was banned in order to protect local coffee producers. When Brazil was hit by a frost in the 1970s, world market coffee prices soared. The Philippines became a member of the [[International Coffee Organization]] (ICO) in 1980.\n\n===Vietnam===\nVietnam is one of the world's main coffee exporters (according to 2005 statistics). Arabica is the first imported coffee variety to Vietnam since 1857. The first is the trial planting in the northern provinces such as Ha Nam, Phu Ly, then expanding to provinces like Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh. Then spread to the central provinces. Finally, coffee grows in the Central Highlands and it is recognized that the Central Highlands is a good place to grow coffee.\n\nIn 1908, French imported two coffee varieties - Robusta and Liberica. After a while, the French colonialists found that coffee arabica was not effective so it brought Congo coffee into the Central Highlands.\nHere, coffee trees grow very strongly. And the Central Highlands became the largest coffee growing area in the country, famous in the world, especially coffee \"Buon Me Thuoc\".\n\nCoffee of [[Trung Nguyen]] is a No. 1 coffee brand in Vietnam and has exported to over 60 countries around the world. It was founded in 1996 [[Dang Le Nguyen Vu]].\n\n==Production==\n\nThe first step in Europeans' wresting the means of production was effected by [[Nicolaes Witsen]], the enterprising burgomaster of Amsterdam and member of the governing board of the [[Dutch East India Company]] who urged [[Joan van Hoorn]], the Dutch governor at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] that some coffee plants be obtained at the export port of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] in Yemen, the source of Europe's supply, and established in the Dutch East Indies;<ref>William Law, ''The History of Coffee, including a chapter on chicory'' (London) 1850:14, on the authority of [[Hermann Boerhaave]], director of the botanical garden at Leiden.</ref> the project of raising many plants from the seeds of the first shipment met with such success that the Dutch East India Company was able to supply Europe's demand with \"Java coffee\" by 1719.<ref>E. M. Jacobs, ''Merchant in Asia: the trade of the Dutch East India Company during the '' \"Coffee from Mocha and the highlands of Batavia\" :260ff describes the introduction of coffee plantations in detail</ref> Encouraged by their success, they soon had coffee plantations in [[Ceylon]], [[Sumatra]] and other Sunda islands.<ref>Henry Mills Alden, \"A Cup of coffee\", ''Harper's new monthly magazine'' '''44''' (1872:241).</ref> Coffee trees were soon grown under glass at the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus of Leiden]], whence slips were generously extended to other botanical gardens. Dutch representatives at the negotiations that led to the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] presented their French counterparts with a coffee plant, which was grown on at the ''Jardin du Roi'', predecessor of the [[Jardin des Plantes]], in Paris.\n\nThe introduction of coffee to the Americas was effected by [[Gabriel DeClieu|Captain Gabriel des Clieux]], who obtained cuttings from the reluctant botanist [[Antoine de Jussieu]], who was loath to disfigure the king's coffee tree.<ref>Toussaint-Samat 2008:530.</ref> Clieux, when water rations dwindled during a difficult voyage, shared his portion with his precious plants and protected them from a Dutchman, perhaps an agent of the Provinces jealous of the Batavian trade.<ref>The story appeared in J.J.C. Goube, ''Histoire du duch\u00e9 de Normandie'' (1815, vol. III:191), of which a translated excerpt was contributed to ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' (February 1840:136) \"Generosity of M. Desclieux \u2013 The Coffee-tree at Martinique\". The date of this event is variously reported: in Goube it is 1726.</ref> Clieux nurtured the plants on his arrival in the West Indies, and established them in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Saint-Domingue]] in addition to [[Martinique]], where a blight had struck the [[cacao plantation]]s, which were replaced by coffee plantations in a space of three years, is attributed to France through its colonization of many parts of the continent starting with the Martinique and the colonies of the West Indies where the first French coffee plantations were founded.\n\nThe first coffee plantation in Brazil occurred in 1727 when Lt. Col. Francisco de Melo Palheta smuggled seeds, still essentially from the germ plasm originally taken from Yemen to Batavia,<ref>\"Des Clieux's cutting was the ancestor of all the coffee trees of Martinique, the West Indies, Brazil and Colombia, and some of them went back across the Atlantic to become a source of income to the African colonies that have now gained their independence\" (Toussaint-Samat 2008:531).</ref> from [[French Guiana]]. By the 1800s, Brazil's harvests would turn coffee from an elite indulgence to a drink for the masses. Brazil, which like most other countries cultivates coffee as a commercial commodity, relied heavily on [[Slavery in Brazil|slave labor from Africa]] for the viability of the plantations until the [[Lei \u00c1urea|abolition of slavery in 1888]]. The success of coffee in 17th-century Europe was paralleled with the spread of the habit of [[tobacco smoking]] all over the continent during the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648).\n\nFor many decades in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil was the biggest producer of coffee and a virtual monopolist in the trade. However, a policy of maintaining high prices soon opened opportunities to other nations, such as [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Coffee in Colombia, 1850\u20131970: An Economic, Social and Political History |first= Marco |last=Palacios|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-52859-3}}</ref> [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Vietnam]], now second only to Brazil as the major coffee producer in the world.

The [[Kingdom of Kaffa]], home of the plant, was estimated to produce between 50,000 and 60,000 kilograms of coffee beans in the 1880s. Commercial production effectively began in 1907 with the founding of the inland port of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]]. 100,000 kilograms of coffee was exported from Gambela in 1908, while in 1927\u20138 over 4&nbsp;million kilograms passed through that port.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Economic History'', p. 202</ref> Coffee plantations were also developed in [[Arsi Province]] at the same time, and were eventually exported by means of the [[Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia|Addis Ababa \u2013 Djibouti Railway]].

On his return to that city in 1657, Thevenot gave some of the beans to his friends, one of whom was de la Croix.\n\nIn 1669, [[Soleiman Agha]], Ambassador from Sultan [[Mehmed IV]], arrived in Paris with his entourage bringing with him a large quantity of coffee beans. Not only did they provide their French and European guests with coffee to drink, but they also donated some beans to the royal court. Between July 1669 and May 1670, the Ambassador managed to firmly establish the custom of drinking coffee among Parisians.\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany, coffeehouses were first established in North Sea ports, including [[Bremen]] (1673) and [[Hamburg]] (1677). Initially, this new beverage was written in the English form ''coffee'', but during the 1700s the Germans gradually adopted the French word ''caf\u00e9'', then slowly changed the spelling to ''Kaffee'', which is the present word. In the 18th century the popularity of coffee gradually spread around the German lands, and was taken up by the ruling classes. Coffee was served at the court of the [[Great Elector]], Frederick William of Brandenburg, as early as 1675, but [[Berlin]]'s first public coffee house did not open until 1721.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.web-books.com/Classics/ON/B0/B701/13MB701.html|title=8.

[[Naples]], albeit being known today as the city of coffee, has seen it later, probably through the ships coming in the ports of [[Sicily]] and Naples itself. Some date the neapolitan discovery of coffee back to 1614, when the composer, explorer and musicologist [[Pietro Della Valle]] sent news from the [[Holy Land]], in his letters to the dear friend, physician, poet, Greek scholar and Mario Schipano and his gathering of intellectuals, of a drink (called [[Turkish coffee|kahve]])<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=SKBfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA352&dq=mario+schipano+kahve&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrxpqWktThAhVP6qQKHcJFAMQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=mario%20schipano%20kahve&f=false|title=Origini|last=Bausilio|first=Giovanni|date=2018-06-11|publisher=Key Editore|isbn=9788827901380|language=it}}</ref> the Arab Muslims brewed in hot pots. Some believe coffee arrived in Naples earlier, from [[Salerno]] and its [[Schola Medica Salernitana]], where the plant came to be used for its medicinal properties between the XIV and XV century. Celebrated by neapolitan art, literature, music and daily social life, coffee soon became a protagonist in Naples, where it was prepared with great care in the \"cuccumella\", the typical neapolitan filter coffee pot derived by the invention of the parisian Morize in 1819. Neapolitan artisans came in touch with it when brought, once again through the sea commercial routes, to the Port of Naples. An indication of the approach of neapolitans to coffee as a social drink, is the practice of the [[Caff\u00e8 sospeso|suspended coffee]] (the act of paying in advance for a coffee to be consumed by the next customer) invented there and defined by the neapolitan philosopher and writer [[Luciano De Crescenzo]] a coffee \"given by an individual to mankind\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=XQwd5pwb_rUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=luciano+de+crescenzo+caff%C3%A8+sospeso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixwfLNzMXhAhVBmeAKHcYxDMgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=umanit%C3%A0&f=false|title=Il caff\u00e8 sospeso|last=Crescenzo|first=Luciano De|date=2010-10-07|publisher=Edizioni Mondadori|isbn=9788852014161|language=it}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Further|Dutch East India Company}}\n\nThe race among Europeans to obtain live coffee trees or beans was eventually won by the [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] in 1616. [[Pieter van den Broecke]], a Dutch merchant, obtained some of the closely guarded coffee bushes from Mocha, Yemen, in 1616. He took them back to Amsterdam and found a home for them in the Botanical gardens, where they began to thrive. This apparently minor event received little publicity, but was to have a major impact on the history of coffee.\n\nThe beans that van der Broecke acquired from Mocha forty years earlier adjusted well to conditions in the greenhouses at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden and produced numerous healthy ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' bushes. In 1658 the Dutch first used them to begin coffee cultivation in [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka) and later in southern India. They abandoned this cultivation to focus on their Javanese plantations in order to avoid lowering the price by oversupply.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nWithin a few years, the Dutch colonies ([[Java]] in Asia, [[Suriname]] in the Americas) had become the main suppliers of coffee to Europe.\n\n===Poland===\n\nCoffee reached the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 17th century, primarily through merchants trading with the Ottomans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kawa w Polsce \u2013 historia i styl picia \u2013 Koneserzy.pl|url = http://www.koneserzy.pl/smaki-konesera/316-kawa-w-polsce-%25E2%2580%2593-historia-i-styl-picia.html|website = www.koneserzy.pl|accessdate = 30 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208070304/http://www.koneserzy.pl/smaki-konesera/316-kawa-w-polsce-%25E2%2580%2593-historia-i-styl-picia.html|archive-date = 8 December 2015|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The first coffee shops opened a century later.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Otwarcie kawiarni Duvala w Warszawie \u2013 Muzeum Historii Polski|url = http://muzhp.pl/pl/e/1668/otwarcie-kawiarni-duvala-w-warszawie|website = muzhp.pl|accessdate = 30 November 2015}}</ref> Usage of coffee has grown since, though it was a luxury commodity during the communist era of the [[Polish People's Republic]].

The cheaper coffee beans are called Robusta and they contain more caffeine than the more expensive beans. The cheaper beans' higher caffeine content is also a factor in their popularity. These cheaper beans hurt the Latin American economy because the producers receive less money for the production of the cheaper beans than they do for the production of the higher quality beans.

Coffee is sold by the name of \"filter coffee\" by small restaurants and small chains like MTR's, Narasu's, etc. Recently, larger coffee outlet chains like Coffee Day and Starbucks have been opening up in larger cities and towns.\n\n==== Chikmagalur ====\nCoffee is the cornerstone of Chikmagalur's economy. Chikmagalur is the birthplace of coffee in India, where the seed was first sown about 350 years ago.\nCoffee Board is the department located in Chikmagalur town that oversees the production and marketing of coffee cultivated in the district. Coffee is cultivated in Chikmagalur district in an area of around 85,465 hectares with Arabica being the dominant variety grown in upper hills and Robusta being the major variety in the low level hills. There are around 15000 coffee growers in this district with 96% of them being small growers with holdings of less than or equal to 4 hectares. The average production is 55,000 MT: 35,000 MT of Arabica and 20,000 MT of Robusta. The average productivity per hectare is 810&nbsp;kg for Arabica and 1110&nbsp;kg of Robusta, which are higher than the national average. Arabica is a species of coffee that is also known as the \"coffee shrub of Arabia\", \"mountain coffee\" or \"arabica coffee\". Coffea arabica is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, being grown in southwest Arabia for well over 1,000 years. It is considered to produce better coffee than the other major commercially grown coffee species, Coffea canephora (robusta). Arabica contains less caffeine than any other commercially cultivated species of coffee.\n[[Robusta coffee|Robusta]] is a species of coffee which has its origins in western Africa. It is grown mostly in Africa and Brazil, where it is often called Conillon. It is also grown in Southeast Asia where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century. In recent years Vietnam, which only produces robusta, has surpassed Brazil, India, and Indonesia to become the world's single largest exporter. Approximately one third of the coffee produced in the world is robusta.\n\n===Japan===\nCoffee was introduced to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained a curiosity until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-cage.blogspot.com/2005/03/brief-history-of-coffee-in-japan.html|title=Brief history of Coffee in Japan |website=d-cage}}</ref> By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of freeze-dried instant coffee, canned coffee, and franchises such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Doutor Coffee]] in the late 20th century continued this trend, to the point that Japan is now one of the leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/foo_cof_con-food-coffee-consumption|title=Countries Compared by Lifestyle > Food and drink > Coffee > Consumption.

After several years coffee was planted on Indonesia Archipelago. Many coffee specialties are from the Indonesian Archipelago. The colloquial name for coffee, Java, comes from the time when most of Europe and America's coffee was grown in Java. Today Indonesia is one of the largest coffee producers in the world, mainly for export.\nHowever coffee is enjoyed in various ways around the archipelago like traditional \"Kopi Ende\" which is with ginger to fancy new ways.\n\n===Philippines===\nThe Philippines is one of the few countries that produces the four varieties of commercially viable coffee: Arabica, Liberica (Barako), Excelsa and Robusta. Climatic and soil conditions in the Philippines \u2013 from the lowland to mountain regions \u2013 make the country suitable for all four varieties.\n\nIn the Philippines, coffee has a history as rich as its flavor. The first coffee tree was introduced in [[Lipa, Batangas]] in 1740 by a Spanish Franciscan friar. From there, coffee growing spread to other parts of Batangas like Ibaan, Lemery, San Jose, Taal, and Tanauan. Batangas owed much of its wealth to the coffee plantations in these areas and Lipa eventually became the coffee capital of the Philippines.\n\nBy the 1860s, Batangas was exporting coffee to America through San Francisco. When the [[Suez Canal]] was opened, a new market started in Europe as well. Seeing the success of the Batange\u00f1os, Cavite followed suit by growing the first coffee seedlings in 1876 in Amadeo. In spite of this, Lipa still reigned as the center for coffee production in the Philippines and Batangas barako was commanding five times the price of other Asian coffee beans. In 1880, the Philippines was the fourth largest exporter of coffee beans, and when the [[coffee rust]] hit Brazil, Africa, and Java, it became the only source of coffee beans worldwide.\n\nThe glory days of the Philippine coffee industry lasted until 1889 when coffee rust hit the Philippine shores. That, coupled with an insect infestation, destroyed virtually all the coffee trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of coffee. A few of the surviving coffee seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was not the end of the Philippines' coffee growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Philippine government, with the help of the Americans, brought in a more resistant variety of coffee. It was also then that instant coffee was being produced commercially, thus increasing the demand for beans. Because of favorable market conditions, many farmers went back to growing coffee in the 1960s. But the sudden proliferation of coffee farms resulted in a surplus of beans around the world, and for a while importation of coffee was banned in order to protect local coffee producers. When Brazil was hit by a frost in the 1970s, world market coffee prices soared. The Philippines became a member of the [[International Coffee Organization]] (ICO) in 1980.\n\n===Vietnam===\nVietnam is one of the world's main coffee exporters (according to 2005 statistics). Arabica is the first imported coffee variety to Vietnam since 1857. The first is the trial planting in the northern provinces such as Ha Nam, Phu Ly, then expanding to provinces like Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh. Then spread to the central provinces. Finally, coffee grows in the Central Highlands and it is recognized that the Central Highlands is a good place to grow coffee.\n\nIn 1908, French imported two coffee varieties - Robusta and Liberica. After a while, the French colonialists found that coffee arabica was not effective so it brought Congo coffee into the Central Highlands.\nHere, coffee trees grow very strongly. And the Central Highlands became the largest coffee growing area in the country, famous in the world, especially coffee \"Buon Me Thuoc\".\n\nCoffee of [[Trung Nguyen]] is a No. 1 coffee brand in Vietnam and has exported to over 60 countries around the world. It was founded in 1996 [[Dang Le Nguyen Vu]].\n\n==Production==\n\nThe first step in Europeans' wresting the means of production was effected by [[Nicolaes Witsen]], the enterprising burgomaster of Amsterdam and member of the governing board of the [[Dutch East India Company]] who urged [[Joan van Hoorn]], the Dutch governor at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] that some coffee plants be obtained at the export port of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] in Yemen, the source of Europe's supply, and established in the Dutch East Indies;<ref>William Law, ''The History of Coffee, including a chapter on chicory'' (London) 1850:14, on the authority of [[Hermann Boerhaave]], director of the botanical garden at Leiden.</ref> the project of raising many plants from the seeds of the first shipment met with such success that the Dutch East India Company was able to supply Europe's demand with \"Java coffee\" by 1719.<ref>E. M. Jacobs, ''Merchant in Asia: the trade of the Dutch East India Company during the '' \"Coffee from Mocha and the highlands of Batavia\" :260ff describes the introduction of coffee plantations in detail</ref> Encouraged by their success, they soon had coffee plantations in [[Ceylon]], [[Sumatra]] and other Sunda islands.<ref>Henry Mills Alden, \"A Cup of coffee\", ''Harper's new monthly magazine'' '''44''' (1872:241).</ref> Coffee trees were soon grown under glass at the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus of Leiden]], whence slips were generously extended to other botanical gardens. Dutch representatives at the negotiations that led to the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] presented their French counterparts with a coffee plant, which was grown on at the ''Jardin du Roi'', predecessor of the [[Jardin des Plantes]], in Paris.\n\nThe introduction of coffee to the Americas was effected by [[Gabriel DeClieu|Captain Gabriel des Clieux]], who obtained cuttings from the reluctant botanist [[Antoine de Jussieu]], who was loath to disfigure the king's coffee tree.<ref>Toussaint-Samat 2008:530.</ref> Clieux, when water rations dwindled during a difficult voyage, shared his portion with his precious plants and protected them from a Dutchman, perhaps an agent of the Provinces jealous of the Batavian trade.<ref>The story appeared in J.J.C. Goube, ''Histoire du duch\u00e9 de Normandie'' (1815, vol. III:191), of which a translated excerpt was contributed to ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' (February 1840:136) \"Generosity of M. Desclieux \u2013 The Coffee-tree at Martinique\". The date of this event is variously reported: in Goube it is 1726.</ref> Clieux nurtured the plants on his arrival in the West Indies, and established them in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Saint-Domingue]] in addition to [[Martinique]], where a blight had struck the [[cacao plantation]]s, which were replaced by coffee plantations in a space of three years, is attributed to France through its colonization of many parts of the continent starting with the Martinique and the colonies of the West Indies where the first French coffee plantations were founded.\n\nThe first coffee plantation in Brazil occurred in 1727 when Lt. Col. Francisco de Melo Palheta smuggled seeds, still essentially from the germ plasm originally taken from Yemen to Batavia,<ref>\"Des Clieux's cutting was the ancestor of all the coffee trees of Martinique, the West Indies, Brazil and Colombia, and some of them went back across the Atlantic to become a source of income to the African colonies that have now gained their independence\" (Toussaint-Samat 2008:531).</ref> from [[French Guiana]]. By the 1800s, Brazil's harvests would turn coffee from an elite indulgence to a drink for the masses. Brazil, which like most other countries cultivates coffee as a commercial commodity, relied heavily on [[Slavery in Brazil|slave labor from Africa]] for the viability of the plantations until the [[Lei \u00c1urea|abolition of slavery in 1888]]. The success of coffee in 17th-century Europe was paralleled with the spread of the habit of [[tobacco smoking]] all over the continent during the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648).\n\nFor many decades in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil was the biggest producer of coffee and a virtual monopolist in the trade. However, a policy of maintaining high prices soon opened opportunities to other nations, such as [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Coffee in Colombia, 1850\u20131970: An Economic, Social and Political History |first= Marco |last=Palacios|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-52859-3}}</ref> [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Vietnam]], now second only to Brazil as the major coffee producer in the world.

The [[Kingdom of Kaffa]], home of the plant, was estimated to produce between 50,000 and 60,000 kilograms of coffee beans in the 1880s. Commercial production effectively began in 1907 with the founding of the inland port of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]]. 100,000 kilograms of coffee was exported from Gambela in 1908, while in 1927\u20138 over 4&nbsp;million kilograms passed through that port.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Economic History'', p. 202</ref> Coffee plantations were also developed in [[Arsi Province]] at the same time, and were eventually exported by means of the [[Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia|Addis Ababa \u2013 Djibouti Railway]].
