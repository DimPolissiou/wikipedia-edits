They have released 10 studio albums, 6 live albums and 3 rarities collections as well as a couple of offshoot project albums in the guise of the Galahad Acoustic Quintet and the Galahad Electric Company. Over the last 32 years they have played with the likes of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]], [[IQ (band)|IQ]] and [[Twelfth Night (band)|Twelfth Night]]. Galahad have performed their own shows and at festivals in Europe and North America, and have sold tens of thousands of albums despite never having had a major record deal. All releases are on their own 'Avalon Records' imprint other than some re-issues which are released in association with Polish label 'Oskar Productions'. \nIn 2012 and after 27 years of existence Galahad released their first ever LP 'Battle Scars' in conjunction with Ritual Echo Records, on high quality 180 gram vinyl, in a gatefold sleeve, as a limited edition pressing of 300 which is already fast becoming a  collectors item.<ref>{{Citation | year =2011 | title =One For The Record, The Official Biography of Galahad | publisher = Ministry of Prog}}</ref>\n\nThe band's vocalist Stuart Nicholson described Galahad's early days thus: \"...the band was formed just after the so called second wave of \u2018Prog\u2019 bands such as Marillion, Pallas, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon etc. of Prog bands came to the fore in the early Eighties. They all started around 1978 \u2013 1981 and we started in 1985 after the bubble had effectively burst, but didn\u2019t really get going seriously until 1990 onwards. To be honest we really did play just for fun in the early days and weren\u2019t really that concerned about record deals etc. It was only after playing with some of the bigger bands when we thought. Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\" <ref name=\"Stu-interview\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/galahad Interview with Stu Nicholson], by Grande Rock.</ref>\n\nFounder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017.

[[England|English]] [[progressive rock]] band formed in 1985. They have released 10 studio albums, 6 live albums and 3 rarities collections as well as a couple of offshoot project albums in the guise of the Galahad Acoustic Quintet and the Galahad Electric Company. Over the last 32 years they have played with the likes of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]], [[IQ (band)|IQ]] and [[Twelfth Night (band)|Twelfth Night]]. Galahad have performed their own shows and at festivals in Europe and North America, and have sold tens of thousands of albums despite never having had a major record deal. All releases are on their own 'Avalon Records' imprint other than some re-issues which are released in association with Polish label 'Oskar Productions'. \nIn 2012 and after 27 years of existence Galahad released their first ever LP 'Battle Scars' in conjunction with Ritual Echo Records, on high quality 180 gram vinyl, in a gatefold sleeve, as a limited edition pressing of 300 which is already fast becoming a  collectors item.<ref>{{Citation | year =2011 | title =One For The Record, The Official Biography of Galahad | publisher = Ministry of Prog}}</ref>\n\nThe band's vocalist Stuart Nicholson described Galahad's early days thus: \"...the band was formed just after the so called second wave of \u2018Prog\u2019 bands such as Marillion, Pallas, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon etc. of Prog bands came to the fore in the early Eighties. They all started around 1978 \u2013 1981 and we started in 1985 after the bubble had effectively burst, but didn\u2019t really get going seriously until 1990 onwards. To be honest we really did play just for fun in the early days and weren\u2019t really that concerned about record deals etc. It was only after playing with some of the bigger bands when we thought. Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\" <ref name=\"Stu-interview\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/galahad Interview with Stu Nicholson], by Grande Rock.</ref>\n\nFounder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017. Producer [[Karl Groom]] filled in for Keyworth on the band's ''Quiet Storms'' album released in May 2017,<ref>https://www.galahadonline.com/news/blog/31-03-2017-an-official-statement-from-the-band</ref> but will not join the band full time.\n\nLee Abraham was officially announced as the new Galahad

This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who played a police officer closely following the lead pair.\n\nBachchan was next seen in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s political drama ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'', which was a moderate success at the box office. His performance as the morally upright son of a troubled politician (played by his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]]) earned him rave reviews from critics as well as his second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. His next two releases ''[[Dus]]'' (2005) and ''[[Bluffmaster!]]'' (2005) were both moderately successful, but did not earn much critical appreciation.\n\nBachchan won his third consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in [[Karan Johar]]'s critically acclaimed romantic drama ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), which emerged as a moderate commercial success despite the fact that it dealt with the controversial subject of marital infidelity. Bachchan played the role of a man whose wife ([[Rani Mukerji]]) is unhappy with their marriage, and so begins an affair with a friend ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) who is also unhappy with his marriage to his wife ([[Preity Zinta]]).\n\nBachchan then starred opposite [[Aishwarya Rai]] in the period romance ''[[Umrao Jaan (2006 film)|Umrao Jaan]]'', a remake of the [[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|1981 film of the same name]] starring [[Rekha]] and [[Farooq Sheikh]] in the lead roles. The film failed to earn the same level of appreciation as the original, and was also a commercial failure. He was next seen in ''[[Dhoom 2]]'' (2006), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the original ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004) joined by new cast members [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Aishwarya Rai]], and [[Bipasha Basu]]. The film emerged as the highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 2006|Bollywood film of 2006]], but some critics commented that Bachchan was \"reduced to a mere supporting player\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Masand |first=Rajeev |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-go-dhoom-2/26974-8-1.html |website=IBN Live |title=Masand's Verdict: Go ''Dhoom 2'' |date=26 November 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115503/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-go-dhoom-2/26974-8-1.html |archivedate=27 November 2012  }}</ref> to his co-star Roshan.\n\nBachchan earned much critical acclaim for his performance in Mani Ratnam's ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'' (2007), loosely based on the life of business magnate [[Dhirubhai Ambani]].\"<ref name=\"rediff2007\">{{cite web|last=Sen|first=Raja|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/12guru.htm|website=Rediff India Abroad|title=Watch ''Guru'' for the actors|date=12 January 2007}}</ref> The film starred him alongside [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] (their first professional collaboration after marriage), [[R.

The film was declared average by Box Office India and was a moderate success overseas. He was then seen playing a minor role in the female-centric drama ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]'' (2007) as the love interest of the film's lead actress [[Rani Mukerji]].\n\nBachchan's first release of 2008 was [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s ''[[Sarkar Raj]]'', which featured him and his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]] reprising their roles from ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005) while his wife [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] entered the cast as a new addition. This film proved to be successful at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. His next release was the [[fantasy]] [[adventure film]] ''[[Drona (2008 film)|Drona]]'' (2008), which was a major failure both critically and commercially.\n\nBachchan was next seen in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]'' (2008), a romantic comedy about two men (Bachchan and [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) who pretend to be gay in order to be allowed to live with a girl ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), but then find that they have both fallen in love with her. The film was a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]].\n\nBachchan's first release of 2009 was ''[[Delhi-6]]'', which received a lukewarm response from critics. Later that year he was seen in the family dramedy ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', which he also produced. The film's plot centered on a boy ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) who suffers from [[progeria]] whose parents were played by Abhishek Bachchan and [[Vidya Balan]]. For his work as a producer on the film, Bachchan earned the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi]].\n\n=== 2010\u2013present ===\n[[File:Abhi 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Bachchan at a promotional event for ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' in 2013]]\nBachchan experienced a brief setback in his career<ref>{{cite web|last=Havewala|first=Aspi|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/line-of-sight/the-half-ticket-career-of-abhishek-bachchan/|website=Times of India|title=The half ticket career of Abhishek Bachchan|date=14 May 2011|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> with four films that failed critically and commercially.
