However, it was a critical battle for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and not involved in the formation of the future state of West Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>. \n\n==Background==\nIn December, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward Johnson]] occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly 4,400 feet above sea level)  to defend the  [[Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike]] that offered a point of access from the mountains of western Virginia into the strategic Shenandoah Valley.

The next morning, Milroy divided his troops into a two pronged attack to flank the Confederate camp. The first column advanced up the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike, engaging the Confederate right side for several hours before withdrawing. Beause of the difficult mountain terrain, the second Union column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column, unable to suuport the main body of Union troops on the right<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>, but then attacked the Confederate left<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. \n\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting raged for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy's strong force was in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to dislodge. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" The fighting moved back and forth from advance to retreat, with the Union temporarily occupying the post, only to be driven off. The Confederates attempted their own flanking maneuvers which quickly failed because their force was too thin. The fighting was in such close quarters that eight of the Confederate cannons in the fortification could not be used<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>.  After fighting for over seven hours<ref>https://emergingcivilwar.com/2012/11/24/a-historians-stroll-across-camp-allegheny/</ref> Milroy's troops finally withdrew, retreating to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the Civil War, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. \n\nIronically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to leave Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref><ref>http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle-summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html</ref>. The snow was often knee to waist deep. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. In March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent [[Battle of McDowell]] in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson, by then promoted to General, had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable<ref>http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf</ref>. After the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that Shenandoah Mountain to the southeast was a more defensible position. Combined with the loss of men in the bitter mountain weather and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, [[General Robert E. Lee]] agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia were small by later standards but left and enduring footprint because those counties that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny (and the subsequent Battle of McDowell,) the future state line between Virginia and West Virginia began and stopped at the Pocohantas and Highland County line, even though the counties shared the same geographic traits and mountain culture.  Pocohantas County remained in Union Control, Highland County in Confederate hands. As a result, Highland County did not participate in the councils and voting for secession to West Virginia, but continued to be part of the state of Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>.\n\nIn 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \"A Bivouac of the Dead<ref>http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/</ref>,\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment.

As a result, Highland County did not participate in the councils and voting for secession to West Virginia, but continued to be part of the state of Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>.\n\nIn 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \"A Bivouac of the Dead<ref>http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/</ref>,\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment.

In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}. It is believed that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians claimed that [[Land of Punt|Punt]], known as gold country, was in Ethiopia in 980{{nbsp}}BC.

Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]].

This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]].

Ethiopia repudiated the treaty in 1893. Insulted, Italy declared war on Ethiopia in 1895. The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] resulted in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipped and supported by Russia and France.

The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], though not much was done to end the hostility.\n\nDuring the conflict, both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes.

Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.\n\n===Fall of monarchy===\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]\nIn 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the \"[[Derg]]\", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]].

In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}. It is believed that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians claimed that [[Land of Punt|Punt]], known as gold country, was in Ethiopia in 980{{nbsp}}BC.

Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]].

This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]].

Ethiopia repudiated the treaty in 1893. Insulted, Italy declared war on Ethiopia in 1895. The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] resulted in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipment and support by Russia and France.

The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], though not much was done to end the hostility.\n\nDuring the conflict, both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes.

Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.\n\n===Fall of monarchy===\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]\nIn 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the \"[[Derg]]\", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]].

By 1616 he was a student of [[geometry]] at the [[University of Pisa]]. There he came under the tutelege of [[Benedetto Castelli]], who probably introduced him to [[Galileo Galilei]]. In 1617 he briefly joined the [[House of Medici|Medici]] court in [[Florence]], under the patronage of [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]], but the following year he returned to Pisa and began teaching Mathematics in place of Castelli. He applied for the Chair of Mathematics at the [[University of Bologna]], but was turned down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1620, he returned to the Jesuate house in Milan, where he had lived as a noviate, and became a deacon under Cardinal Borromeo. He studied [[theology]] in the [[monastery]] of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict's monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]], but was declined each time, despite taking six months' leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life.<ref name=\":2\">J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri, ''MacTutor History of Mathematics'', (University of St Andrews, Scotland, July 2014) </ref> He was also turned down from a position at the [[University of Parma]], which be believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administrated by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo's support of him to the Bolognese senate.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nHe published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his ''Geometria Indivisibilius'', where he outlined what would later become the [[Method of indivisibles|Method of Indivisibles]], was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1947, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy.\n\nGalileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo.  Galileo said of him, \"few, if any, since [[Archimedes]], have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Vincenzo Viviani]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also benefited from the patronage of [[Cesare Marsili]].<ref name=\":3\">[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/cavaleri.html Cavalieri, Bonaventura], at The Galileo Project</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by [[Stefano degli Angeli|Stephano degli Angeli]], a fellow Jesuat and student of Cavalieri.

In this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into [[parabola]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[ellipse]]s, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical, since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Stargazer, the Life and Times of the Telescope, by Fred Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&pg=PA134&dq=gregory+cassegrain+mersenne p. 135]</ref>\n[[File:Cavalieri's Speccio Ustorio figures 7 and 8.jpg|thumb|Geometrical figures from ''Lo Speccio Ustorio'', used in proofs of properties of parabolic reflecting surfaces.]]\nHe also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCavalieri's work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a [[reflecting telescope]], initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes' Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ariotti|first=Piero E.|date=September 1975|title=Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and the Reflecting Telescope|journal=Isis|volume=66|issue=3|pages=303\u2013321|doi=10.1086/351471|issn=0021-1753}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=March 1991|title=Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=22|issue=2|pages=118\u2013124|doi=10.2307/2686447|issn=0746-8342|jstor=2686447}}</ref> He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror.

His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Work in Geometry and the Method of Indivisibles ====\n[[File:Cavalieri - Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota, 1653 - 1250292.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece of the ''Geometria Indivisilibus.'']]\nInspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the [[method of indivisibles]] to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'', or ''Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua''. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as 'all the lines' or 'all the planes' of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri's method, and are also fundamental features of [[integral calculus]].  He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written <math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^2dx = 1/3</math>, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an [[Archimedean spiral|Archimedean Spiral]], which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cylinder is one third of the volume of a circumscribed cylinder.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics|title=Mathematics - The calculus|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn immediate application of the method of indivisibles is [[Cavalieri's principle]], which states that the [[volume]]s of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by [[Zu Gengzhi]] (480&ndash;525) of [[China]], in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 143\">Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 143.) and was first documented in his book 'Zhui Su'(\u300a[[:zh:\u7f00\u672f|\u7f00\u672f]]\u300b). This principle was also worked out by [[Shen Kuo]] in the 11th century.</ref>) \n\nThe method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful, but was limited in its usefulness in three respects. First, while Cavalieri's proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque; third, the treatment of the continuum as being composed of [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] was at the time condemned in Italy by the Jesuit order as a feature of [[atomism]], a forbidden doctrine. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, often with little regard for the limitations that Cavalieri imposed on the use of infinitesimals in order to avoid controversy, the ''Geometria indivisibilius''' critical reception was severe. [[Andr\u00e9 Tacquet|Andre Taquet]] and [[Paul Guldin]] both published responses to the ''Geometria indivisibilus.'' Guldin's critique, which was particularly in-depth, suggested that Cavalieri's method was derived from the work of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Bartholomew Sover]], attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nCavalieri's ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'', or ''Six Geometric Exercises (1647)'' was written in direct response to Guldin's criticism. It was initially drafted as a [[dialogue]] in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the ''Exercitationes'' dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin's arguments. He argued, disingenously, that his work regarded 'all the lines' as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ''Exercitationes'' nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles. By applying transformations to his variables, he generalised his previous integral result, showing that<math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^n dx = 1/(n+1)</math> for n=3 to n=9, which is now known as [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula|Cavalieri's quadrature formula.]]<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n==== Work in Astronomy ====\nTowards the end of his life, Cavalieri published two books on [[astronomy]]. While they use the language of [[astronomy]], he states in the text that he did not believe in or practice astronomy. Those books were the ''Nuova pratica astromlogica (1639)'' and the ''Trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua'' ''(1646).''\n\n==== Other Work ====\nHe published tables of [[logarithm]]s, emphasizing their practical use in the fields of astronomy and [[geography]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCavalieri also constructed a hydraulic pump for a monastery he was in management of.

He studied [[theology]] in the [[monastery]] of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict's monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]], but was declined each time, despite taking six months' leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life.<ref name=\":2\">J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri, ''MacTutor History of Mathematics'', (University of St Andrews, Scotland, July 2014) </ref> He was also turned down from a position at the [[University of Parma]], which be believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administrated by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo's support of him to the Bolognese senate.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nHe published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his ''Geometria Indivisibilius'', where he outlined what would later become the [[Method of indivisibles|Method of Indivisibles]], was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1947, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy.\n\nGalileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo.  Galileo said of him, \"few, if any, since [[Archimedes]], have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Vincenzo Viviani]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also benefited from the patronage of [[Cesare Marsili]].<ref name=\":3\">[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/cavaleri.html Cavalieri, Bonaventura], at The Galileo Project</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by [[Stefano degli Angeli|Stephano degli Angeli]], a fellow Jesuat and student of Cavalieri. Angeli would go on to further develop Cavalieri's method. \n\nIn 1647 he died, probably of gout.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Work ==\nFrom 1632 to 1646, Cavalieri published eleven books dealing with problems in astronomy, optics, motion and geometry.\n\n==== Work in Optics ====\nCavalieri's first book, first published in 1632 and reprinted once in 1650, was ''Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche'', or ''The [[Burning glass|Burning Mirror]], or a Treatise on Conic Sections''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZX64AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=%22lo+specchio+ustorio%22&ots=CzX83kjdXO&sig=bZmh3XzXN2mWZdIa32OGlyypwEk Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche]</ref>  The aim of ''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' was to address the question of how [[Archimedes]] could have used mirrors to burn the Roman fleet as they approached [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], a question still in debate.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_ArchimedesResult.html|title=2.009 Product Engineering Processes: Archimedes|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The book went beyond this purpose and also explored conic sections, reflections of light, and the properties of parabolas. In this book he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into [[parabola]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[ellipse]]s, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical, since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Stargazer, the Life and Times of the Telescope, by Fred Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&pg=PA134&dq=gregory+cassegrain+mersenne p. 135]</ref>\n[[File:Cavalieri's Speccio Ustorio figures 7 and 8.jpg|thumb|Geometrical figures from ''Lo Speccio Ustorio'', used in proofs of properties of parabolic reflecting surfaces.]]\nHe also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Lo Specchio Ustorio'' also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCavalieri's work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a [[reflecting telescope]], initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes' Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ariotti|first=Piero E.|date=September 1975|title=Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and the Reflecting Telescope|journal=Isis|volume=66|issue=3|pages=303\u2013321|doi=10.1086/351471|issn=0021-1753}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eves|first=Howard|date=March 1991|title=Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=22|issue=2|pages=118\u2013124|doi=10.2307/2686447|issn=0746-8342|jstor=2686447}}</ref> He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror. Cavalieri's second concept consisted of a main, truncated, paraboloid mirror and a second, convex mirror. His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Work in Geometry and the Method of Indivisibles ====\n[[File:Cavalieri - Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota, 1653 - 1250292.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece of the ''Geometria Indivisilibus.'']]\nInspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the [[method of indivisibles]] to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'', or ''Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua''. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as 'all the lines' or 'all the planes' of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri's method, and are also fundamental features of [[integral calculus]].  He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written <math>\\int\\limits_{0}^{1} x^2dx = 1/3</math>, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an [[Archimedean spiral|Archimedean Spiral]], which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cylinder is one third of the volume of a circumscribed cylinder.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics|title=Mathematics - The calculus|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn immediate application of the method of indivisibles is [[Cavalieri's principle]], which states that the [[volume]]s of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by [[Zu Gengzhi]] (480&ndash;525) of [[China]], in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.<ref name=\"needham volume 3 143\">Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 143.) and was first documented in his book 'Zhui Su'(\u300a[[:zh:\u7f00\u672f|\u7f00\u672f]]\u300b). This principle was also worked out by [[Shen Kuo]] in the 11th century.</ref>) \n\nThe method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful, but was limited in its usefulness in three respects. First, while Cavalieri's proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque; third, the treatment of the continuum as being composed of [[Infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] was at the time condemned in Italy by the Jesuit order as a feature of [[atomism]], a forbidden doctrine. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, often with little regard for the limitations that Cavalieri imposed on the use of infinitesimals in order to avoid controversy, the ''Geometria indivisibilius''' critical reception was severe. [[Andr\u00e9 Tacquet|Andre Taquet]] and [[Paul Guldin]] both published responses to the ''Geometria indivisibilus.'' Guldin's critique, which was particularly in-depth, suggested that Cavalieri's method was derived from the work of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Bartholomew Sover]], attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nCavalieri's ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'', or ''Six Geometric Exercises (1647)'' was written in direct response to Guldin's criticism. It was initially drafted as a [[dialogue]] in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the ''Exercitationes'' dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin's arguments. He argued, disingenously, that his work regarded 'all the lines' as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ''Exercitationes'' nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles. By applying transformations to his variables, he generalised his previous integral result, showing that<math>\\int_{0}^{1} x^n dx = 1/(n+1)</math> for n=3 to n=9, which is now known as [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula|Cavalieri's quadrature formula.]]<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n==== Work in Astronomy ====\nTowards the end of his life, Cavalieri published two books on [[astronomy]]. While they use the language of [[astronomy]], he states in the text that he did not believe in or practice astronomy. Those books were the ''Nuova pratica astromlogica (1639)'' and the ''Trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua'' ''(1646).''\n\n==== Other Work ====\nHe published tables of [[logarithm]]s, emphasizing their practical use in the fields of astronomy and [[geography]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCavalieri also constructed a hydraulic pump for a monastery he was in management of. The Duke of Mantua obtained one similar.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:IMG 4064 - Milano, Palazzo di Brera - Cavalieri, Bonaventura - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 19-jan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Cavalieri by Giovanni Antonio Labus, [[Palazzo di Brera]], [[Milan]], 1844]]\nAccording to [[Gilles-Gaston Granger]], Cavalieri belongs with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[John Wallis|Wallis]] and [[Colin Maclaurin|MacLaurin]] as one of those who in the 17th and 18th centuries \"redefine[d] the mathematical object\".<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [[Gilles-Gaston Granger]], ''Formes, op\u00e9rations, objets'', Vrin, 1994, p. 365 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuIjwu5avPcC&pg=PA365&lpg=PA365#v=onepage&f=false Online quotation]</ref>\n\nThe [[lunar crater]] [[Cavalerius (crater)|Cavalerius]] is named for Cavalieri.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Evangelista Torricelli]]\n*[[Stefano degli Angeli]]\n*[[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/cavaleri.html The Galileo Project: Cavalieri]\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://archive.org/details/elogiodelgalile01frisgoog Elogj di Galileo Galilei e di Bonaventura Cavalieri] by Giuseppe Galeazzi, Milan, 1778\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=I-eaNAAACAAJ&dq=%22Bonaventura+Cavalieri%22&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=eJMzT-XkHcT50gHK9P3WAg&redir_esc=y Bonaventura Cavalieri] by Antonio Favaro, vol. 31 of ''Amici e corrispondenti di Galileo Galilei'', C.

Established in response to the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, they underpinned the Air Force's geographically based command-and-control system for the duration of the conflict and into the early years of the [[Cold War]], until being superseded by a functional control system made up of [[RAAF Home Command|Home]], [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Commands]].\n\nThe area commands and their responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands to begin with in 1940\u201341: [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]], [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area]], [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]], and [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]]. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two [[Group (military aviation unit)|groups]] that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central Area was disbanded and most of its units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed [[No. 2 Training Group RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 (Training) Group]]. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]]; Northern Area was split into [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area]] and [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]], and a new command, [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area]], was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]], was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.\n\nBy the early 1950s, most operational units were based within Eastern Area Command, most  Air Force training was controlled by Southern Area Command, and maintenance was the responsibility of [[Maintenance Group RAAF|Maintenance Group]]. The area command structure was no longer considered appropriate for delivering the concentration of force necessary for combat, and the Federal government decided to replace it with a functional command-and-control system. In 1953, Eastern Area Command was re-formed as Home Command (controlling operations), Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command, and Maintenance Group was re-designated Maintenance Command. The three remaining area commands ceded their authority to the functional commands in 1954, and were disbanded by the end of 1956.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin and purpose===\n[[File:Caf goble.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Air Vice-Marshal Goble, who proposed a functional command system for the RAAF in 1940|alt=Portrait of man in dark military uniform with pilot's wings on chest, wearing peaked cap with two rows of braid]]\nOn the eve of World War&nbsp;II, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) comprised twelve flying [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]], two aircraft depots and a flying school, situated at five air bases: [[RAAF Point Cook|Point Cook]] and [[RAAF Laverton|Laverton]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]; [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]] and [[RAAF Base Rathmines|Rathmines]] in [[New South Wales]]; and [[RAAF Base Pearce|Pearce]] in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Stephens pp. 111\u2013112\">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref name=\"Gillison pp. 66\u201367\">\nGillison, [https://oldsite.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 66\u201367] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808194000/https://oldsite.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf |date=8 August 2017 }}\n</ref> An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wings]], [[Group (military aviation unit)|groups]], or [[Command (military formation)|commands]], as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]].

Established in response to the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, they underpinned the Air Force's geographically based command-and-control system for the duration of the conflict and into the early years of the [[Cold War]], until being superseded by a functional control system made up of [[RAAF Home Command|Home]], [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Commands]].\n\nThe area commands and their responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands to begin with in 1940\u201341: [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]], [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area]], [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]], and [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area]]. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two [[Group (military aviation unit)|groups]] that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central Area was disbanded and most of its units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed [[No. 2 Training Group RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 (Training) Group]]. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]]; Northern Area was split into [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area]] and [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]], and a new command, [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area]], was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, [[Northern Command (RAAF)|Northern Command]], was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.\n\nBy the early 1950s, most operational units were based within Eastern Area Command, most  Air Force training was controlled by Southern Area Command, and maintenance was the responsibility of [[Maintenance Group RAAF|Maintenance Group]]. The area command structure was no longer considered appropriate for delivering the concentration of force necessary for combat, and the Federal government decided to replace it with a functional command-and-control system. In 1953, Eastern Area Command was re-formed as Home Command (controlling operations), Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command, and Maintenance Group was re-designated Maintenance Command. The three remaining area commands ceded their authority to the functional commands in 1954, and were disbanded by the end of 1956.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin and purpose===\n[[File:Caf goble.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Air Vice-Marshal Goble, who proposed a functional command system for the RAAF in 1940|alt=Portrait of man in dark military uniform with pilot's wings on chest, wearing peaked cap with two rows of braid]]\nOn the eve of World War&nbsp;II, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) comprised twelve flying [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]], two aircraft depots and a flying school, situated at five air bases: [[RAAF Point Cook|Point Cook]] and [[RAAF Laverton|Laverton]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]; [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]] and [[RAAF Base Rathmines|Rathmines]] in [[New South Wales]]; and [[RAAF Base Pearce|Pearce]] in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Stephens pp. 111\u2013112\">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref name=\"Gillison pp. 66\u201367\">\nGillison, [https://oldsite.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 66\u201367] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808194000/https://oldsite.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf |date=8 August 2017 }}\n</ref> An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wings]], [[Group (military aviation unit)|groups]], or [[Command (military formation)|commands]], as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]].

The first two commands established, in March 1940, were Southern Area, which essentially took over the role and headquarters of No.&nbsp;1 Group in Melbourne, and Central Area, which evolved from No.&nbsp;2 Group in Sydney.
