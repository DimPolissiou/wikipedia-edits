When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress. After he awakens in the hospital, Dr. Hartman connects him with a \"[[yacht rock]]\" music collection to help him relax. When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship. Struggling to survive, everyone has to make their way towards the bottom of the ship where the hull is the thinnest. When they finally reach their goal and meet up with Brian in the process, they realize that they have no tools to cut through the hull.

But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.\n\nHe was the second son of [[Vlad Dracul]], who became the ruler of [[Wallachia]] in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], were held as hostages in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. Vlad's father and eldest brother, [[Mircea II of Wallachia|Mircea]], were murdered after [[John Hunyadi]], regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav{{nbsp}}II]], as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to [[Moldavia]] in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.\n\nRelations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the [[Wallachian boyars]] to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who supported his opponents, [[Dan III of Wallachia|Dan]] and [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n|Basarab Laiot\u0103]] (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] half-brother, [[Vlad the Monk]]. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them [[Impalement|impaled]] (which inspired his [[cognomen]]). Peace was restored in 1460.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Mehmed II]], ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. Vlad [[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte|attempted to capture the sultan]] at [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] during the night of 16{{ndash}}17{{nbsp}}June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.\n\nVlad was held in captivity in [[Visegr\u00e1d]] from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot\u0103 (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10{{nbsp}}January 1477. Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlad's reputation for cruelty and his [[patronymic]] inspired the name of the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]], for whom, however, he did not serve as the general inspiration, in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{further|House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti}}\n\n[[File:Vlad Dracul.jpg|thumb|right|Vlad's father, [[Vlad Dracul]]]]\n\nThe expression ''Dracula'', which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional [[vampire]], was for centuries known as the [[sobriquet]] of Vlad{{nbsp}}III.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=16}} Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as ''Dracula'', ''Dracuglia'', or ''Drakula'' already in the 15th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}} He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=229}} His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, [[Vlad Dracul]] (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in [[Romanian language#Early history|medieval Romanian]]), who received it after he became a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]].{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}} Dracula is the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of Dracul, meaning \"[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\".{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} In modern Romanian, ''dracul'' means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}}\n\nVlad III is known as ''Vlad \u021aepe\u0219'' (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} This sobriquet is connected to the [[impalement]] that was his favorite method of execution.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} The Ottoman writer [[Tursun Beg]] referred to him as ''{{lang|ota-Latn|Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 [[Voivode|Voyvoda]]}}'' (Impaler Lord) around 1500.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} [[Mircea the Shepherd]], Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1{{nbsp}}April 1551.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=189}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nVlad was the second legitimate son of [[Vlad II Dracul]], who was an illegitimate son of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]].

He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.\n\nHe was the second son of [[Vlad Dracul]], who became the ruler of [[Wallachia]] in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], were held as hostages in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. Vlad's father and eldest brother, [[Mircea II of Wallachia|Mircea]], were murdered after [[John Hunyadi]], regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav{{nbsp}}II]], as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to [[Moldavia]] in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.\n\nRelations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the [[Wallachian boyars]] to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who supported his opponents, [[Dan III of Wallachia|Dan]] and [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n|Basarab Laiot\u0103]] (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] half-brother, [[Vlad the Monk]]. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them [[Impalement|impaled]] (which inspired his [[cognomen]]). Peace was restored in 1460.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Mehmed II]], ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. Vlad [[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte|attempted to capture the sultan]] at [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] during the night of 16{{ndash}}17{{nbsp}}June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.\n\nVlad was held in captivity in [[Visegr\u00e1d]] from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot\u0103 (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10{{nbsp}}January 1477. Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlad's reputation for cruelty and his [[patronymic]] inspired the name of the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]], for whom, however, he did not serve as the general inspiration, in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{further|House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti}}\n\n[[File:Vlad Dracul.jpg|thumb|right|Vlad's father, [[Vlad Dracul]]]]\n\nThe expression ''Dracula'', which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional [[vampire]], was for centuries known as the [[sobriquet]] of Vlad{{nbsp}}III.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=16}} Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as ''Dracula'', ''Dracuglia'', or ''Drakula'' already in the 15th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}} He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=229}} His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, [[Vlad Dracul]] (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in [[Romanian language#Early history|medieval Romanian]]), who received it after he became a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]].{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}} Dracula is the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of Dracul, meaning \"[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\".{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} In modern Romanian, ''dracul'' means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}}\n\nVlad III is known as ''Vlad \u021aepe\u0219'' (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} This sobriquet is connected to the [[impalement]] that was his favorite method of execution.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} The Ottoman writer [[Tursun Beg]] referred to him as ''{{lang|ota-Latn|Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 [[Voivode|Voyvoda]]}}'' (Impaler Lord) around 1500.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} [[Mircea the Shepherd]], Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1{{nbsp}}April 1551.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=189}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nVlad was the second legitimate son of [[Vlad II Dracul]], who was an illegitimate son of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]].

Consequently, Stoker borrowed the name and \"scraps of miscellaneous information\" about the history of Wallachia when writing his book about Count Dracula.{{sfn|Cain|2006|p=182}}\n\n== Appearance and representations ==\n\nPope Pius II's legate, Niccol\u00f2 Modrussa, painted the only extant description of Vlad, whom he had met in Buda.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|pp=85, 161}} A copy of Vlad's portrait has been featured in the \"monster portrait gallery\" in the [[Ambras Castle]] at [[Innsbruck]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=84}} The picture depicts \"a strong, cruel, and somehow tortured man\" with \"large, deep-set, [[Eye color#green|dark green]], and penetrating eyes\", according to Florescu.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=84}} The color of Vlad's hair cannot be determined, because Modrussa mentions that Vlad was black-haired, while the portrait seems to show that he had fair hair.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=84}} The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=84}}\n\nVlad's bad reputation in the German-speaking territories can be detected in a number of Renaissance paintings.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=204}} He was portrayed among the witnesses of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew's]] martyrdom in a 15th-century painting, displayed in the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=204}} A figure similar to Vlad is one of the witnesses of Christ in the [[Calvary]] in a chapel of the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=204}}\n\n{{Quote|[Vlad] was not very tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cold and terrible appearance, a strong and aquiline nose, swollen nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the very long eyelashes framed large wide-open green eyes; the bushy black eyebrows made them appear threatening.

These three events together make up the ''Triple Crown Series'' with each individual tournament referred to as a Triple Crown event. The individual events are deemed to be the most reputable, despite not always being worth the most ranking points or prize fund. Players who win all three tournaments are said to have \"won the Triple Crown\", either over their career, or in one season alone. The Triple Crown dates back to the [[1969 World Snooker Championship]], when the event changed reverted to a knockout format from the prior \"challenge\" basis.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, 11 players have won all three events, with both [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] winning each event five times or more. O'Sullivan has the most titles, having won 19 individual tournaments. Three players have won all three in the space of a season, with [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]], [[Steve Davis]] each and Hendry having done so on two occasions. Shortly before the start of the [[2020 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] tournament in January 2020, the name was officialised as part of a \"Triple Crown series\", with any player who had won the Triple Crown in the past being able to adorn their waistcoat with a crown symbolising their achievements.\n\n==History==\nThe \"Triple Crown\" status has been retrospectively given to events from 1969, when the [[World Snooker Championship]] returned to being a [[single elimination]] tournament, rather than the challenge format that had previously been used.<ref name=\"euro_Davi\" />  Snooker championships held after this date are considered part of the \"modern era\" of the professional game.<ref name=\"euro_Davi\" /> Six years later, a non-ranking invitational event, the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]], was introduced; there were 10 competitors in the [[1975 Masters (snooker)|inaugural Masters]] in 1975, and this number later increased to 16 players.<ref name=\"0iJqj\" /> [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] won the 1975 Masters tournament, becoming the first person to win two Triple Crown events, having won the world championships in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] and [[1971 World Snooker Championship|1971]].<ref name=\"theg_Obit\" /> The following year, [[Ray Reardon]] won both the [[1976 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] and [[1976 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in the same season.<ref name=\"CNi0A\" /><ref name=\"nI8HI\" />\n\nIn 1977, a third Triple Crown event was created, the [[UK Championship]].

[[Jimmy White]], [[Matthew Stevens]] and [[Ding Junhui]] all need to win the World Championships having won The Masters and UK Championships. The three have lost nine World Finals between them, six by White. White has not appeared at The Crucible since [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006]]. [[Peter Ebdon]] needs to win The Masters to add to his World and UK Championships and complete the Triple Crown. As of 2020, though, he has not qualified for the London event since [[2011 Masters (snooker)|2011]]. [[Stuart Bingham]] needs to win the UK Championship, having a World title and a Masters championship to his name. [[John Parrott]] won both the UK and World Titles in his career, before retiring, but never managed to win the Masters. Parrott reached three Masters finals in four years between 1989 and 1992 but was defeated by Hendry on each occasion. Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Dennis Taylor won the World Championship and the Masters but none of them won the UK Championship. [[Cliff Thorburn]] won one World Championship and three Masters titles. As a Canadian he was ineligible to play in the UK Championship until it became an open event in [[1984 UK Championship|1984]]. His best result in the UK Championship was a semi-final finish in his first appearance in 1984. [[Doug Mountjoy]] won the UK Championship (twice) and the Masters, but never won the World Championship, losing to Steve Davis in the [[1981 World Snooker Championship|1981]] final.\n\n==Tournament

(sometimes called '''snooker's majors''') in [[snooker]] is winning the three most prestigious tournaments; the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], the [[UK Championship]], and the invitational [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]]. These three events together make up the ''Triple Crown Series'' with each individual tournament referred to as a Triple Crown event. The individual events are deemed to be the most reputable, despite not always being worth the most ranking points or prize fund. Players who win all three tournaments are said to have \"won the Triple Crown\", either over their career, or in one season alone. The Triple Crown dates back to the [[1969 World Snooker Championship]], when the event changed reverted to a knockout format from the prior \"challenge\" basis.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, 11 players have won all three events, with both [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] winning each event five times or more. O'Sullivan has the most titles, having won 19 individual tournaments. Three players have won all three in the space of a season, with [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]], [[Steve Davis]] each and Hendry having done so on two occasions. Shortly before the start of the [[2020 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] tournament in January 2020, the name was officialised as part of a \"Triple Crown series\", with any player who had won the Triple Crown in the past being able to adorn their waistcoat with a crown symbolising their achievements.\n\n==History==\nThe \"Triple Crown\" status has been retrospectively given to events from 1969, when the [[World Snooker Championship]] returned to being a [[single elimination]] tournament, rather than the challenge format that had previously been used.<ref name=\"euro_Davi\" />  Snooker championships held after this date are considered part of the \"modern era\" of the professional game.<ref name=\"euro_Davi\" /> Six years later, a non-ranking invitational event, the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]], was introduced; there were 10 competitors in the [[1975 Masters (snooker)|inaugural Masters]] in 1975, and this number later increased to 16 players.<ref name=\"0iJqj\" /> [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] won the 1975 Masters tournament, becoming the first person to win two Triple Crown events, having won the world championships in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] and [[1971 World Snooker Championship|1971]].<ref name=\"theg_Obit\" /> The following year, [[Ray Reardon]] won both the [[1976 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] and [[1976 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in the same season.<ref name=\"CNi0A\" /><ref name=\"nI8HI\" />\n\nIn 1977, a third Triple Crown event was created, the [[UK Championship]].

[[Jimmy White]], [[Matthew Stevens]] and [[Ding Junhui]] all need to win the World Championships having won The Masters and UK Championships. The three have lost nine World Finals between them, six by White. White has not appeared at The Crucible since [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006]]. [[Peter Ebdon]] needs to win The Masters to add to his World and UK Championships and complete the Triple Crown. As of 2020, though, he has not qualified for the London event since [[2011 Masters (snooker)|2011]]. [[Stuart Bingham]] needs to win the UK Championship, having a World title and a Masters championship to his name. [[John Parrott]] won both the UK and World Titles in his career, before retiring, but never managed to win the Masters. Parrott reached three Masters finals in four years between 1989 and 1992 but was defeated by Hendry on each occasion. Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Dennis Taylor won the World Championship and the Masters but none of them won the UK Championship. [[Cliff Thorburn]] won one World Championship and three Masters titles. As a Canadian he was ineligible to play in the UK Championship until it became an open event in [[1984 UK Championship|1984]]. His best result in the UK Championship was a semi-final finish in his first appearance in 1984. [[Doug Mountjoy]] won the UK Championship (twice) and the Masters, but never won the World Championship, losing to Steve Davis in the [[1981 World Snooker Championship|1981]] final.\n\n==Tournament

Christopher Bell, an associate professor of media studies at the [[University of Colorado]] has called Kidz Bop \"an abomination\" because it censors language but not content, altering specific words without changing or obscuring the underlying tone or meaning. He explained: \"I don't need a sanitized version of \"[[Despacito]]\" \u2014 I need 8-year-olds not to be singing \"Despacito\" because that [song] is super dirty.

Christopher Bell, an associate professor of media studies at the [[University of Colorado]] has called Kidz Bop \"an abomination\" because it censors language but not content, altering specific words without changing or obscuring the underlying tone or meaning. He explained: \"I don't need a sanitized version of \"[[Despacito]]\" \u2014 I need 8-year-olds not to be singing \"Despacito\" because that [song] is super dirty.

{"title_page": "List of snooker players by number of ranking titles", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a list of professional [[snooker]] players ordered by the number of \"ranking titles\" they have won. A ranking title is a tournament which counts towards the [[snooker world rankings]]. World rankings were introduced in [[1976\u201377 snooker season|1976\u201377]], initially based on the results from the previous three [[World Snooker Championship|World Championships]]. The first ranking event was thus the [[1974 World Snooker Championship|1974 World Championship]], won by [[Ray Reardon]].\n\nUntil 1982 the World Championship was the only ranking event. In the [[1982\u201383 snooker season|1982\u201383 season]], two more ranking events were added to the snooker calendar: the [[1982 International Open|International Open]] and the [[1982 Professional Players Tournament|Professional Players Tournament]]. In 1984, the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], initially a non-ranking tournament, became a ranking event for the first time. Over the years more ranking tournaments were established. In the [[2018\u201319 snooker season|2018\u201319 season]] there were twenty events worth ranking points.\n\nIn [[1992\u201393 snooker season|1992\u201393]] and from the [[2010\u201311 snooker season|2010\u201311]] to the [[2015\u201316 snooker season|2015\u201316 season]] there were a number of tournaments which contribute to the world rankings but at a lower rate than standard ranking tournaments. Wins in these tournaments are referred to as \"minor-ranking titles\". All the minor-ranking tournaments from 2010 to 2016 were part of the [[Players Tour Championship]].\n\n[[Stephen Hendry]] and [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] jointly hold the record for the most ranking titles with 36.<ref name=\"World Snooker (2007, Snooker Stats)\"/><ref name=\"World Snooker (2010, Snooker Stats)\"/>\n\n==List of winners==\n:''Following the [[2020 Gibraltar

professional [[snooker]] players ordered by the number of \"ranking titles\" they have won. A ranking title is a tournament which counts towards the [[snooker world rankings]]. World rankings were introduced in [[Snooker season 1976/1977|1976/77]], initially based on the results from the previous three [[World Snooker Championship|World Championships]]. The first ranking event was thus the [[1974 World Snooker Championship|1974 World Championship]], won by [[Ray Reardon]].\n\nUntil 1982 the World Championship was the only ranking event. In the [[Snooker season 1982/1983|1982/1983 season]], two more ranking events were added to the snooker calendar: the [[1982 International Open|International Open]] and the [[1982 Professional Players Tournament|Professional Players Tournament]]. In 1984, the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], initially a non-ranking tournament, became a ranking event for the first time. Over the years more ranking tournaments were established. In the [[Snooker season 2018/2019|2018/2019 season]] there were twenty events worth ranking points.\n\nIn [[Snooker season 1992/1993|1992/93]] and from the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/11]] to the [[Snooker season 2015/2016|2015/16 season]] there were a number of tournaments which contribute to the world rankings but at a lower rate than standard ranking tournaments.
