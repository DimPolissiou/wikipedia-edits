The coastal region is largely rough hill country, known locally as the [[Hakarimata Range]], though it is more gently undulating in the north, closer to the mouth of the Waikato River. The coast is punctured by three large natural harbours: [[Raglan Harbour]], [[Aotea Harbour]], and [[Kawhia Harbour]]. The area around Raglan is noted for its [[volcano|volcanic]] black sand beaches and for its fine [[surfing]] conditions at Manu Bay and [[Ruapuke]] beach.\n\nTo the east of the coastal hills lies the broad [[floodplain]] of the Waikato River. This region has a wet temperate climate, and the land is largely pastoral farmland created by European settlers draining the extensive natural swamps, although it also contains undrained [[peat]] [[swamp]] such as the 200km2 peat dome south of Ngatea. It is in the broad undulating [[Waikato Plains]] that most of the region's population resides, and the land is intensively farmed with both livestock, mainly [[dairy]] cattle but with sheep farming on the hillier west margins, and crops such as [[maize]]. The area around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] has many [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred]] stables.\n\nThe north of the region around [[Te Kauwhata]] produces some of New Zealand's best [[wine]]s. Dozens of small  shallow lakes lie in this area, the largest of which is [[Lake Waikare]].\n\nTo the east, the land rises towards the forested slopes of the [[Kaimai Range|Kaimai]] and [[Mamaku Ranges]]. The upper reaches of the Waikato River are used for [[hydroelectricity]], helped by several large artificial lakes in the region's south-east. The lowest and earliest-created such lake is [[Lake Karapiro]], now developed as a world-class rowing centre, where the world championships were held in 2010. The river flows out of the country's largest lake, [[Lake Taup\u014d]], which is served by several important fishing rivers such as the [[Tongariro River|Tongariro]], on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Central Plateau]], draining the eastern side of [[Mount Ruapehu]] and its neighbours.\n\nThe climate is mild and temperate with moderate rainfall of 1200\u20131600mm per annum, with the higher western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with typical maximum temperatures of 22\u201328 degrees Celsius and overnight lows of 12-16 degrees. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Typical winter maxima are 10\u201316 degrees Celsius, with lows generally ranging from 0-8 degrees. Depressions experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains to the west and south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK. This results in rapid growth of grass, crops and ornamental plants.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Main|List of localities in Waikato}}\n\n[[File:WaikatoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of population density in the Waikato region (2006 census)]]\nThe largest city in the Waikato Region is [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], with an urban population of {{NZ population data 2018|Hamilton|y|y||(|)}}.<ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\"/> It is home to the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] (Wintec).\n\nOther major towns in the region are [[Tokoroa]], [[Te Awamutu]], [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] and [[Taup\u014d]] with respective populations of {{NZ population data 2018|Tokoroa|y}}, {{NZ population data 2018|Te Awamutu|y}}, {{NZ population data 2018|Cambridge|y}} and {{NZ population data 2018|Taupo|y}}.

is the fourth largest regional economy in New Zealand after [[Auckland Region]], [[Canterbury Region]] and [[Wellington Region]]. Gross regional product (GRP) for the year ended March 2007 was estimated to be $15,606 million compared with $12,493 million in March 2004.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/|title=2009 Waikato Economic Report|publisher=[[Waikato Regional Council]]|year=2009|accessdate=18 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234312/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/|archive-date=19 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Waikato economic growth was lower than the national average. But from 2004 to 2007, real gross regional product for the Waikato Region increased by 5 per cent per year compared with 3.2 per cent for the national average. This faster growth can be attributed to rapidly growing dairy and business services industries, facilitated by proximity to the Auckland city, the main international gateway for New Zealand.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\"/>\n\nGiven the suitable geography and climate, the Waikato economy is strongly based on agriculture, especially dairy. Dairy farming has been the main agricultural activity since the late nineteenth century. Within the Waikato region, small co-operative dairy companies were widespread during the 20th century.  Towards the end of the 20th century, frequent mergers of co-operative dairy companies occurred, which ultimately ended in the formation of New Zealand wide dairy co-operative [[Fonterra]] in 2001. In 2007, dairy farming and dairy processing combined contributed $2 billion (13%) to GRP, which had risen to $2.4bn by 2014, but only 13,683 (7.6%) of jobs in 2016.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf|title=QuickStats about dairying \u2013 WAIKATO REGION|last=|first=|date=June 2016|website=DairyNZ Economics Group|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424145208/https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf|archive-date=24 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Business services is the second largest sector in the Waikato Region, contributing $1.2 billion or 8 per cent of GRP in 2007\n\nDairy farms are mainly family owned (2,608 of 4,020 farms in 2016) with owners employing [[Sharemilking|sharemilkers]] in many cases (1,412 sharemilkers).<ref name=\":5\" /> The size of the average dairy herd in the Waikato has progressively increased.

The cows are kept on grassland pasture all year due to the mild climate. In the Waikato the original English grasses used by earlier settlers \u2013 [[browntop]], [[fescue]] and [[Yorkshire Fog]] \u2013 have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. Farmers use a variety of supplementary feeds in winter or during the infrequent summer droughts. Main feeds are hay, grass silage and chopped corn feed. The later is often fed out on a concrete pad to save transportation and wastage by trampling.\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Waikato contained the third most densely populated part of New Zealand, after Northland/Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. The Waikato ''rohe'' (area) was inhabited by ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) such as those of the [[Tainui]] confederation, including [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Toa]] who conquered the native inhabitants about 1450 according to Tainui historians, finally destroying them at a battle at Aratiatia. Between about 1750 and 1842 the area was subject to a large number of invasions by other M\u0101ori iwi and hapu confederations and large scale population migrations took place by a number of ''[[hapu]]'' and ''iwi''. The largest battle ever fought in New Zealand took place near Ohaupo about 1790\u20131805, between two competing alliances of ''hapu''. During the latter stages of this volatile period, known as the [[Musket Wars]] (1807\u20131845), conflict led to a migration south to [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] and eventually Kapiti Island.\n\nIn 1840 44 Waikato chiefs travelled north to the Manukau Heads and Manukau Harbour to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, officially making the Waikato area part of New Zealand. Three Ngati Maniapoto chiefs signed, as did three Ngati Haua chiefs but most signatories were Waikato. Chief Te Whero whero did not sign, \"probably due to the lack of dignity compared to the Waitangi event\". Unusually, the copy signed was in English.<ref>NZ History. Waikato -Manakau Treaty copy. Updated 19 Feb. 2016.</ref> Between 1840 and 1860 the CMS missionaries of the Anglican church assisted Waikato Maori in revolutionizing their economy in the Kihikihi area by the introduction of such crops as peaches, maize and wheat.\n\nMissionaries brought in millers and helped Maori establish eight flour mills. These flourished until 1857, as they provided flour for the growing Auckland market in the 1850s and for a brief while were exporting to Australia. There were mills at [[Aotea Harbour|Aotea]], [[Mount Taupiri|Kaitotehe]], Karakariki, [[Kihikihi]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Kirikiriroa]], Kohanga, Kopatauaki, [[K\u0101whia Harbour|Mahoe]], Mangaharakeke, Mangapapa, Mangarewarewa, [[Mangatawhiri River|Mangatawhiri]], [[Waharoa|Matamata]] p\u0101, [[Maungakawa]], [[Maungatautari]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=3122#|title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: Maori Flour Mills Of The Auckland Province, 1846-1860, By R.

Near the Waikato Heads travellers entered the small [[Awaroa River (Waikato River tributary)|Awaroa River]]. During summer it was necessary to push or pull the waka through to the Manukau Harbour at Waiuku. By 1850s a small bullock track had been established to Auckland via the settlements of Mauku, Drury, Papakura and Otahuhu, or [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] could take the sea route across the Manukau to Ihumatao (where Auckland International Airport is now).<ref>J. Gorst. The Maori King, P11 and Map. Reed. 2001.</ref> The main tribe to use this route and the main traders were the Maniapoto tribe. They occupied an area of fertile land south of Te Awamutu at Kihikihi and Rangiaowhia.  Maniapoto sold wheat, peaches, potatoes and other food to Auckland and bought back shirts, sugar, tobacco and rum.<ref>J. Gorst. The Maori King. P13. Reed 2001</ref> The boom time ended in 1856\u20131857 with the end of the Australian gold rush, allowing importing of cheaper food, especially flour, from Australia. Even in the boom time of 1854\u201355, food grown by Waikato Maori, such as Ngati Maniapoto, was taken to the Auckland market in very small amounts compared to food from the Waiheke Island -Thames area. In early 1855 Ngati Maniapoto took only 3 canoes of potatoes to Auckland compared to 279 canoes containing a much wider variety of food from the Thames area.<ref>Maori Enterprise to c1860. Hazel Petrie.</ref> Missionaries had also established schools for Maori. Benjamin and Harriet Ashwell ran a school for 50 Maori girls aged 6\u201317 at Taupiri in 1853. The girls had been at the school for up to 3 years and could read and write in English and do mental arithmetic.<ref>The Voyagers.P Moon. p 62. Penguin 2014.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Invasion of Waikato|Waikato campaign]] of 1863 against the rebel [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] forces, the population was estimated by the government at about 3,500 M\u0101ori.\n\nDuring the late 1850s Maniapoto in particular become disgruntled in their dealings with Pakeha. They complained about the way they were treated in Auckland by traders but their chief complaint was that the government was underpaying them for land they were selling. The average price paid by government was 6d per acre but it was sold to settlers for 10/- per acre. The government argued that it had to pay for surveying and administration costs but to Maori it seemed unfair. Before the elevation of the first Maori king there was a wide range of opinions among influential Maori with some such as Wirimu Tamihana's father advocating supporting the Crown while Te Heuheu of Tuwharetoa advocated all out war against the government.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King p 34, 35, 40. Reed 2001.</ref> This view was initially unpopular as the king movement hoped to work alongside the crown. Maori were upset at the number of children that had been fathered by Pakeha, who had then disappeared. The children were left to be raised by their mothers with general hapu support. John Gorst, a well-educated government agent, reported significant numbers of half-caste children in the Waikato in the late 1850s. However, in the Ngati Maniapoto iwi at least 7 Pakeha integrated successfully with the tribe from 1842, marrying Maori women. The best known are William Searancke, who became an important government agent, and Frenchman Louis Hetet, who became a successful trader. Their half-caste children lived with the iwi, and some became leading figures.\n\nWhat tipped the balance was conflict and criminal activity within the Waikato region. Influential chiefs said the treaty had promised the government would help maintain peace. They asked for government magistrates and courts. The government attempted to fulfill these requests but many of the young men who put themselves forward  for the positions simply saw that they had an opportunity to get wealthy at the government's expense. This upset the older chiefs, who wanted the strong Maori leader Te Wherowhero to return from Mangere to his lands at Tamahere (South Hamilton) to rein in the out-of-control young chief magistrates.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King. P 39-49. Reed 2001.</ref>\n\nThe Waikato has a prominent history, particularly regarding relationships between M\u0101ori and European in early colonial New Zealand. The Waikato was within the defined boundaries of the colonial provinces of [[New Ulster Province|New Ulster]] (1841\u20131853) and [[Auckland Province|Auckland]] (1853\u20131876) but was principally M\u0101ori. During the [[New Zealand wars|land wars]] of the 1860s, the Waikato was the scene of five battles in what is referred to as the [[Invasion of the Waikato]]. In retaliation for the help Waikato M\u0101ori (mainly [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]]) gave Taranaki M\u0101ori in their conflict over land in the earlier [[First Taranaki War]], and the decision by some Waikato ''hapu'' to form a separate kingdom \u2013 the King Movement or ''Kingitanga'' \u2013 in opposition to the government, the colonial government, with the help of troops brought from Britain and Queenite M\u0101ori loyal to the Crown, pushed south from the main settlement of [[Auckland]], fighting against Waikato raiders in Auckland before venturing into the Waikato to attack the combined ''hapu'' of the King Movement. During 1863 and 1864 fighting occurred at Pukekohe East, Titi hill, Burtts Farm, Galloway Redoubt, Kiri Kiri, Martyn's Farm, Patumahoe, Rhodes Clearing, Williamson's Clearing, Otau, Camerontown, Kakaramea and Wairoa ranges (all Auckland), [[Meremere]], Rangiriri, Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia, Rangiaowhia (southwest of Cambridge), Hairini Ridge and \u014cr\u0101kau (near Kihikihi), all resulting in defeat for the ''Kingitanga'' forces. Eventually the rebel King Movement forces pulled back to positions in the area to the south of the Punui River in South Waikato, still known as the [[King Country]], after 19 defeats by the British. ''[[Rewi's Last Stand]]'', one of New Zealand's first [[motion pictures]], in 1925, portrayed an entertaining, fictionalized version of the \u014cr\u0101kau siege.\n\nThe headquarters of the M\u0101ori King Movement are now at [[Turangawaewae]] Marae at [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]].\n\nAfter the end of the war and the withdrawal of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Maori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900, dairy production in the Waikato continued to grow, exporting butter and cheese mainly to Britain.\n\n=== Local government history ===\nFollowing major floods in 1907,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://docs.niwa.co.nz/library/public/w&smp48.pdf|title=Catchment Control in New Zealand|last=Poole|first=A.

sporting endeavours. The word was likely first applied to the [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato provincial rugby team]]. Its origin is related to the mascot of a pantomime-like milking cow used in parades, public events and sports matches \u2014 particularly rugby, reflecting the importance of the dairy industry to the region. Waikato hosts the [[Chiefs (Super rugby franchise)|Chiefs]] Super Rugby team and [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]] Mitre 10 Cup rugby team at [[Waikato Stadium]] and the [[Northern Districts Knights]] in domestic cricket at [[Seddon Park]], both in Hamilton.\n\n=== Notable people ===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jim Bolger]] &mdash; former Prime Minister of New Zealand\n* [[Roy Calvert]] &mdash; WWII pilot\n* [[Helen Clark]] &mdash; former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]\n* [[Don Clarke]] &mdash; [[Rugby Union|rugby]] international\n* [[The Datsuns]] &mdash; rock band\n* [[Tim Finn|Tim]] and [[Neil Finn]] &mdash; songwriters and musicians ([[Split Enz]], [[Crowded House]])\n* [[Rob Hamill]] &mdash; champion rower and author.\n* [[Te Puea Herangi]] &mdash; [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] princess and leader\n* [[Rangimarie Hetet]] &mdash; of Oparure Marae.

But this usually refers to a smaller region than the Waikato local government region.

The coastal region is largely rough hill country, known locally as the [[Hakarimata Range]], though it is more gently undulating in the north, closer to the mouth of the Waikato River. The coast is punctured by three large natural harbours: [[Raglan Harbour]], [[Aotea Harbour]], and [[Kawhia Harbour]]. The area around Raglan is noted for its [[volcano|volcanic]] black sand beaches and for its fine [[surfing]] conditions at Manu Bay and [[Ruapuke]] beach.\n\nTo the east of the coastal hills lies the broad [[floodplain]] of the Waikato River. This region has a wet temperate climate, and the land is largely pastoral farmland created by European settlers draining the extensive natural swamps, although it also contains undrained [[peat]] [[swamp]] such as the 200km2 peat dome south of Ngatea. It is in the broad undulating [[Waikato Plains]] that most of the region's population resides, and the land is intensively farmed with both livestock, mainly [[dairy]] cattle but with sheep farming on the hillier west margins, and crops such as [[maize]]. The area around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] has many [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred]] stables.\n\nThe north of the region around [[Te Kauwhata]] produces some of New Zealand's best [[wine]]s. Dozens of small  shallow lakes lie in this area, the largest of which is [[Lake Waikare]].\n\nTo the east, the land rises towards the forested slopes of the [[Kaimai Range|Kaimai]] and [[Mamaku Ranges]]. The upper reaches of the Waikato River are used for [[hydroelectricity]], helped by several large artificial lakes in the region's south-east. The lowest and earliest-created such lake is [[Lake Karapiro]], now developed as a world-class rowing centre, where the world championships were held in 2010. The river flows out of the country's largest lake, [[Lake Taup\u014d]], which is served by several important fishing rivers such as the [[Tongariro River|Tongariro]], on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Central Plateau]], draining the eastern side of [[Mount Ruapehu]] and its neighbours.\n\nThe climate is mild and temperate with moderate rainfall of 1200\u20131600mm per annum, with the higher western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with typical maximum temperatures of 22\u201328 degrees Celsius and overnight lows of 12-16 degrees. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Typical winter maxima are 10\u201316 degrees Celsius, with lows generally ranging from 0-8 degrees. Depressions experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains to the west and south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK. This results in rapid growth of grass, crops and ornamental plants.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Main|List of localities in Waikato}}\n\n[[File:WaikatoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of population density in the Waikato region (2006 census)]]\nThe largest city in the Waikato Region is [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], with an urban population of {{NZ population data 2018|Hamilton|y|y||(|)}}.<ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\"/> It is home to the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] (Wintec).\n\nOther major towns in the region are [[Tokoroa]], [[Te Awamutu]], [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] and [[Taup\u014d]] with respective populations of {{NZ population data 2018|Tokoroa|y}}, {{NZ population data 2018|Te Awamutu|y}}, {{NZ population data 2018|Cambridge|y}} and {{NZ population data 2018|Taupo|y}}.

is the fourth largest regional economy in New Zealand after [[Auckland Region]], [[Canterbury Region]] and [[Wellington Region]]. Gross regional product (GRP) for the year ended March 2007 was estimated to be $15,606 million compared with $12,493 million in March 2004.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/|title=2009 Waikato Economic Report|publisher=[[Waikato Regional Council]]|year=2009|accessdate=18 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234312/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/|archive-date=19 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Waikato economic growth was lower than the national average. But from 2004 to 2007, real gross regional product for the Waikato Region increased by 5 per cent per year compared with 3.2 per cent for the national average. This faster growth can be attributed to rapidly growing dairy and business services industries, facilitated by proximity to the Auckland city, the main international gateway for New Zealand.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\"/>\n\nGiven the suitable geography and climate, the Waikato economy is strongly based on agriculture, especially dairy. Dairy farming has been the main agricultural activity since the late nineteenth century. Within the Waikato region, small co-operative dairy companies were widespread during the 20th century.  Towards the end of the 20th century, frequent mergers of co-operative dairy companies occurred, which ultimately ended in the formation of New Zealand wide dairy co-operative [[Fonterra]] in 2001. In 2007, dairy farming and dairy processing combined contributed $2 billion (13%) to GRP, which had risen to $2.4bn by 2014, but only 13,683 (7.6%) of jobs in 2016.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf|title=QuickStats about dairying \u2013 WAIKATO REGION|last=|first=|date=June 2016|website=DairyNZ Economics Group|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424145208/https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf|archive-date=24 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Business services is the second largest sector in the Waikato Region, contributing $1.2 billion or 8 per cent of GRP in 2007\n\nDairy farms are mainly family owned (2,608 of 4,020 farms in 2016) with owners employing [[Sharemilking|sharemilkers]] in many cases (1,412 sharemilkers).<ref name=\":5\" /> The size of the average dairy herd in the Waikato has progressively increased.

The cows are kept on grassland pasture all year due to the mild climate. In the Waikato the original English grasses used by earlier settlers \u2013 [[browntop]], [[fescue]] and [[Yorkshire Fog]] \u2013 have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. Farmers use a variety of supplementary feeds in winter or during the infrequent summer droughts. Main feeds are hay, grass silage and chopped corn feed. The later is often fed out on a concrete pad to save transportation and wastage by trampling.\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Waikato contained the third most densely populated part of New Zealand, after Northland/Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. The Waikato ''rohe'' (area) was inhabited by ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) such as those of the [[Tainui]] confederation, including [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Toa]] who conquered the native inhabitants about 1450 according to Tainui historians, finally destroying them at a battle at Aratiatia. Between about 1750 and 1842 the area was subject to a large number of invasions by other M\u0101ori iwi and hapu confederations and large scale population migrations took place by a number of ''[[hapu]]'' and ''iwi''. The largest battle ever fought in New Zealand took place near Ohaupo about 1790-1805, between two competing alliances of ''hapu''. During the latter stages of this volatile period, known as the [[Musket Wars]] (1807\u20131845), conflict led to a migration south to [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] and eventually Kapiti Island.\n\nIn 1840 44 Waikato chiefs travelled north to the Manukau Heads and Manukau Harbour to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, officially making the Waikato area part of New Zealand. Three Ngati Maniapoto chiefs signed, as did three Ngati Haua chiefs but most signatories were Waikato. Chief Te Whero whero did not sign, \"probably due to the lack of dignity compared to the Waitangi event\". Unusually, the copy signed was in English.<ref>NZ History. Waikato -Manakau Treaty copy. Updated 19 Feb. 2016.</ref> Between 1840 and 1860 the CMS missionaries of the Anglican church assisted Waikato Maori in revolutionizing their economy in the Kihikihi area by the introduction of such crops as peaches, maize and wheat.\n\nMissionaries brought in millers and helped Maori establish eight flour mills. These flourished until 1857, as they provided flour for the growing Auckland market in the 1850s and for a brief while were exporting to Australia. There were mills at [[Aotea Harbour|Aotea]], [[Mount Taupiri|Kaitotehe]], Karakariki, [[Kihikihi]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Kirikiriroa]], Kohanga, Kopatauaki, [[K\u0101whia Harbour|Mahoe]], Mangaharakeke, Mangapapa, Mangarewarewa, [[Mangatawhiri River|Mangatawhiri]], [[Waharoa|Matamata]] p\u0101, [[Maungakawa]], [[Maungatautari]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=3122#|title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: Maori Flour Mills Of The Auckland Province, 1846-1860, By R.

Near the Waikato Heads travellers entered the small [[Awaroa River (Waikato River tributary)|Awaroa River]]. During summer it was necessary to push or pull the waka through to the Manukau Harbour at Waiuku. By 1850s a small bullock track had been established to Auckland via the settlements of Mauku, Drury, Papakura and Otahuhu, or [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] could take the sea route across the Manukau to Ihumatao (where Auckland International Airport is now).<ref>J. Gorst. The Maori King, P11 and Map. Reed. 2001.</ref> The main tribe to use this route and the main traders were the Maniapoto tribe. They occupied an area of fertile land south of Te Awamutu at Kihikihi and Rangiaowhia.  Maniapoto sold wheat, peaches, potatoes and other food to Auckland and bought back shirts, sugar, tobacco and rum.<ref>J. Gorst. The Maori King. P13. Reed 2001</ref> The boom time ended in 1856-1857 with the end of the Australian gold rush, allowing importing of cheaper food, especially flour, from Australia. Even in the boom time of 1854-55, food grown by Waikato Maori, such as Ngati Maniapoto, was taken to the Auckland market in very small amounts compared to food from the Waiheke Island -Thames area. In early 1855 Ngati Maniapoto took only 3 canoes of potatoes to Auckland compared to 279 canoes containing a much wider variety of food from the Thames area.<ref>Maori Enterprise to c1860. Hazel Petrie.</ref> Missionaries had also established schools for Maori. Benjamin and Harriet Ashwell ran a school for 50 Maori girls aged 6\u201317 at Taupiri in 1853. The girls had been at the school for up to 3 years and could read and write in English and do mental arithmetic.<ref>The Voyagers.P Moon. p 62. Penguin 2014.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Invasion of Waikato|Waikato campaign]] of 1863 against the rebel [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] forces, the population was estimated by the government at about 3,500 M\u0101ori.\n\nDuring the late 1850s Maniapoto in particular become disgruntled in their dealings with Pakeha. They complained about the way they were treated in Auckland by traders but their chief complaint was that the government was underpaying them for land they were selling. The average price paid by government was 6d per acre but it was sold to settlers for 10/- per acre. The government argued that it had to pay for surveying and administration costs but to Maori it seemed unfair. Before the elevation of the first Maori king there was a wide range of opinions among influential Maori with some such as Wirimu Tamihana's father advocating supporting the Crown while Te Heuheu of Tuwharetoa advocated all out war against the government.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King p 34, 35, 40. Reed 2001.</ref> This view was initially unpopular as the king movement hoped to work alongside the crown. Maori were upset at the number of children that had been fathered by Pakeha, who had then disappeared. The children were left to be raised by their mothers with general hapu support. John Gorst, a well-educated government agent, reported significant numbers of half-caste children in the Waikato in the late 1850s. However, in the Ngati Maniapoto iwi at least 7 Pakeha integrated successfully with the tribe from 1842, marrying Maori women. The best known are William Searancke, who became an important government agent, and Frenchman Louis Hetet, who became a successful trader. Their half-caste children lived with the iwi, and some became leading figures.\n\nWhat tipped the balance was conflict and criminal activity within the Waikato region. Influential chiefs said the treaty had promised the government would help maintain peace. They asked for government magistrates and courts. The government attempted to fulfill these requests but many of the young men who put themselves forward  for the positions simply saw that they had an opportunity to get wealthy at the government's expense. This upset the older chiefs, who wanted the strong Maori leader Te Wherowhero to return from Mangere to his lands at Tamahere (South Hamilton) to rein in the out-of-control young chief magistrates.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King. P 39-49. Reed 2001.</ref>\n\nThe Waikato has a prominent history, particularly regarding relationships between M\u0101ori and European in early colonial New Zealand. The Waikato was within the defined boundaries of the colonial provinces of [[New Ulster Province|New Ulster]] (1841\u20131853) and [[Auckland Province|Auckland]] (1853\u20131876) but was principally M\u0101ori. During the [[New Zealand wars|land wars]] of the 1860s, the Waikato was the scene of five battles in what is referred to as the [[Invasion of the Waikato]]. In retaliation for the help Waikato M\u0101ori (mainly [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]]) gave Taranaki M\u0101ori in their conflict over land in the earlier [[First Taranaki War]], and the decision by some Waikato ''hapu'' to form a separate kingdom \u2013 the King Movement or ''Kingitanga'' \u2013 in opposition to the government, the colonial government, with the help of troops brought from Britain and Queenite M\u0101ori loyal to the Crown, pushed south from the main settlement of [[Auckland]], fighting against Waikato raiders in Auckland before venturing into the Waikato to attack the combined ''hapu'' of the King Movement. During 1863 and 1864 fighting occurred at Pukekohe East, Titi hill, Burtts Farm, Galloway Redoubt, Kiri Kiri, Martyn's Farm, Patumahoe, Rhodes Clearing, Williamson's Clearing, Otau, Camerontown, Kakaramea and Wairoa ranges (all Auckland), [[Meremere]], Rangiriri, Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia, Rangiaowhia (southwest of Cambridge), Hairini Ridge and \u014cr\u0101kau (near Kihikihi), all resulting in defeat for the ''Kingitanga'' forces. Eventually the rebel King Movement forces pulled back to positions in the area to the south of the Punui River in South Waikato, still known as the [[King Country]], after 19 defeats by the British. ''[[Rewi's Last Stand]]'', one of New Zealand's first [[motion pictures]], in 1925, portrayed an entertaining, fictionalized version of the \u014cr\u0101kau siege.\n\nThe headquarters of the M\u0101ori King Movement are now at [[Turangawaewae]] Marae at [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]].\n\nAfter the end of the war and the withdrawal of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Maori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900, dairy production in the Waikato continued to grow, exporting butter and cheese mainly to Britain.\n\n=== Local government history ===\nFollowing major floods in 1907,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://docs.niwa.co.nz/library/public/w&smp48.pdf|title=Catchment Control in New Zealand|last=Poole|first=A.

sporting endeavours. The word was likely first applied to the [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato provincial rugby team]]. Its origin is related to the mascot of a pantomime-like milking cow used in parades, public events and sports matches \u2014 particularly rugby, reflecting the importance of the dairy industry to the region.

Sonic Team is best known for the long-running ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and games such as ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'' and ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]''.\n\nThe initial team, formed in 1990, was composed of staff from Sega's Consumer Development division, including programmer [[Yuji Naka]], artist [[Naoto Ohshima]], and level designer [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]]. The team took the name Sonic Team in 1991 with the release of their first game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]],'' for the [[Sega Genesis]]. The game was a major success and contributed to millions of Genesis sales. The next ''Sonic'' games were developed by Naka and Yasuhara in America at [[Sega Technical Institute]], while Ohshima worked on ''[[Sonic CD]]'' in Japan. Naka returned to Japan in late 1994 to become the head of CS3, later renamed R&D No. 8. During this time, the division took on the Sonic Team brand but developed games that do not feature Sonic, such as ''Nights into Dreams'' (1996) and ''[[Burning Rangers]]'' (1998).\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' in 1998, some Sonic Team staff moved to the United States to form Sonic Team USA and develop ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001). With Sega's divestiture of its studios into separate companies, R&D No. 8 became SONICTEAM Ltd. in 2000, with Naka as CEO and Sonic Team USA as its subsidiary. Sega's financial troubles led to several major structural changes in the early 2000s; the United Game Artists studio was absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA became Sega Studios USA in 2004. After [[Sammy Corporation]] purchased Sega in 2004, Sonic Team was reincorporated to become Sega's GE1 research and development department, later renamed CS2.\n\nNaka departed Sonic Team during the development of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' (2006), and Sega Studios USA was merged back into Sonic Team in 2008. The following decade was marked by ''Sonic'' titles of varying reception, with department head [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] acknowledging that Sonic Team had prioritized shipping over quality.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Sega development studios}}\n\n=== 1990: Formation and ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' ===\n[[Image:Yuji Naka' -

Shortly afterward, a number of key employees\u2014including Ohshima\u2014left Sega to form a new studio, [[Artoon]]. Sonic Team achieved success in the [[arcade game]] market in 1999 with the launch of [[rhythm game]] ''[[Samba de Amigo]]'', released the following year for the Dreamcast. The studio also began developing [[online game]]s; in 1999, they released ''[[ChuChu Rocket!]]'', a [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] that made use of the Dreamcast's online capabilities. In 2000, Sonic Team launched the [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' to critical and commercial success.<ref name=\"RetroST\" />\n\nSega began to restructure its studios as part of the dissolution of Sega Enterprises<ref name=\"Edge 89\" /> and spun off its software divisions into subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"RetroST\" />  When the departments took new names, Naka felt it important to preserve the Sonic Team brand name,<ref name=\"RetroST\" /> and the division's new legal name as a company was SONICTEAM, Ltd.<ref name=\"RetroST\" />  Naka was installed as the CEO, and Sonic Team USA became a subsidiary of the new company.<ref name=\"Edge 89\" />\n\nDespite a number of well-received games, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in 2001<ref name=\"RetroST\" /> and exited the hardware business.<ref name=\"gameinformer_sega_nintendo\" /> Sega transitioned into a [[third-party developer]] and began developing games for multiple platforms.<ref name=\"gameinformer_sega_nintendo\" />  From 2000, Sonic Team in Japan began to release fewer games, with a few releases such as the puzzle game [[Puyo Pop (video game)|''Puyo Pop'']] and the action game ''[[Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg]]''. The company changes and lack of a Sega console affected Sonic Team; according to Naka, in a 2006 interview, \"Our approach was always to create strategic title concepts, which included the hardware. We do somewhat miss the idea of being able to address these constant challenges.\"<ref name=\"RetroST\" />\n\nEarly in 2003, Sega president Hideki Sato and COO Tetsu Kamaya announced they were stepping down from their roles, with Sato being replaced by Hisao Oguchi, the head of [[Sega AM3|Hitmaker]].

division. Sonic Team is best known for the long-running ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and games such as ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'' and ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]''.\n\nThe initial team, formed in 1990, was composed of staff from Sega's Consumer Development division, including programmer [[Yuji Naka]], artist [[Naoto Ohshima]], and level designer [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]]. The team took the name Sonic Team in 1991 with the release of their first game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]],'' for the [[Sega Genesis]]. The game was a major success and contributed to millions of Genesis sales. The next ''Sonic'' games were developed by Naka and Yasuhara in America at [[Sega Technical Institute]], while Ohshima worked on ''[[Sonic CD]]'' in Japan. Naka returned to Japan in late 1994 to become the head of CS3, later renamed R&D No. 8. During this time, the division took on the Sonic Team brand but developed games that do not feature Sonic, such as ''Nights into Dreams'' (1996) and ''[[Burning Rangers]]'' (1998).\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' in 1998, some Sonic Team staff moved to the United States to form Sonic Team USA and develop ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001). With Sega's divestiture of its studios into separate companies, R&D No. 8 became SONICTEAM Ltd. in 2000, with Naka as CEO and Sonic Team USA as its subsidiary. Sega's financial troubles led to several major structural changes in the early 2000s; the United Game Artists studio was absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA became Sega Studios USA in 2004. After [[Sammy Corporation]] purchased Sega in 2004, Sonic Team was reincorporated to become Sega's GE1 research and development department, later renamed CS2.\n\nNaka departed Sonic Team during the development of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' (2006), and Sega Studios USA was merged back into Sonic Team in 2008. The following decade was marked by ''Sonic'' titles of varying reception, with department head [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] acknowledging that Sonic Team had prioritized shipping over quality.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Sega development studios}}\n\n=== 1990: Formation and ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' ===\n[[Image:Yuji Naka' -

Sonic Team achieved success in the [[arcade game]] market in 1999 with the launch of [[rhythm game]] ''[[Samba de Amigo]]'', released the following year for the Dreamcast. The studio also began developing [[online game]]s; in 1999, they released ''[[ChuChu Rocket!]]'', a [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] that made use of the Dreamcast's online capabilities.

The club was founded in 2004 and  played in the [[ASB Premiership]]. WaiBOP United played their home fixtures at John Kerkhof Park, Cambridge.<ref>http://www.waibopfootball.co.nz/index.php?id=44&tx_ttnews[pointer]=7&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=605&tx_ttnews[backPid]=43&cHash=776584f631</ref>\n\nThe club was the regional representative for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Football, and also played home fixtures in [[Rotorua]] and [[Mount Maunganui]], both in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region. Between 2008 and 2010, Waikato FC was based at [[Centennial Park, Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia|Centennial Park]] in [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]], having before that played at Waikato Stadium.\n\nFrom the 2014\u201315 season, the club changed its colours and kit to predominantly red and blue to better represent both Waikato and Bay of Plenty.<ref>{{cite web | title= Showing our colours | url = http://www.waibopunited.co.nz/showing-our-colours/ | accessdate = 10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWaikato's first season in existence was a moderately successful one. Playing in the inaugural season of the New Zealand Football Championship, they managed to finish in third place, after a poor start to the campaign.\n\nWaikato's first ever competitive game was away at [[YoungHeart Manawatu]], which they won convincingly 4\u20130 sending them straight to the top of table. Unfortunately they only won one of their next nine games, a run which saw them slide down to seventh in the eight-team league. In a dramatic change of fortunes, Waikato went on to win their next five games, including an away win over eventual champions [[Auckland City FC|Auckland City]]. They only lost two more games during the season and defied pre-season predictions by claiming third place and a spot in the playoffs' \"Elimination Final\" against [[Waitakere United]]. Waikato were crushed 4\u20131 by Waitakare at Trusts Stadium, [[Auckland]], ending their hopes of Championship victory but claiming overall third place was deemed a good achievement for a team that many expected to finish last.\n\nCraig Flowerday won Waikato's Player' Player of the Year award, and goalkeeper Mark Fulcher won Supporters' Player of the Year. David Samson won the Young Player of the Year Award. Striker Colin Gardyne won Sky Sports' Goal of the Season award, and was also Waikato FC's joint-top goalscorer along with Brett Derry.\n\nDespite finishing second bottom of the table, the team showed signs of promise, losing several fixtures by a single goal. Indeed, injuries to key personnel did little to dent the squad's resolve. The move to playing games outside [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], perhaps was not financially successful, as the gate numbers were not as large as expected, but [[Rotorua]] became a fortress with wins over both [[Hawke's Bay United|Hawke's Bay Utd]] and eventual champions [[Auckland City FC|Auckland City]].\n\nFor the start of Season Five the Waikato FC made some bold intentions by signing up [[Kevin Fallon]] to manage the club. From the outside everything at the club seemed fine, but internally the club was in financial strife. Just out from the start of the season the club came out and said that it could no longer afford to compete in the [[NZFC]]. This created a huge outcry amongst the football fraternity. To make the situation worse for the NZFC, [[Team Wellington]] also publicly announced that it too could no longer afford to take part in the competition.\n\nWith the prospect of no [[Waikato]]/[[Bay Of Plenty]] representation at national level, and also the fear that the NZFC would collapse, various people in the football community stepped in to help, some of the most notable being people such as [[Gordon Glen-Watson]] who had played top level football in New Zealand, and [[Wayne Bates]], a [[Ngaruawahia United|Ngaruawahia United AFC]] alumni. Anyone costing the club significant sums of money was let go leaving the club with no playing or coaching staff. To help keep the club alive Ngaruawahia United offered Waikato FC their facilities at [[Centennial Park, Ngaruawahia|Centennial Park]] for training and playing.\n\n[[Dave Edmondson]], Ngaruawahia United's coach, put his name forward to help the team at no cost and [[Graham Pearce (New Zealand footballer)|Graham Pearce]], formally of [[Waitakere United]], came on board and very quickly Waikato FC put together a piecemeal team to compete in the NZFC.\n\nThe NZFC itself went through a major restructure during this same period to keep Waikato FC and Team Wellington in competition.  To keep the costs down, the third round of the competition was culled.  This was good news for some clubs but not others, especially teams based in the [[Auckland]] region.  As a compensation for them an extended finals was introduced with each team playing home and away.\n\nWhile Waikato FC did not make the top four and qualify for the playoffs, it was in touch with the leaders throughout the season and had it been lucky enough to pick up a further four points would have qualified for the finals.\n\nIn December 2015 it was announced that they'd be passing their [[ASB Premiership]] licence on to [[Hamilton Wanderers]] effective 2016\u201317 season ending their existence in the top flight of New Zealand Football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzfootball.co.nz/new-trio-to-join-asb-premiership/|title=New trio to join ASB Premiership|work=New Zealand Football}}</ref>\n\nThey played their last match away to [[Auckland City FC]] on 28 February 2016 going down 4\u20131 to bring their existence to an end.\n\n==NZFC League Positions & Finals Results==\n{{update|section|date=March 2016}}\nA list of Waikato FC's League Placings as well as the [[NZFC]] League Champions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;\"\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; color:#ffffff; background-color:#006600;\" |\n|Year || Games || Won || Drawn || Lost || GF || GA || Points || Place || Champion\n|-\n|2004\u201305||21||9||4||8||27||25||31||3rd||[[Auckland City FC]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5fffa\"\n|2005\u201306||21||6||4||11||31||44||22||7th||[[Auckland City FC]]\n|-\n|2006\u201307||21||3||5||13||19||45||14||7th||[[Auckland City FC]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5fffa\"\n|2007\u201308||21||5||5||11||24||34||20||5th||[[Waitakere United]]\n|-\n|2008\u201309||14||6||1||7||19||22||19||6th||[[Auckland City FC]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5fffa\"\n|2009\u201310||14||3||1||10||19||33||10||8th||[[Waitakere United]]\n|-\n|2010\u201311||14||4||3||7||21||33||15||6th||[[Waitakere United]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5fffa\"\n|}\n\n*2004\u201305: Waikato FC played [[Waitakere United]] away in the Preliminary Final losing 4\u20131.

The club was founded in 2004 and  played in the [[ASB Premiership]]. WaiBOP United played their home fixtures at John Kerkhof Park, Cambridge.<ref>http://www.waibopfootball.co.nz/index.php?id=44&tx_ttnews[pointer]=7&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=605&tx_ttnews[backPid]=43&cHash=776584f631</ref>\n\nThe club was the regional representative for Waikato-Bay of Plenty Football, and also played home fixtures in [[Rotorua]] and [[Mount Maunganui]], both in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region. Between 2008 and 2010, Waikato FC was based at [[Centennial Park, Ngaruawahia|Centennial Park]] in [[Ngaruawahia]], having before that played at Waikato Stadium.\n\nFrom the 2014\u201315 season, the club changed its colours and kit to predominantly red and blue to better represent both Waikato and Bay of Plenty.<ref>{{cite web | title= Showing our colours | url = http://www.waibopunited.co.nz/showing-our-colours/ | accessdate = 10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWaikato's first season in existence was a moderately successful one. Playing in the inaugural season of the New Zealand Football Championship, they managed to finish in third place, after a poor start to the campaign.\n\nWaikato's first ever competitive game was away at [[YoungHeart Manawatu]], which they won convincingly 4\u20130 sending them straight to the top of table. Unfortunately they only won one of their next nine games, a run which saw them slide down to seventh in the eight-team league. In a dramatic change of fortunes, Waikato went on to win their next five games, including an away win over eventual champions [[Auckland City FC|Auckland City]]. They only lost two more games during the season and defied pre-season predictions by claiming third place and a spot in the playoffs' \"Elimination Final\" against [[Waitakere United]]. Waikato were crushed 4\u20131 by Waitakare at Trusts Stadium, [[Auckland]], ending their hopes of Championship victory but claiming overall third place was deemed a good achievement for a team that many expected to finish last.\n\nCraig Flowerday won Waikato's Player' Player of the Year award, and goalkeeper Mark Fulcher won Supporters' Player of the Year. David Samson won the Young Player of the Year Award. Striker Colin Gardyne won Sky Sports' Goal of the Season award, and was also Waikato FC's joint-top goalscorer along with Brett Derry.\n\nDespite finishing second bottom of the table, the team showed signs of promise, losing several fixtures by a single goal. Indeed, injuries to key personnel did little to dent the squad's resolve. The move to playing games outside [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], perhaps was not financially successful, as the gate numbers were not as large as expected, but [[Rotorua]] became a fortress with wins over both [[Hawke's Bay United|Hawke's Bay Utd]] and eventual champions [[Auckland City FC|Auckland City]].\n\nFor the start of Season Five the Waikato FC made some bold intentions by signing up [[Kevin Fallon]] to manage the club. From the outside everything at the club seemed fine, but internally the club was in financial strife. Just out from the start of the season the club came out and said that it could no longer afford to compete in the [[NZFC]]. This created a huge outcry amongst the football fraternity. To make the situation worse for the NZFC, [[Team Wellington]] also publicly announced that it too could no longer afford to take part in the competition.\n\nWith the prospect of no [[Waikato]]/[[Bay Of Plenty]] representation at national level, and also the fear that the NZFC would collapse, various people in the football community stepped in to help, some of the most notable being people such as [[Gordon Glen-Watson]] who had played top level football in New Zealand, and [[Wayne Bates]], a [[Ngaruawahia United|Ngaruawahia United AFC]] alumni.

The final mass concentration ''&rho;''(NaCl) is:\n: ''&rho;''(NaCl) = {{sfrac|11.6 g |11.6 g + 100 g}} = 0.104 g/g = 10.4 %\n\nThe density of such a solution is 1.07&nbsp;g/mL, thus its volume is:\n: ''V'' =  {{sfrac|11.6 g + 100 g |1.07 g/mL}} = 104.3 mL\n\nThe molar concentration of NaCl in the solution is therefore:\n:''c''(NaCl) = {{sfrac|11.6 g |58 g/mol}} / 104.3 mL = 0.00192 mol/mL = 1.92 mol/L\n\nHere, 58&nbsp;g/mol is the [[molar mass]] of NaCl.\n|2= A typical task in chemistry is the preparation of 100&nbsp;mL (= 0.1 L) of a 2&nbsp;mol/L solution of NaCl in water. The mass of salt needed is:\n:''m''(NaCl) = 2 mol/L \u00d7 0.1 L \u00d7 58 g/mol = 11.6 g\n\nTo create the solution, 11.6 g NaCl are placed in a [[volumetric flask]], dissolved in some water, then followed by the addition of more water until the total volume reaches 100&nbsp;mL.\n|3= The density of [[water]] is approximately 1000 g/L and its molar mass is 18.02 g/mol (or 1/18.02=0.055&nbsp;mol/g).  Therefore, the molar concentration of water is:\n:''c''(H<sub>2</sub>O) = {{sfrac|1000 g/L |18.02 g/mol}} \u2248 55.5 mol/L\n\nLikewise, the concentration of [[solid hydrogen]] (molar mass = 2.02 g/mol) is:\n:''c''(H<sub>2</sub>) = {{sfrac|88 g/L |2.02 g/mol}} = 43.7 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of pure [[osmium tetroxide]] (molar mass = 254.23 g/mol) is:\n:''c''(OsO<sub>4</sub>) = {{sfrac|5.1 kg/L |254.23 g/mol}} = 20.1 mol/L.\n|4= A typical protein in [[bacterium|bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', may have about 60 copies, and the volume of a bacterium is about <math>10^{-15}</math> L. Thus, the number concentration ''C'' is:\n:''C'' = 60 / (10<sup>\u221215</sup> L)= 6{{e|16}} L<sup>\u22121</sup>\n\nThe molar concentration is:\n:''c'' = ''{{sfrac |C |N<sub>A</sub>}}'' = {{sfrac|6{{e|16}} L<sup>\u22121</sup> |6{{e|23}} mol<sup>\u22121</sup>}} = 10<sup>\u22127</sup> mol/L = 100 nmol/L\n|5= [[Reference ranges for blood tests]], sorted by molar concentration:\n{{Wide image|Reference ranges for blood tests - by molarity.png|3000px|alt=}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Orders of magnitude (molar concentration)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/molar_solution_concentration_calculator.html Molar Solution Concentration Calculator]\n* [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/chm151L/vinegar.html Experiment to determine the molar concentration of vinegar by titration]\n{{Mole concepts}}\n{{Chemical solutions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Molar Concentration}}\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n", "name_user": "Taweetham", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"}
