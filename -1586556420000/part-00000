In 118 BC the central government of the Han dynasty ordered both the Commanderies (\u541b, ''j\u016bn'') and the Principalities (\u570b, ''gu\u00f3'') to cast Wu Zhu coins, these Wu Zhu coins are referred to as \"Jun Guo Wu Zhu\" (\u541b\u570b\u4e94\u9296 , ''j\u016bn gu\u00f3 w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') coins which at most have a diameter 33.3 millimetres and a weight of 5.8 grams. A notable feature of Jun Guo Wu Zhu coins is that they have a rim around the square center hole of the reverse side of them, these rims were added to prevent people from scrapping metal off the coins which would reduce their value. Another notable feature of these early Wu Zhu's is that they tend to have edges which are unfiled making these cash coins to generally have rough circumferences, they are notably also heavier than later cast Wu Zhu's.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://kongming.net/novel/coins/west_han_wuzhu/#credits|title= Ancient Chinese Coins: Western Han Wu Zhu.|date=2006|accessdate=1 September 2018|work= Content and photographs by Adrian Loder, archives hosted by James Peirce (Kongming's Archives).|language=en}}</ref> In 115 BC [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] decreed that all Wu Zhu cash coins should be cast with a value of 5 cash coins, these coins are known as \"Chi Ze Wu Zhu\" (\u8d64\u4ec4\u4e94\u9296, ''ch\u00ec z\u00e8 w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') or \"Zhong Guan Chi Ze\" (\u937e\u5b98\u8d64\u4ec4, ''zh\u014dng gu\u0101n ch\u00ec z\u00e8'') because of their \"red\" or \"purple\" edges as they were filed which resulted in the colour of the copper being visible, another feature of these cash coins is that the \"Wu\" (\u4e94) character tends to be composed of some rather straight lines.\n\nStarting from the year 113 BC the central government regained the exclusive authority to manufacture coinage, from this point Wu Zhu cash coins started being produced by the Three Offices of Shang Lin (\u4e0a\u6797\u4e09\u5b98, ''sh\u00e0ng l\u00edn s\u0101n gu\u0101n'').

Unlike the earlier coinage of the Xin dynasty which disastrously failed due to the extreme disparage between the nominal and [[intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]]s the coins of the Kingdom of Shu Han weren't as badly received due to the fact that the Wu Zhu cash coins produced by Dong Zhuo only weighed around a single gram, previously a cycle plagued Chinese governments trying to set of a fiat coinage system where first the government issued new (fiduciary) cash coins, then the government would set values, usually the people don\u2019t accept these set values, and then finally the currency doesn\u2019t trade which causes inflation to set in and counterfeiting becomes a prominent problem.

In the Southern dynasties it was customary for people to remove the middle part of Wu Zhu cash coins to create two separate coins, the portion cut out of the outer ring of the Wu Zhu is usually referred to as a \"thread ring Wu Zhu\" (\u7d96\u74b0\u4e94\u9296, ''xi\u00e0n hu\u00e1n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') while the coin cut out of the inner portion is usually referred to as \"chiseled rim Wu Zhu\" (\u947f\u908a\u4e94\u9296, ''z\u00e1o bi\u0101n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins or as \"cut rim Wu Zhu\" (\u526a\u8f2a\u4e94\u9296, ''ji\u01cen l\u00fan w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins. Private casting of cash coins also became a common practice during the Northern and Southern dynasties period which resulted in there being many extremely small, thin, and very fragile bronze cash coins that were cast by these private mints. These cash coins are known as \"goose eye\" (\u9d5d\u773c, ''\u00e9 y\u01cen'') or \"chicken eye\" (\u96de\u76ee, ''j\u012b m\u00f9'') coins.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.calgarycoin.com/reference/china/china3.htm|title= Chinese Cast Coins - A TIME OF DISUNITY.|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018|work= By Robert Kokotailo (Calgary Coin & Antique Gallery \u2013 Chinese Cast Coins).|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Liang dynasty ====\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] there were two types of Wu Zhu cash coins which were being manufactured, some had an outside while others did not have an outside rim with the Wu Zhu cash coins without an outside rim are referred to as \"Female coins\" (\u5973\u9322, ''n\u01da qi\u00e1n'').\n\nFrom the year 523 onwards the government of the Liang dynasty decided to cast iron Wu Zhu cash coins due to the fact that iron was both relatively easy and not expensive to acquire in what is today [[Sichuan]]. The iron cash coins issued by the Liang dynasty are quite distinctive from other iron cash coins as they have 4 lines that radiate outwards from each corner of the square center hole which is why they're referred to as \"four corner coins\" (\u56db\u51fa\u9322, ''s\u00ec ch\u016b qi\u00e1n''). As it became quite common for the people to cast iron cash coins privately based on these government issues it wasn't long before their quantities increased so drastically that it required cartloads of these iron Wu Zhu cash coins to pay for anything, even to this day these Wu Zhu's are quite common due to the widespread private production that plagued these iron issues. After them the Taiqing Fengle (\u592a\u6e05\u8c50\u6a02, \"Tai Qing Prosperous and Happy\")  cash coin was cast under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]], these cash coins were actually believed to be [[Chinese numismatic charm]]s until recently and were named after the Taiqing period (547-549).\n\nIn 552 under the reign of [[Emperor Yuan of Liang|Emperor Yuan]] the capital city was moved to the city of [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], the Jiangling Mint issued Wu Zhu cash coins which had two \"stars\" (a term used to refer to dots on cash coins) on the observe of the Wu Zhu, one \"star\" was situated above the square center hole and one below and for this reason are commonly known as \"Two Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u5169\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''li\u01ceng zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n''). These Wu Zhu's were nominally ten normal Wu Zhu's and are relatively rare today.\n\nFrom the year 557 under the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Liang|Emperor Jing]] had Wu Zhu cash coins produced that had one \"star\" above the square hole and one \"star\" below on both sides of these Wu Zhu's which is why they are known as \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u56db\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''s\u00ec zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') and had a nominal value of 20 normal Wu Zhu cash coins, but merely 10 days after their introduction they were trading at par with regular Wu Zhu's. Another variant of these \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" had the \"stars\" on the left and right sides of the square center hole. Today \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" are extremely rare with those that have the \"stars\" above and below the square center hole being the rarest.\n\nAnother variant of Liang dynasty era Wu Zhu's known as the \"Three Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u4e09\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''s\u0101n zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') were produced, however as no historical records mention them it is exactly unknown when they were produced, it is speculated by some Chinese numismatists and Gary Ashkenazy that they were only produced for five days in the year 557 immediately after the production of the \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" to circulate at a value of 10 normal Wu Zhu's and had three \"stars\" to differentiate them from the earlier \"Two Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" which had the same exaggerated nominal value. \"Three Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" have one \"star\" above and one \"star\" below the obverse square hole, while they have one \"star\" just to the left and touching the rim that surrounds the square center hole on the reverse side of the coin. These cash coins are extremely rare today due to their extremely short production period.\n\nNote that despite their high nominal values, \"Two Pillar\", \"Three Pillar\", and \"Four Pillar\" Wu Zhu cash coins usually weighed less than 2 or 3 grams, this disparity between their nominal and intrinsic values was a contributing factor to the decline of the economy of the Liang dynasty.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/>\n\n==== Chen dynasty ====\n[[File:S529 Chen Wendi (7180620619).jpg|thumb|right|A Chen dynasty era Wu Zhu (\u4e94\u9296) cash coin.]]\n\nThe [[Chen dynasty]] produced Wu Zhu cash coins which had a nominal value of 10 \"Goose Eye Wu Zhu's\" and/or \"Chicken Eye Wu Zhu's\" and were known as \"Tianjia Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u5929\u5609\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''ti\u0101n ji\u0101 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') because they were produced during the Tianjia period of [[Emperor Wen of Chen|Emperor Wen]], however as not a single specimen exists today it is unknown how these Tianjia era Wu Zhu's looked like. It is speculated that these Tianjia era Wu Zhu's would have been relatively big and had a rim around the square center hole on the observe side of the coin being overall similar to the [[Taihuo Liuzhu]] (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coins. Wu Zhu cash coins that fit this description historically have been believed to have been produced during the Tianjian era (502-519) in the [[Liang dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]]. As Wu Zhu cash coins also fitting this description have been dug up in [[Guanzhong]], [[Shaanxi]] it has been proposed that they might've been produced by the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Xuan of Chen|Emperor Xuan]] in 579 the Taihuo Liuzhu (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coins were cast which originally had a nominal value of 10 Wu Zhu's but due to the fact that this fact accepted by the populace its nominal value was decreased to be equal to the Wu Zhu. Taihuo Liuzhu cash coins considered to be the \"crown jewel\" of [[Northern and Southern dynasties coinage#Southern dynasty coinage|Southern dyansty coinage]] due to the quality of its [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]]. As the [[seal script]] version of the [[Hanzi]] character for \"six\" (\u516d, ''li\u00f9'') looked similar to a human being standing [[wikt:akimbo|akimbo]] which inspired the contemporary saying that this symbolised the general people standing in this position before the Emperor and exclaiming that the nominal value of the Taihuo Liuzhu was too high. An extremely rare version of this cash coin exists that only has the inscription Liu Zhu (\u516d\u9296, ''li\u00f9 zh\u016b''), this coin is in fact so rare that only a single specimen of it has ever been reported to exist.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/>\n\n==== Northern Wei dynasty ====\n[[File:S277 Wei Nord Yonganwuzhu (7157283864).jpg|thumb|left|A Yongan Wuzhu (\u6c38\u5b89\u4e94\u9296) cash coin issued by the Northern Wei dynasty.]]\n\nThe [[Northern Wei]] dynasty was a [[Xianbei]] ruled state under the [[Tuoba]] clan that adopted the administrative system of the [[Han Chinese]] and even established their capital city at [[Luoyang]], a city which had been the capital city of various preceding Chinese dynasties and mandated that his people adopt both [[Chinese fashion]] and [[Middle Chinese|language]]. During this period [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] ordered the issuance of the Taihe Wuzhu (\u592a\u548c\u4e94\u9296, ''t\u00e0i h\u00e9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') as part of this [[Sinicisation]] process. There is one purported version of the Taihe Wuzhu which has the Chinese character \"Tai\" (\u592a) written in a calligraphic style akin to that of the \"Tai\" on the Taihuo Liuzhu (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coin issued by the [[Chen dynasty]]. However, as the only evidence relating to the existence of this cash coin comes from rubbings in old coin catalogues it is speculated that or actually isn\u2019t real.\n\nThe Northern Wei dynasty started issuing regular Wu Zhu (\u4e94\u9296) cash coins in 510 but it is currently unknown what special characteristics these Wu Zhu cash coins had to differentiate them from other Wu Zhu's.\n\n[[Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaozhuang]] ordered the creation of the Yongan Wuzhu in the year 529 which was during the Yongan period (528-530), despite the fact that the authoritative power government of the Northern Wei dynasty was in trouble as the rebellion of the [[Six Frontier Towns]] waged on for a decade. After [[Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowu]] was forced to flee from Luoyang in the year 534 the country split into the [[Western Wei]] dynasty and the [[Eastern Wei]] dynasty, and despite the fact that neither country existed for a long period of time they both continued issuing Yongan Wuzhu cash coins to the point that both large quantities and a large number of varieties exist, as well as the fact that Yongan Wuzhu cash coins are still extremely common today.\n\nDuring this era various nicknames for cash coins were given by the people which include the \"Auspicious cash coins\" (\u5409\u9322, ''j\u00ed qi\u00e1n'') as well as the \"Heavenly Pillar\" (\u5929\u682a) cash coins, it is unknown what these cash coins were but it's speculated by Gary Ashkenazy that they were variants of the Yongan Wuzhu cash coins, according to Gary Ashkenazy the \"Auspicious cash coins\" were very likely to have been Yongan Wuzhu's that had the Hanzi character for \"[[earth]]\" (\u571f) on the reverse side of the coin above the square center hole. The nickname would then be derived from the fact that the square center hole resembles the Hanzi character \"{{linktext|\u53e3}}\" and as the \"\u571f\" would be above it they together would look like \"{{linktext|\u5409}}\" meaning \"auspicious\". According to Gary Ashkenazy the \"Heavenly Pillar\" cash coin may have also been a variety of the Yongan Wuzhu which has a \"dot\" (dots represent \"stars\" (\u661f) on Chinese cash coins) in the lower right part of the obverse side of the coin. When the \"Heavenly Pillar\" cash coin is held upright it would point towards the sky or \"heaven\" (\u5929).  The \"star\" in this particular case can also be referred to as a \"pillar\" (\u682a) because it is cylindrically shaped and appears to rise up from the surface (\u8089) of the Yongan Wuzhu cash coin. Another variant of the Yongan Wuzhu is also known as the \"four corner\" (si chu \u56db\u51fa) cash coin because it has 4 diagonal lines thar extend outwards from the corners of the square center hole all the way to the reverse rim of these Yongan Wuzhu coins.\n\nThere were other cash coins in this era which also had descriptive nicknames assigned to them such as \"Yongzhou Green-Red\" (\u96cd\u5dde\u9752\u8d64, ''y\u014dng zh\u014du q\u012bng ch\u00ec''), \"Liangzhou Born Thick\" (\u6881\u5dde\u751f\u539a, ''li\u00e1ng zh\u014du sh\u0113ng h\u00f2u''), \"Tight Cash\" (\u7dca\u9322, ''j\u01d0n qi\u00e1n''), and \"Red Halter\" (\u8d64\u727d, ''ch\u00ec qi\u0101n'').

Under this short-lived dynasty, many reforms were initiated that led to the subsequent success of the [[Tang dynasty]]. The only coin associated with the Sui is a Wu Zhu coin. [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that Wu Zhu cash coins be produced in the first year of the Kaihuang period (581 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), alongside the introduction of this new Wu Zhu cash coin the older currencies were gradually being deprecated and with the conquest of the [[Chen dynasty]] the coins now known as \"Sui Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u968b\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''su\u00ed w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') were the only circulating currency in all of China. The reason why Emperor Wen introduced a new Wu Zhu was because the fiduciary cash coins of the Northern Zhou and Chen dynasties placed the economy in a bad state and the Sui Wu Zhu's were set to the original weight of 2 grams. The first Wu Zhu's are known as the \"Kaihuang Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u958b\u7687\u4e94\u9296, ''k\u0101i hu\u00e1ng w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') because of their year of introduction, later Emperor Wen allowed the principalities of the Sui dynasty to cast their own Wu Zhu's.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/> Additional mints were set up in various prefectures, typically with five furnaces each. Cash was frequently checked for quality by the officials. However, after 605, private coining again caused a deterioration of the coinage.{{sfn|Hartill|2005|p=101}} Today these Wu Zhu cash coins are still very common and must have likely been manufactured in immense numbers. The fabric of the Wu Zhu's of the Sui dynasty is unlike that of any earlier Chinese cash coins but resemble that of the vast majority of later produced Chinese coins. The rims of these Wu Zhu's tend to be broad and flat, while earlier Chinese cash coins usually have thin and rather rounded rims. The basic fabric of a coin is dictated by the minting techniques used to produce it and the Wu Zhu's of the Sui dynasty were produced with an entirely new casting technology.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.calgarycoin.com/reference/china/china4.htm|title= Chinese Cast Coins - MEDIEVAL CHINESE COINS - THE SUI, T'ANG AND POST TANG DYNASTIES.|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018|work= By Robert Kokotailo (Calgary Coin & Antique Gallery \u2013 Chinese Cast Coins).|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAmong the varieties of the Sui dynasty era Wu Zhu is one which is particularly well-made composed of what the Chinese call \"white copper\" (\u767d\u9285, ''b\u00e1i t\u00f3ng'') and are therefore known as \"Bai Qian Wu Zhu\" (\u767d\u9322\u4e94\u9296, ''b\u00e1i qi\u00e1n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins and are believed to have been manufactured in the [[Jiangnan]] region.

Sometimes has a rimless reverse. Taken to be the earliest Wu Zhu. According to the History of Han, in 118 BC the Commanderies (''Jun'') and Principalities (''Guo'') were ordered to cast 5 ''zhu'' coins with a circular rim so that it would be impossible to clip them to glean a bit of copper. || \n|- \n| '''Chi Ze Wu Zhu ''' ({{zh | c=\u8d64\u4ec4\u4e94\u9296| hp=ch\u00ec z\u00e8 w\u01d4 zh\u016b| links=no}}) (115\u2013113 BC) is a lighter coin than the above, with filed edges. The Han records state that in 115 BC the mints in the capital were requested to cast ''Chi Ze'' coins, with one being worth five local coins. Only these were to circulate. ''Chi Ze'' means Red (or Shining) Edge, referring to the red copper showing when the edges were filed smooth. Some examples of this coin were found from the tomb of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan]], who died in 113 BC. || \n|- \n| '''Shang Lin San Guan Wu Zhu''' ({{zh | c=\u4e0a\u6797\u4e09\u5b98\u4e94\u9296| hp=sh\u00e0ng l\u00edn s\u0101n gu\u0101n w\u01d4 zh\u016b| links=no}}) (From 113 BC) refers to the Three Offices of Shang Lin Park which were the Office for Coinage, the Office for Sorting Copper, and the Office of Price Equalisation. Minting was now confined to the central authorities. These coins usually have a raised rim on the top of the hole on the obverse. Their quality was so high that forgery became unprofitable except to true artisans, great villains, or thieves. All earlier coins were to be melted down and the copper taken to Shang Lin. || [[File: Shang Lin San Guan Wu Zhu.jpg|75px]]\n|- \n| '''Wu Zhu Coins''' (AD 25). Even after the end of the Wang Mang regime (see below), the coinage system remained in disarray. Cloth, silk and grain were used as money along with coins. However, cash was the normal measure of wealth and was used in large quantities. When Yang Ping (92\u2013195) was in economic difficulties, he was offered a gift of one million cash. Wu Zhu coins continued to be issued, along with other coins, until the end of the sixth century. Some coins can be attributed to specific reigns or events; many can not. || \n|- \n| '''The Iron Wu Zhu''', resembling the W.

Head of the ''zhu'' component rounded. Typical of Eastern Han Wu Zhu's. In AD 30, a ditty was sung by the youths of Sichuan: \"The yellow bull! the white belly! Let Wu Zhu coins return\". This ridiculed the tokens of Wang Mang and the iron coins of Gongsun Shu, which were withdrawn by the Eastern Han [[Emperor Guangwu]] in the 16th year of Jian Wu (AD 40). The Emperor was advised that the foundation of the wealth of a country depends on a good political economy, which was found in the good old Wu Zhu coinage, and so reissued the Wu Zhu coins. || \n|- \n| '''The Si Chu Wu Zhu''' ({{zh | c=\u56db\u51fa\u4e94\u9296| hp=s\u00ec ch\u016b w\u01d4 zh\u016b| l=Four Corner five zhu| links=no}}) has four lines on reverse radiating from the corners of the hole. It is attributed to the Eastern Han [[Emperor Ling]], AD 186. The four lines are said to represent wealth flowing from a ruined city\u2014an omen of the overthrow of the Han Dynasty. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which displays a long, prominent horizontal line on the obverse right above the square center hole. The diameter of this particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be around 20.6 millimeters and their weight generally is around 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which is distinctive in that it has three (3) slanted lines above, and three (3) slanted lines below, the square center hole. The slanting lines are raised above the surface which means that they had to be a part of the coin mould at the time of their production. The three (3) lines above and the three (3) lines below resemble the symbols on the Western Han dynasty era [[Ban Liang]] cash coins. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tends to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There are several types of  Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins which have four lines (or possibly elongated dots) to the left of the square center hole on the reverse side of the cash coin. These ancient Chinese symbols are similar to those that appeared on the reverse sides of some Western Han dynasty era Ban Liang cash coins. These types of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 22.6 millimeters and a weight of 1.4 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has four (4- oblique lines extending outward from each corner of the square center hole to the rim on the reverse side of the cash coin. In [[Mandarin Chinese]], this technique is referred to as \"Si Chu\"  (\u56db\u51fa), \"Si\" (\u56db) translates as \"four\" and \"Chu\" (\u51fa) translates as \"going out\". This type of cash coin is also known as a \"corner coin\" (\u89d2\u94b1), and these \"corner coins\" are generally believed to have been manufactured in the year 186 AD during the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] of the Eastern Han dynasty. As cities in ancient China had walls built around them as a means of protection against outside attacks. It is often said that the square center hole of this coin represented the city and that the four lines going out represented wealth flowing out, portending the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in the year 220 AD. The diameter of this series of Wu Zhu cash coins tends to be around 25 millimeters and their weight tends to generally be around 3.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is another type of \"Si Chu\" (\u56db\u51fa) Wu Zhu cash coins or \"corner\" Wu Zhu cash coins with four lines radiating outward from the square center hole, this variant is made from iron.

This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 20.5 millimeters and a general weight of 2.6 grams. || \n|-\n| Some types of Wu Zhu cash coins contain Chinese characters and/or other ancient Chinese symbols. There is type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins with the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"Xiao\" (\u5c0f), which could be translated as \"small\", just above the square center hole, such characters as these may have indicated the area or limits in which these coins were intended to circulate to prevent them from circulating outside. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 24.3&nbsp;mm and their average weight is around 2.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins produced during the Eastern Han dynasty era that has the Chinese character \"Wang\" (\u738b) on the reverse side of the cash coin, rotated ninety (90) degrees, below the square center hole. \"Wang\" could be translated as \"king\" but it is also a common family name in China. In this instance the \"Wang\" Chinese character rises above the field of the cash coin which indicates that it was a designed into the coin mould. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 22.7 millimeters and an average weight of 2 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which have the Chinese character \"Gong\" (\u5de5) meaning \"work\" or \"industry\" written below the square center hole on the obverse side of the cash coin. The \"Gong\" character is \"in relief\" (\u9633\u6587) meaning it was engraved into the coin mould in the same way as the other Chinese characters used in its legend or inscription. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter which is around 23.7 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.3 grams. || \n|- \n| There is another type of Wu Zhu cash coins which also display a very distinct \"Gong\" (\u5de5) Chinese character meaning \"work\" or \"industry\", however this type tends to have the \"Gong\"on the reverse side of the cash coin below the lower left corner of the square center hole.

In China the swastika represents the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"Wan\" (\u4e07) which could be translated \"ten-thousand\".  The extended meaning of \"Wan\" would be \"all\" such as \"the myriad things\" as it was used to represent in classic [[Taoism|Taoist]] text written by [[Laozi]] the [[Tao Te Ching]] (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93).This type of Wu Zhu cash coins have diameters which is generally around 23.5 millimeters and their weight tends to generally be around 2.3 grams. || \n|- \n| '''Shu Wu Zhu''' ({{zh | c=\u8700\u4e94\u9296| hp=sh\u01d4 w\u01d4 zh\u016b| links=no}}) coins have the word ''Chuan'' ({{zh | c=\u5ddd| hp=chu\u0101n| links=no}}) on the obverse, or the numbers 1\u201332 on the reverse, in incuse characters.

The \"ten\" on these cash coins was engraved sometime after it was manufactured. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is generally around 25.9 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"ten\" (\u5341) on the reverse side of the cash coin protrudes above the surface of the cash coin and is located above the square center hole.

This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 24.5 millimeters and a weight of 2 grams. || \n|- \n| There are various types of Wu Zhu cash coins that incorporate [[counting rods]] which are also known as \"rod numbers\" (numerals), this ancient form of writing Chinese numbers that occasionally appear on old Chinese cash coins rod numerals are believed to have been mainly used for doing calculations.. Among the types of Wu Zhu cash coins with rod numerals is one specific type produced under the reign of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The distinctive feature of these cash coin is that there are four (4) vertical bars (or lines) incused below the square center hole. \"Incuse\" means that the lines were cut, engraved or punched into the Wu Zhu cash coin, it is currently still unclear why they sometimes appear on these very old Chinese coins. As seen in the Wu Zhu cash coins that display the Chinese numbers \"one\"  (\u4e00), \"two\" (\u4e8c) and \"three\" (\u4e09) consist of one, two and three lines, respectively,  one might guess through deduction that the number \"four\" would consist of four lines which is not the case with modern Chinese but it was the case in the ancient rod numeral system. For this reason it odd believed that the four lines on this type of Wu Zhu cash coins probably represent the number \"four\" in ancient Chinese rod numerals. The coins with one, two and three lines in actually may also be rod numerals since they are written empirically the same as the characters in modern Chinese. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally has a diameter of 24.5 millimeters and a weight of 2.1 gram. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coin which above the hole of has a short vertical line intersected by a longer horizontal line. This ancient Chinese symbol, which resembles a \"T\" turned on its side, appears to be the rod number \"six\" as written in the old Chinese rod numeral system. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 22.6 millimeters and tend to have a weight of 1.9 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins on which there appears to be the ancient Chinese rod numeral \"six\" below the square center hole the reverse side of the cash coin. The diameter of this series of Wu Zhu cash coins is generally around 23 millimeters and their weight averages out around 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which above the square center hole appear to have an ancient Chinese rod numeral, this ancient Chinese rod number appears to be protruding above the surface of the cash coin, it is a horizontal line with three (3) vertical lines underneath. This is the ancient Chinese rod numeral symbol for \"8\" (eight). The series of Wu Zhu cash coins is also unusual because of the two dots (which are meant to represent \"stars\" on ancient Chinese cash coins) inside the \"Wu\" (\u4e94) Chinese character to the right of the square center hole. There is one dot (or \"star\") in the upper half and one dot (or \"star\") in the lower half of the character. This symbol gives the appearance of two eyes staring at the observer. Which is why this Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coin variety with the \"two eyes\" is known as '''\"Chang Ming Wu Zhu\"''' (\u9577\u660e\u4e94\u94e2). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally has a diameter of 21 millimeters and a weight of 1.4 grams. ||\n|- \n| There is a series of Wu Zhu cash coins which has an ancient Chinese symbol above the square center hole which is very similar to a rod numeral. This symbol resembles the Chinese character \"Shang\" (\u4e0a), which means \"up\", except that the upper horizontal stroke is on the left instead of the right. Gary Ashkenazy speculates that it is an alternative way of writing \"six\" in ancient Chinese rod numerals or that it might stand for \"seven\". Gary Ashkenazy also proposes that it might not be a number at all. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and tend to have a weight of 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| Some types of Wu Zhu cash coins have what appear to be lines, among them is a very specific type which on its obverse side has a very prominent vertical line (\u7ad6) above, and another very prominent vertical line below the square center hole. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 22.5 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins which have  a long vertical line above and another below the square center hole on the reverse side. Since in this specific type of Wu Zhu cash coins the lines tend to be raised above the coin's surface, these lines had to have been intentionally included in the casting mould from which the cash coin was manufactured. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be 23 millimeters and their weight is generally around 2 grams. || \n|- \n| '''Tian Jian Wu Zhu''' has an inner rim on obverse. At the start of the [[Liang Dynasty]], money was only used around the capital. Elsewhere grain and cloth were used for trade. In the south, everyone used gold and silver. Therefore, in the 1st year of the Tian Jian period (502), the [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] cast Wu Zhu coins with an outer and inner rim.

This second \"Wu\" Chinese character is raised above the surface of the Wu Zhu cash coin the same as the Hanzi characters to the right and left of the hole. This means the second \"Wu\" Chinese character was actually intentionally engraved into the mould in the same manner as the other Chinese characters. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins tends to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and a weight of 2.2 grams. ||\n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coin has another \"Wu\" (\u4e94) Chinese character, meaning \"five\", located to the left of the square center hole on the reverse side of the Wu Zhu cash coin. Unlike the type mentioned above, this \"Wu\" character is actually incused.

Below the square center hole are two dots (which represent two \"stars\"). The dots (or \"stars\") and the \"ten\" Chinese character are in relief which means that they protrude above the coin surface and were part of the original design of the mould from which the Wu Zhu cash coins were cast.

This type of Wu Zhu cash coins has a diameter of 25.9 millimeters and a weight of 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the \"one\" (\u4e00) is located below the Chinese character \"Wu\" (\u4e94) to the right side of the square center hole. These Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 23.3 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has on its obverse side (far left) a prominent \"one\" (\u4e00) located below the character \"Wu\" (\u4e94). However, the most distinctive feature or characteristic of this Wu Zhu cash coin is the center hole which is not square in shape unlike the far majority of other Chinese cash coins. Most non-square center holes are actually the result of insufficient molten [[bronze]] flowing to certain parts of the coin mould.  The borders of the holes, in these cases, tend to be very ragged, irregular, and even uneven. This Han Dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coin is actually fairly well-made and has a \"number\" symbol meaning it received special attention during its casting process. The coin's unusual hole, while not square, is still too regular to have been formed by any form of accident. There are documented reports of similar Wu Zhu cash coins having been found with unusual center holes which appear to probably have been intentionally made. According to Gary Ashkenazy there is an article in the 1987 (seventh issue) of the Chinese periodical \"[[Shaanxi Finance]]\" (\u965d\u897f\u91d1\u878d, ''sh\u01cen x\u012b j\u012bn r\u00f3ng'') which shows rubbings of several wu zhu coins with unusual holes found in a hoard. One Wu Zhu cash coin is indeed very similar to this specific type but has only one, in contrast to two, square-like projections extending beyond the normal border of the center hole. The article also showed illustrations of several cash coins which had triangular-shaped projections extending beyond the border of the inner hole. According to Gary Ashkenazy the author of the article says that the coins did not show any indication that the holes were modified by force in any manner at some time after their casting. The author of the article was unable to propose what these distinctive holes may mean or symbolise as these things remain unknown. These Wu Zhu coins, with their modified square holes, may very well have been the precursor of the [[Cash (Chinese coin)#Cash coins with flower (rosette) holes|Chinese cash coins with \"flower\" or \"rosette\" holes]] (\u82b1\u7a7f\u9322) which were to become fairly common by the time of the Song Dynasty (960-1279). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins has a diameter of 26.2 millimeters and a weight of 2.5 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that also has the Chinese character (\u4e00) meaning \"one\". But unlike the earlier types the \"one\" is above the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) Chinese character at the left of the side of the Square center hole. These Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 26.2 millimeters and a weight of 2.4 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the character \"one\" (\u4e00) is below the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character at the left side  of the square center hole. The diameter of this particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be around 25.8 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins which has two long horizontal lines above the square center hole which may or may not represent the Chinese character (Hanzi) for \"two\" (\u4e8c). The diameter of these Wu Zhu cash coins is 23.9 millimeters and their weight is 2.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which has two short horizontal lines above the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character at the left of the square center hole. These two parallel lines represent the Chinese character (Hanzi) for \"two\" (\u4e8c). These Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 23.3 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zu cash coins that was cast during the \"Six Dynasties period\" in Chinese history, during this time  some very refined cash coins were cast, however most cash coins from this period can be described as rather crude and inferior. Among these types of cash coin is an Wu Zhu can coin where the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character to the left of the square center hole has been simplified so that only its right side component of \"Zhu\" (\u6731) appears. What is further unusual about this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is that there are two vertical bars incused just above the hole which according to Gary Ashkenazy probably represent the Chinese character for \"two\" (\u4e8c). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 22.3 millimeters and a weight of 2.5 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins that have a short vertical line or bar above the square center hole. This symbol may or may not represent the Chinese number \"one\" (\u4e00) as the purpose of these marks has yet to be revealed by modern archeologists. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter is 25.65 millimeters and a weight of 2.6 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins that on their obverse side have two vertical lines in relief (known as \"\u9633\u6587\" in Mandarin Chinese) above the square center hole.

Among them is yet another type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins. This particular type has one horizontal line, which represents the Hanzi character for \"one\" (\u4e00), below the square center hole. This short line which represents the number \"one\" was neither cut or engraved into the Wu Zhu cash coin.

A notable feature of Jun Guo Wu Zhu coins is that they have a rim around the square center hole of the reverse side of them, these rims were added to prevent people from scrapping metal off the coins which would reduce their value.

In the Southern dynasties it was customary for people to remove the middle part of Wu Zhu cash coins to create two separate coins, the portion cut out of the outer ring of the Wu Zhu is usually referred to as a \"thread ring Wu Zhu\" (\u7d96\u74b0\u4e94\u9296, ''xi\u00e0n hu\u00e1n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') while the coin cut out of the inner portion is usually referred to as \"chiseled rim Wu Zhu\" (\u947f\u908a\u4e94\u9296, ''z\u00e1o bi\u0101n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins or as \"cut rim Wu Zhu\" (\u526a\u8f2a\u4e94\u9296, ''ji\u01cen l\u00fan w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins. Private casting of cash coins also became a common practice during the Northern and Southern dynasties period which resulted in there being many extremely small, thin, and very fragile bronze cash coins that were cast by these private mints. These cash coins are known as \"goose eye\" (\u9d5d\u773c, ''\u00e9 y\u01cen'') or \"chicken eye\" (\u96de\u76ee, ''j\u012b m\u00f9'') coins.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.calgarycoin.com/reference/china/china3.htm|title= Chinese Cast Coins - A TIME OF DISUNITY.|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018|work= By Robert Kokotailo (Calgary Coin & Antique Gallery \u2013 Chinese Cast Coins).|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Liang dynasty ====\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] there were two types of Wu Zhu cash coins which were being manufactured, some had an outside while others did not have an outside rim with the Wu Zhu cash coins without an outside rim are referred to as \"Female coins\" (\u5973\u9322, ''n\u01da qi\u00e1n'').\n\nFrom the year 523 onwards the government of the Liang dynasty decided to cast iron Wu Zhu cash coins due to the fact that iron was both relatively easy and not expensive to acquire in what is today [[Sichuan]]. The iron cash coins issued by the Liang dynasty are quite distinctive from other iron cash coins as they have 4 lines that radiate outwards from each corner of the square center hole which is why they're referred to as \"four corner coins\" (\u56db\u51fa\u9322, ''s\u00ec ch\u016b qi\u00e1n''). As it became quite common for the people to cast iron cash coins privately based on these government issues it wasn't long before their quantities increased so drastically that it required cartloads of these iron Wu Zhu cash coins to pay for anything, even to this day these Wu Zhu's are quite common due to the widespread private production that plagued these iron issues. After them the Taiqing Fengle (\u592a\u6e05\u8c50\u6a02, \"Tai Qing Prosperous and Happy\")  cash coin was cast under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]], these cash coins were actually believed to be [[Chinese numismatic charm]]s until recently and were named after the Taiqing period (547-549). \n\nIn 552 under the reign of [[Emperor Yuan of Liang|Emperor Yuan]] the capital city was moved to the city of [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], the Jiangling Mint issued Wu Zhu cash coins which had two \"stars\" (a term used to refer to dots on cash coins) on the observe of the Wu Zhu, one \"star\" was situated above the square center hole and one below and for this reason are commonly known as \"Two Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u5169\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''li\u01ceng zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n''). These Wu Zhu's were nominally ten normal Wu Zhu's and are relatively rare today. \n\nFrom the year 557 under the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Liang|Emperor Jing]] had Wu Zhu cash coins produced that had one \"star\" above the square hole and one \"star\" below on both sides of these Wu Zhu's which is why they are known as \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u56db\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''s\u00ec zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') and had a nominal value of 20 normal Wu Zhu cash coins, but merely 10 days after their introduction they were trading at par with regular Wu Zhu's. Another variant of these \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" had the \"stars\" on the left and right sides of the square center hole. Today \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" are extremely rare with those that have the \"stars\" above and below the square center hole being the rarest. \n\nAnother variant of Liang dynasty era Wu Zhu's known as the \"Three Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u4e09\u67f1\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''s\u0101n zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') were produced, however as no historical records mention them it is exactly unknown when they were produced, it is speculated by some Chinese numismatists and Gary Ashkenazy that they were only produced for five days in the year 557 immediately after the production of the \"Four Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" to circulate at a value of 10 normal Wu Zhu's and had three \"stars\" to differentiate them from the earlier \"Two Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" which had the same exaggerated nominal value. \"Three Pillar Wu Zhu cash coins\" have one \"star\" above and one \"star\" below the obverse square hole, while they have one \"star\" just to the left and touching the rim that surrounds the square center hole on the reverse side of the coin. These cash coins are extremely rare today due to their extremely short production period.\n\nNote that despite their high nominal values, \"Two Pillar\", \"Three Pillar\", and \"Four Pillar\" Wu Zhu cash coins usually weighed less than 2 or 3 grams, this disparity between their nominal and intrinsic values was a contributing factor to the decline of the economy of the Liang dynasty.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/>\n\n==== Chen dynasty ====\n[[File:S529 Chen Wendi (7180620619).jpg|thumb|right|A Chen dynasty era Wu Zhu (\u4e94\u9296) cash coin.]]\n\nThe [[Chen dynasty]] produced Wu Zhu cash coins which had a nominal value of 10 \"Goose Eye Wu Zhu's\" and/or \"Chicken Eye Wu Zhu's\" and were known as \"Tianjia Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u5929\u5609\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''ti\u0101n ji\u0101 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') because they were produced during the Tianjia period of [[Emperor Wen of Chen|Emperor Wen]], however as not a single specimen exists today it is unknown how these Tianjia era Wu Zhu's looked like. It is speculated that these Tianjia era Wu Zhu's would have been relatively big and had a rim around the square center hole on the observe side of the coin being overall similar to the [[Taihuo Liuzhu]] (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coins. Wu Zhu cash coins that fit this description historically have been believed to have been produced during the Tianjian era (502-519) in the [[Liang dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]]. As Wu Zhu cash coins also fitting this description have been dug up in [[Guanzhong]], [[Shaanxi]] it has been proposed that they might've been produced by the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Xuan of Chen|Emperor Xuan]] in 579 the Taihuo Liuzhu (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coins were cast which originally had a nominal value of 10 Wu Zhu's but due to the fact that this fact accepted by the populace its nominal value was decreased to be equal to the Wu Zhu. Taihuo Liuzhu cash coins considered to be the \"crown jewel\" of [[Northern and Southern dynasties coinage#Southern dynasty coinage|Southern dyansty coinage]] due to the quality of its [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]]. As the [[seal script]] version of the [[Hanzi]] character for \"six\" (\u516d, ''li\u00f9'') looked similar to a human being standing [[wikt:akimbo|akimbo]] which inspired the contemporary saying that this symbolised the general people standing in this position before the Emperor and exclaiming that the nominal value of the Taihuo Liuzhu was too high. An extremely rare version of this cash coin exists that only has the inscription Liu Zhu (\u516d\u9296, ''li\u00f9 zh\u016b''), this coin is in fact so rare that only a single specimen of it has ever been reported to exist.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/>\n\n==== Northern Wei dynasty ====\n[[File:S277 Wei Nord Yonganwuzhu (7157283864).jpg|thumb|left|A Yongan Wuzhu (\u6c38\u5b89\u4e94\u9296) cash coin issued by the Northern Wei dynasty.]]\n\nThe [[Northern Wei]] dynasty was a [[Xianbei]] ruled state under the [[Tuoba]] clan that adopted the administrative system of the [[Han Chinese]] and even established their capital city at [[Luoyang]], a city which had been the capital city of various preceding Chinese dynasties and mandated that his people adopt both [[Chinese fashion]] and [[Middle Chinese|language]]. During this period [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] ordered the issuance of the Taihe Wuzhu (\u592a\u548c\u4e94\u9296, ''t\u00e0i h\u00e9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') as part of this [[Sinicisation]] process. There is one purported version of the Taihe Wuzhu which has the Chinese character \"Tai\" (\u592a) written in a calligraphic style akin to that of the \"Tai\" on the Taihuo Liuzhu (\u592a\u8ca8\u516d\u9296, ''t\u00e0i hu\u00f2 li\u00f9 zh\u016b'') cash coin issued by the [[Chen dynasty]]. However, as the only evidence relating to the existence of this cash coin comes from rubbings in old coin catalogues it is speculated that or actually isn\u2019t real.\n\nThe Northern Wei dynasty started issuing regular Wu Zhu (\u4e94\u9296) cash coins in 510 but it is currently unknown what special characteristics these Wu Zhu cash coins had to differentiate them from other Wu Zhu's.\n\n[[Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaozhuang]] ordered the creation of the Yongan Wuzhu in the year 529 which was during the Yongan period (528-530), despite the fact that the authoritative power government of the Northern Wei dynasty was in trouble as the rebellion of the [[Six Frontier Towns]] waged on for a decade. After [[Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowu]] was forced to flee from Luoyang in the year 534 the country split into the [[Western Wei]] dynasty and the [[Eastern Wei]] dynasty, and despite the fact that neither country existed for a long period of time they both continued issuing Yongan Wuzhu cash coins to the point that both large quantities and a large number of varieties exist, as well as the fact that Yongan Wuzhu cash coins are still extremely common today.\n\nDuring this era various nicknames for cash coins were given by the people which include the \"Auspicious cash coins\" (\u5409\u9322, ''j\u00ed qi\u00e1n'') as well as the \"Heavenly Pillar\" (\u5929\u682a) cash coins, it is unknown what these cash coins were but it's speculated by Gary Ashkenazy that they were variants of the Yongan Wuzhu cash coins, according to Gary Ashkenazy the \"Auspicious cash coins\" were very likely to have been Yongan Wuzhu's that had the Hanzi character for \"[[earth]]\" (\u571f) on the reverse side of the coin above the square center hole. The nickname would then be derived from the fact that the square center hole resembles the Hanzi character \"{{linktext|\u53e3}}\" and as the \"\u571f\" would be above it they together would look like \"{{linktext|\u5409}}\" meaning \"auspicious\". According to Gary Ashkenazy the \"Heavenly Pillar\" cash coin may have also been a variety of the Yongan Wuzhu which has a \"dot\" (dots represent \"stars\" (\u661f) on Chinese cash coins) in the lower right part of the obverse side of the coin. When the \"Heavenly Pillar\" cash coin is held upright it would point towards the sky or \"heaven\" (\u5929).  The \"star\" in this particular case can also be referred to as a \"pillar\" (\u682a) because it is cylindrically shaped and appears to rise up from the surface (\u8089) of the Yongan Wuzhu cash coin. Another variant of the Yongan Wuzhu is also known as the \"four corner\" (si chu \u56db\u51fa) cash coin because it has 4 diagonal lines thar extend outwards from the corners of the square center hole all the way to the reverse rim of these Yongan Wuzhu coins.\n\nThere were other cash coins in this era which also had descriptive nicknames assigned to them such as \"Yongzhou Green-Red\" (\u96cd\u5dde\u9752\u8d64, ''y\u014dng zh\u014du q\u012bng ch\u00ec''), \"Liangzhou Born Thick\" (\u6881\u5dde\u751f\u539a, ''li\u00e1ng zh\u014du sh\u0113ng h\u00f2u''), \"Tight Cash\" (\u7dca\u9322, ''j\u01d0n qi\u00e1n''), and \"Red Halter\" (\u8d64\u727d, ''ch\u00ec qi\u0101n'').

Under this short-lived dynasty, many reforms were initiated that led to the subsequent success of the [[Tang dynasty]]. The only coin associated with the Sui is a Wu Zhu coin. [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that Wu Zhu cash coins be produced in the first year of the Kaihuang period (581 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), alongside the introduction of this new Wu Zhu cash coin the older currencies were gradually being deprecated and with the conquest of the [[Chen dynasty]] the coins now known as \"Sui Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u968b\u4e94\u9296\u9322, ''su\u00ed w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n'') were the only circulating currency in all of China. The reason why Emperor Wen introduced a new Wu Zhu was because the fiduciary cash coins of the Northern Zhou and Chen dynasties placed the economy in a bad state and the Sui Wu Zhu's were set to the original weight of 2 grams. The first Wu Zhu's are known as the \"Kaihuang Wu Zhu cash coins\" (\u958b\u7687\u4e94\u9296, ''k\u0101i hu\u00e1ng w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') because of their year of introduction, later Emperor Wen allowed the principalities of the Sui dynasty to cast their own Wu Zhu's.<ref name=\"primaltrek\"/> Additional mints were set up in various prefectures, typically with five furnaces each. Cash was frequently checked for quality by the officials. However, after 605, private coining again caused a deterioration of the coinage.{{sfn|Hartill|2005|p=101}} Today these Wu Zhu cash coins are still very common and must have likely been manufactured in immense numbers. The fabric of the Wu Zhu's of the Sui dynasty is unlike that of any earlier Chinese cash coins but resemble that of the vast majority of later produced Chinese coins. The rims of these Wu Zhu's tend to be broad and flat, while earlier Chinese cash coins usually have thin and rather rounded rims. The basic fabric of a coin is dictated by the minting techniques used to produce it and the Wu Zhu's of the Sui dynasty were produced with an entirely new casting technology.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.calgarycoin.com/reference/china/china4.htm|title= Chinese Cast Coins - MEDIEVAL CHINESE COINS - THE SUI, T'ANG AND POST TANG DYNASTIES.|date=2018|accessdate=22 August 2018|work= By Robert Kokotailo (Calgary Coin & Antique Gallery \u2013 Chinese Cast Coins).|language=en}}</ref> \n\nAmong the varieties of the Sui dynasty era Wu Zhu is one which is particularly well-made composed of what the Chinese call \"white copper\" (\u767d\u9285, ''b\u00e1i t\u00f3ng'') and are therefore known as \"Bai Qian Wu Zhu\" (\u767d\u9322\u4e94\u9296, ''b\u00e1i qi\u00e1n w\u01d4 zh\u016b'') cash coins and are believed to have been manufactured in the [[Jiangnan]] region.

Even after the end of the Wang Mang regime (see below), the coinage system remained in disarray. Cloth, silk and grain were used as money along with coins.

The diameter of this particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be around 20.6 millimeters and their weight generally is around 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which is distinctive in that it has three (3) slanted lines above, and three (3) slanted lines below, the square center hole. The slanting lines are raised above the surface which means that they had to be a part of the coin mould at the time of their production. The three (3) lines above and the three (3) lines below resemble the symbols on the Western Han dynasty era [[Ban Liang]] cash coins. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tends to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There are several types of  Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins which have four lines (or possibly elongated dots) to the left of the square center hole on the reverse side of the cash coin. These ancient Chinese symbols are similar to those that appeared on the reverse sides of some Western Han dynasty era Ban Liang cash coins. These types of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 22.6 millimeters and a weight of 1.4 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has four (4- oblique lines extending outward from each corner of the square center hole to the rim on the reverse side of the cash coin. In [[Mandarin Chinese]], this technique is referred to as \"Si Chu\"  (\u56db\u51fa), \"Si\" (\u56db) translates as \"four\" and \"Chu\" (\u51fa) translates as \"going out\". This type of cash coin is also known as a \"corner coin\" (\u89d2\u94b1), and these \"corner coins\" are generally believed to have been manufactured in the year 186 AD during the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] of the Eastern Han dynasty. As cities in ancient China had walls built around them as a means of protection against outside attacks. It is often said that the square center hole of this coin represented the city and that the four lines going out represented wealth flowing out, portending the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in the year 220 AD. The diameter of this series of Wu Zhu cash coins tends to be around 25 millimeters and their weight tends to generally be around 3.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is another type of \"Si Chu\" (\u56db\u51fa) Wu Zhu cash coins or \"corner\" Wu Zhu cash coins with four lines radiating outward from the square center hole, this variant is made from iron. This specific type was made in the year 523 AD during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] (a country which existed from the year 502 AD until the year 557 AD). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 20.5 millimeters and a general weight of 2.6 grams. || \n|-\n| Some types of Wu Zhu cash coins contain Chinese characters and/or other ancient Chinese symbols. There is type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins with the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"Xiao\" (\u5c0f), which could be translated as \"small\", just above the square center hole, such characters as these may have indicated the area or limits in which these coins were intended to circulate to prevent them from circulating outside. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 24.3 mm and their average weight is around 2.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins produced during the Eastern Han dynasty era that has the Chinese character \"Wang\" (\u738b) on the reverse side of the cash coin, rotated ninety (90) degrees, below the square center hole. \"Wang\" could be translated as \"king\" but it is also a common family name in China. In this instance the \"Wang\" Chinese character rises above the field of the cash coin which indicates that it was a designed into the coin mould. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 22.7 millimeters and an average weight of 2 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which have the Chinese character \"Gong\" (\u5de5) meaning \"work\" or \"industry\" written below the square center hole on the obverse side of the cash coin. The \"Gong\" character is \"in relief\" (\u9633\u6587) meaning it was engraved into the coin mould in the same way as the other Chinese characters used in its legend or inscription. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter which is around 23.7 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.3 grams. || \n|- \n| There is another type of Wu Zhu cash coins which also display a very distinct \"Gong\" (\u5de5) Chinese character meaning \"work\" or \"industry\", however this type tends to have the \"Gong\"on the reverse side of the cash coin below the lower left corner of the square center hole. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally is around 26 millimeters and their weight is generally around 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which display ancient Chinese auspicious symbols, both above and below the square hole are [[swastika]]s. In China the swastika represents the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"Wan\" (\u4e07) which could be translated \"ten-thousand\".  The extended meaning of \"Wan\" would be \"all\" such as \"the myriad things\" as it was used to represent in classic [[Taoism|Taoist]] text written by [[Laozi]] the [[Tao Te Ching]] (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93).This type of Wu Zhu cash coins have diameters which is generally around 23.5 millimeters and their weight tends to generally be around 2.3 grams. || \n|- \n| '''Shu Wu Zhu''' ({{zh | c=\u8700\u4e94\u9296| hp=sh\u01d4 w\u01d4 zh\u016b| links=no}}) coins have the word ''Chuan'' ({{zh | c=\u5ddd| hp=chu\u0101n| links=no}}) on the obverse, or the numbers 1\u201332 on the reverse, in incuse characters.

They are attributed to [[Emperor Wen of Liu Song|Emperor Wen]] of the Southern Dynasties [[Liu Song|Song Dynasty]], who had them cast in 447 as a measure against coining malpractices. || \n|-\n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins with the character for \"ten\" (\u5341) incused above the square center hole on the obverse side of the cash coin. The \"ten\" on these cash coins was engraved sometime after it was manufactured. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is generally around 25.9 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"ten\" (\u5341) on the reverse side of the cash coin protrudes above the surface of the cash coin and is located above the square center hole. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 22 millimeters and tend to have a weight of 1.4 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a series of Wu Zhu cash coins which has the Hanzi (Chinese) character for \"ten\" (\u5341) on its reversed side where is incused above the square hole. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 24.5 millimeters and a weight of 2 grams. || \n|- \n| There are various types of Wu Zhu cash coins that incorporate [[counting rods]] which are also known as \"rod numbers\" (numerals), this ancient form of writing Chinese numbers that occasionally appear on old Chinese cash coins rod numerals are believed to have been mainly used for doing calculations.. Among the types of Wu Zhu cash coins with rod numerals is one specific type produced under the reign of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The distinctive feature of these cash coin is that there are four (4) vertical bars (or lines) incused below the square center hole. \"Incuse\" means that the lines were cut, engraved or punched into the Wu Zhu cash coin, it is currently still unclear why they sometimes appear on these very old Chinese coins. As seen in the Wu Zhu cash coins that display the Chinese numbers \"one\"  (\u4e00), \"two\" (\u4e8c) and \"three\" (\u4e09) consist of one, two and three lines, respectively,  one might guess through deduction that the number \"four\" would consist of four lines which is not the case with modern Chinese but it was the case in the ancient rod numeral system. For this reason it odd believed that the four lines on this type of Wu Zhu cash coins probably represent the number \"four\" in ancient Chinese rod numerals. The coins with one, two and three lines in actually may also be rod numerals since they are written empirically the same as the characters in modern Chinese. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally has a diameter of 24.5 millimeters and a weight of 2.1 gram. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coin which above the hole of has a short vertical line intersected by a longer horizontal line. This ancient Chinese symbol, which resembles a \"T\" turned on its side, appears to be the rod number \"six\" as written in the old Chinese rod numeral system. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 22.6 millimeters and tend to have a weight of 1.9 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins on which there appears to be the ancient Chinese rod numeral \"six\" below the square center hole the reverse side of the cash coin. The diameter of this series of Wu Zhu cash coins is generally around 23 millimeters and their weight averages out around 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which above the square center hole appear to have an ancient Chinese rod numeral, this ancient Chinese rod number appears to be protruding above the surface of the cash coin, it is a horizontal line with three (3) vertical lines underneath. This is the ancient Chinese rod numeral symbol for \"8\" (eight). The series of Wu Zhu cash coins is also unusual because of the two dots (which are meant to represent \"stars\" on ancient Chinese cash coins) inside the \"Wu\" (\u4e94) Chinese character to the right of the square center hole. There is one dot (or \"star\") in the upper half and one dot (or \"star\") in the lower half of the character. This symbol gives the appearance of two eyes staring at the observer. Which is why this Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coin variety with the \"two eyes\" is known as '''\"Chang Ming Wu Zhu\"''' (\u9577\u660e\u4e94\u94e2). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally has a diameter of 21 millimeters and a weight of 1.4 grams. ||\n|- \n| There is a series of Wu Zhu cash coins which has an ancient Chinese symbol above the square center hole which is very similar to a rod numeral. This symbol resembles the Chinese character \"Shang\" (\u4e0a), which means \"up\", except that the upper horizontal stroke is on the left instead of the right. Gary Ashkenazy speculates that it is an alternative way of writing \"six\" in ancient Chinese rod numerals or that it might stand for \"seven\". Gary Ashkenazy also proposes that it might not be a number at all. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally tend to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and tend to have a weight of 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| Some types of Wu Zhu cash coins have what appear to be lines, among them is a very specific type which on its obverse side has a very prominent vertical line (\u7ad6) above, and another very prominent vertical line below the square center hole. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 22.5 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins which have  a long vertical line above and another below the square center hole on the reverse side. Since in this specific type of Wu Zhu cash coins the lines tend to be raised above the coin's surface, these lines had to have been intentionally included in the casting mould from which the cash coin was manufactured. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be 23 millimeters and their weight is generally around 2 grams. || \n|- \n| '''Tian Jian Wu Zhu''' has an inner rim on obverse. At the start of the [[Liang Dynasty]], money was only used around the capital. Elsewhere grain and cloth were used for trade. In the south, everyone used gold and silver. Therefore, in the 1st year of the Tian Jian period (502), the [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] cast Wu Zhu coins with an outer and inner rim. He also cast another sort without a rim called the female coin. The two sorts circulated together. || \n|- \n| '''Nu Qian''' ({{zh | c=\u5973\u9322| hp=n\u01da qi\u00e1n| l=The Female Coin| links=no}}) have no outer rim. || \n|- \n| '''An iron Wu Zhu''' with four lines radiating from the corners of the hole on the reverse.

The two lines allegedly represent the number \"two\" in Chinese (\u4e8c). These Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and a weight of 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Han dynasty era Wu Zhu that has three vertical lines above the square center hole. These three lines allegedly represent the Chinese number \"three\" (\u4e09). These Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter that is 25.3 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that are similar to the type described above except that there are three slanting lines located below the square center hole. The three lines allegedly also represent the Chinese character for \"three\" (\u4e09).

This second \"Wu\" Chinese character is raised above the surface of the Wu Zhu cash coin the same as the Hanzi characters to the right and left of the hole. This means the second \"Wu\" Chinese character was actually intentionally engraved into the mould in the same manner as the other Chinese characters. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins tends to have a diameter of 23 millimeters and a weight of 2.2 grams. ||\n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coin has another \"Wu\" (\u4e94) Chinese character, meaning \"five\", located to the left of the square center hole on the reverse side of the Wu Zhu cash coin. Unlike the type mentioned above, this \"Wu\" character is actually incused. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins has a diameter of 24 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that have the Hanzi character \"Liu\" (\u516d), which means \"six\", incused at the right of the square center hole and is rotated ninety (90) degrees in the clockwise direction. The incused character was engraved into the coin after it had already been manufactured and was not a feature of the mould itself from which the Wu Zhu cash coin was produced. The diameter of these types of Wu Zhu cash coins 23.5 millimeters and their weight is usually 1.6 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has the Hanzi (Chinese) character \"Ba\" (\u516b), which means \"eight\" on the reverse side of the cash coin, incused above the square center hole. The \"Ba\" in this is usually upside down. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins generally have a diameter of 22.2 millimeters and a weight of 1.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has the number \"nine\" (\u4e5d) incused (or carved) right above the square center hole. There is usually also an incused line running vertically through the \"Wu\" (\u4e94) Chinese character on the right side of this type of Wu Zhu's. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is 26.2 millimeters and their weight generally is at 3 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Eastern Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins that has a rather large and unusually well made Hanzi (Chinese) character \"ten\" (\u5341) below the square center hole. The diameter of this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is generally around 23 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.6 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a rather unusual type of Wu Zhu cash coins which have the Hanzi (Chinese) character for \"ten\" (\u5341) above the square center hole. Below the square center hole are two dots (which represent two \"stars\"). The dots (or \"stars\") and the \"ten\" Chinese character are in relief which means that they protrude above the coin surface and were part of the original design of the mould from which the Wu Zhu cash coins were cast. This type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 24.5 millimeters and a weight which is generally around 2.9 grams. || \n|- \n| '''Liang Zhu Wu Zhu''' ({{zh | c=\u5169\u67f1\u4e94\u9296| hp=li\u01ceng zh\u00f9 w\u01d4 zh\u016b| l=Two Pillar| links=no}}) has a dot above and below the hole on the obverse.

This type of Wu Zhu cash coins has a diameter of 25.9 millimeters and a weight of 2.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the \"one\" (\u4e00) is located below the Chinese character \"Wu\" (\u4e94) to the right side of the square center hole. These Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 23.3 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that has on its obverse side (far left) a prominent \"one\" (\u4e00) located below the character \"Wu\" (\u4e94). However, the most distinctive feature or characteristic of this Wu Zhu cash coin is the center hole which is not square in shape unlike the far majority of other Chinese cash coins. Most non-square center holes are actually the result of insufficient molten [[bronze]] flowing to certain parts of the coin mould.  The borders of the holes, in these cases, tend to be very ragged, irregular, and even uneven. This Han Dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coin is actually fairly well-made and has a \"number\" symbol meaning it received special attention during its casting process. The coin's unusual hole, while not square, is still too regular to have been formed by any form of accident. There are documented reports of similar Wu Zhu cash coins having been found with unusual center holes which appear to probably have been intentionally made. According to Gary Ashkenazy there is an article in the 1987 (seventh issue) of the Chinese periodical \"[[Shaanxi Finance]]\" (\u965d\u897f\u91d1\u878d, ''sh\u01cen x\u012b j\u012bn r\u00f3ng'') which shows rubbings of several wu zhu coins with unusual holes found in a hoard. One Wu Zhu cash coin is indeed very similar to this specific type but has only one, in contrast to two, square-like projections extending beyond the normal border of the center hole. The article also showed illustrations of several cash coins which had triangular-shaped projections extending beyond the border of the inner hole. According to Gary Ashkenazy the author of the article says that the coins did not show any indication that the holes were modified by force in any manner at some time after their casting. The author of the article was unable to propose what these distinctive holes may mean or symbolise as these things remain unknown. These Wu Zhu coins, with their modified square holes, may very well have been the precursor of the [[Cash (Chinese coin)#Cash coins with flower (rosette) holes|Chinese cash coins with \"flower\" or \"rosette\" holes]] (\u82b1\u7a7f\u9322) which were to become fairly common by the time of the Song Dynasty (960-1279). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins has a diameter of 26.2 millimeters and a weight of 2.5 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins that also has the Chinese character (\u4e00) meaning \"one\". But unlike the earlier types the \"one\" is above the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) Chinese character at the left of the side of the Square center hole. These Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter of 26.2 millimeters and a weight of 2.4 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins where the character \"one\" (\u4e00) is below the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character at the left side  of the square center hole. The diameter of this particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to be around 25.8 millimeters and their weight tends to be around 2.7 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a particular type of Wu Zhu cash coins which has two long horizontal lines above the square center hole which may or may not represent the Chinese character (Hanzi) for \"two\" (\u4e8c). The diameter of these Wu Zhu cash coins is 23.9 millimeters and their weight is 2.1 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zhu cash coins which has two short horizontal lines above the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character at the left of the square center hole. These two parallel lines represent the Chinese character (Hanzi) for \"two\" (\u4e8c). These Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 23.3 millimeters and a weight of 1.8 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Wu Zu cash coins that was cast during the \"Six Dynasties period\" in Chinese history, during this time  some very refined cash coins were cast, however most cash coins from this period can be described as rather crude and inferior. Among these types of cash coin is an Wu Zhu can coin where the \"Zhu\" (\u9296) character to the left of the square center hole has been simplified so that only its right side component of \"Zhu\" (\u6731) appears. What is further unusual about this type of Wu Zhu cash coins is that there are two vertical bars incused just above the hole which according to Gary Ashkenazy probably represent the Chinese character for \"two\" (\u4e8c). This type of Wu Zhu cash coins have a diameter of 22.3 millimeters and a weight of 2.5 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins that have a short vertical line or bar above the square center hole. This symbol may or may not represent the Chinese number \"one\" (\u4e00) as the purpose of these marks has yet to be revealed by modern archeologists. This series of Wu Zhu cash coins tend to have a diameter is 25.65 millimeters and a weight of 2.6 grams. || \n|- \n| There is a type of Han dynasty era Wu Zhu cash coins that on their obverse side have two vertical lines in relief (known as \"\u9633\u6587\" in Mandarin Chinese) above the square center hole.

Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\n\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled ''Opportunities in Chemistry''. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

He died on 28 December 2019, after a long fight with cancer, at age 72.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsit.gr/ellada/thanos-mikroutsikos-pethane-o-megalos-synthetis/2944981/|title=\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2: \u03a0\u03ad\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2|last=|first=|date=28 December 2019|work=NewsIT|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nHe studied piano in the Philharmonic Society of Patras and in the Hellenic [[Music school|Conservatory]]. In addition, he studied [[Mathematics]] in the [[University of Athens]]. He began composing at the end of the 1960s but only officially debuted in 1975, with the release of his album ''Politika Tragoudia'' ('Political Songs'). He continued on this compositional path, setting to music the poems of [[Giannis Ritsos]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], Manos Eleftheriou and [[Bertold Brecht]], amongst others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenationalherald.com/276639/prominent-greek-composer-thanos-mikroutsikos-died//|title=Prominent Greek Composer Thanos Mikroutsikos Died|last=|first=|date=29 December 2019|work=NewsIT|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHis albums ''Kantata gia ti Makroniso'' (''[[Cantata]] for [[Makronisos]]''), ''Fouente Ovehouna'' (''[[Fuenteovejuna]]''), ''Troparia gia Foniades'' (''Hymns for Murderers'') and ''Mousiki Praxi Ston Brecht'' (''Musical Practice on [[Brecht]]'') are characteristic of the climate of [[Metapolitefsi]] or Regime Change that was taking place in the period 1975\u201378. In particular, the ''Cantata for Makronisos'', a pioneering piece in which Mikroutsikos experimented with [[atonality]] was extremely well received in international music festivals and an interpretation of particular note was recorded by [[Maria Dimitriadi]].\n\nHis next album, ''Stavros tou Notou'' (''[[Southern Cross]]''), set to the poetry of [[Nikos Kavvadias]], opened up further musical avenues for him, combining [[theatre]], [[electronic music]] and [[atonality]] (a second album, ''Grammes ton orizondon'', set to the poetry of Kavvadias was released in 1991). With the same devotion to poetry, he continued to set the works of [[Giannis Ritsos]], Alkis Alkaios, [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]] and [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], amongst others. In addition, he has written an [[opera]], ''Eleni'' (''Helen'') and set to music several children's fairytales.\n\nHe has worked with many renowned singers such as [[Maria Dimitriadi]], [[Haris Alexiou]], Manolis Mitsias, [[Dimitris Mitropanos]], [[Vasilis Papakonstantinou]], Christos Thibaios and Giannis Koutras, amongst others. His music has been particularly well received and recognised in Western Europe. During his compositional career, he has managed to liberate the form of Greek song, adding together elements from the modernist and classical [[western culture|western tradition]]. He also experimented with the combination of tonal and atonal sounds and with morphological variation.\n\nHe was artistic director of the New Music Society and the Musical Analogion, whilst he also worked with and directed the Patras International Festival.\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2.jpg|thumb|\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2]]\nHe was involved in [[Greece]]'s political life since the 1960s. During the turbulent years of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]], he was persecuted by the regime for his anti-dictatorial activities and ideas. When the junta collapsed, he continued being actively involved in politics as a member of the [[Maoism|maoist]] [[Revolutionary Communist Movement of Greece|EKKE]], especially in the first years after the restoration of [[democracy]].\n\nAfter the [[1993 Greek legislative election|elections]] of October 1993, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Culture by the new [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) government, serving alongside the late [[Melina Mercouri]] who was [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]]. He was appointed to Mercouri's position when she died in 1994, a position he kept until 1996.\n\nHe was a supporter of the [[Communist Party of Greece]].<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.gr/entry/thanos-mikroetsikos-eimai-oristika-me-to-kke_gr_5b968680e4b0511db3e4ad33</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-

He was considered one of the most important composers of the recent Greek musical scene.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Personal life===\nHe was born on 13 April 1947 in [[Patras|Patra]]. He was the older brother of [[Andreas Mikroutsikos]], who is also a musician/composer and a television show host. His wife was children's author Maria Papagianni, whom he married in 1996. He died on 28 December 2019, after a long fight with cancer, at age 72.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsit.gr/ellada/thanos-mikroutsikos-pethane-o-megalos-synthetis/2944981/|title=\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2: \u03a0\u03ad\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2|last=|first=|date=28 December 2019|work=NewsIT|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nHe studied piano in the Philharmonic Society of Patras and in the Hellenic [[Music school|Conservatory]]. In addition, he studied [[Mathematics]] in the [[University of Athens]]. He began composing at the end of the 1960s but only officially debuted in 1975, with the release of his album ''Politika Tragoudia'' ('Political Songs'). He continued on this compositional path, setting to music the poems of [[Giannis Ritsos]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], Manos Eleftheriou and [[Bertold Brecht]], amongst others.\n\nHis albums ''Kantata gia ti Makroniso'' (''[[Cantata]] for [[Makronisos]]''), ''Fouente Ovehouna'' (''[[Fuenteovejuna]]''), ''Troparia gia Foniades'' (''Hymns for Murderers'') and ''Mousiki Praxi Ston Brecht'' (''Musical Practice on [[Brecht]]'') are characteristic of the climate of [[Metapolitefsi]] or Regime Change that was taking place in the period 1975\u201378. In particular, the ''Cantata for Makronisos'', a pioneering piece in which Mikroutsikos experimented with [[atonality]] was extremely well received in international music festivals and an interpretation of particular note was recorded by [[Maria Dimitriadi]].\n\nHis next album, ''Stavros tou Notou'' (''[[Southern Cross]]''), set to the poetry of [[Nikos Kavvadias]], opened up further musical avenues for him, combining [[theatre]], [[electronic music]] and [[atonality]] (a second album, ''Grammes ton orizondon'', set to the poetry of Kavvadias was released in 1991). With the same devotion to poetry, he continued to set the works of [[Giannis Ritsos]], Alkis Alkaios, [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]] and [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], amongst others. In addition, he has written an [[opera]], ''Eleni'' (''Helen'') and set to music several children's fairytales.\n\nHe has worked with many renowned singers such as [[Maria Dimitriadi]], [[Haris Alexiou]], Manolis Mitsias, [[Dimitris Mitropanos]], [[Vasilis Papakonstantinou]], Christos Thibaios and Giannis Koutras, amongst others. His music has been particularly well received and recognised in Western Europe. During his compositional career, he has managed to liberate the form of Greek song, adding together elements from the modernist and classical [[western culture|western tradition]]. He also experimented with the combination of tonal and atonal sounds and with morphological variation.\n\nHe was artistic director of the New Music Society and the Musical Analogion, whilst he also worked with and directed the Patras International Festival.\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2.jpg|thumb|\u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2]]\nHe was involved in [[Greece]]'s political life since the 1960s. During the turbulent years of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]], he was persecuted by the regime for his anti-dictatorial activities and ideas. When the junta collapsed, he continued being actively involved in politics as a member of the [[Maoism|maoist]] [[Revolutionary Communist Movement of Greece|EKKE]], especially in the first years after the restoration of [[democracy]].\n\nAfter the [[1993 Greek legislative election|elections]] of October 1993, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Culture by the new [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) government, serving alongside the late [[Melina Mercouri]] who was [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]]. He was appointed to Mercouri's position when she died in 1994, a position he kept until 1996.\n\nHe was a supporter of the [[Communist Party of Greece]].<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.gr/entry/thanos-mikroetsikos-eimai-oristika-me-to-kke_gr_5b968680e4b0511db3e4ad33</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-

So named by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], biolinguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work that began in the 1950s as a reaction to then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which is that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. The term \u201cbiolinguistics\u201d was coined by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at MIT, and the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In  ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggested that different aspects of human biology that putitively contribute to language more than genes at play, for while they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguistics\u2014including Chomsky(ans)\u2014sometimes seem to imply. Contrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg approached language as a species-specific mental organ with non-trivial biological properties, which grows in the mind/brain of the child in the same way that (other) biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBase on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits (including language), or, put similarly, that genes can contain traits. Lenneberg then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon ontogenesis, criticizing prior hypothesis by Goodwin of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language, in particular, is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work that began in the 1950s as a reaction to then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which is that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was in effect the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. The term \u201cbiolinguistics\u201d was coined by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at MIT, and the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Di Sciullo claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, the linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics originated in the 1970s, and that it is not synonymous with transformational grammar, but rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by Charles Darwin, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In  ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggested that different aspects of human biology that putitively contribute to language more than genes at play, for while they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguistics\u2014including Chomsky(ans)\u2014sometimes seem to imply. Contrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg approached language as a species-specific mental organ with non-trivial biological properties, which grows in the mind/brain of the child in the same way that (other) biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBase on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits (including language), or, put similarly, that genes can contain traits. Lenneberg then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon ontogenesis, criticizing prior hypothesis by Goodwin of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language, in particular, is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters. As a result, UG can be summed up as a system of [[principles and parameters]], a model proposed by Chomsky. The goal of biolinguists, with regard to language acquisition, is to come up with the formulation of genetic principles of UG narrowly enough constrained to account for the child\u2019s ability to learn structural properties of grammar of great subtlety from impoverished linguistic data and at the same time, find parameters that can account for manifest variations among different languages.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Lyle |title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the biology of language |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York, NY |pages=76\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nSome of the areas of study of language acquisition include:\n\n*Determine what the set of parameters are that are found in UG\n*[[Word order]]\n\nIn language acquisition, one of the arguments supporting the biolinguisitc view is [[poverty of the stimulus]],<ref name=\"project muse\" /><ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> a term coined by Chomsky in 1980, which contends that the linguistic environment that children are exposed to is not rich enough to account for all the information that they have acquired. In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.
