[[Baal]] was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:17-19|NRSV}}</ref>\n\n==== Widow of Zarephath ====\n{{main|Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath}}\n[[File:ElijahByLouisHersent.JPG|thumb|''Elijah reviving the Son of the Widow of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]]'' by [[Louis Hersent]]]]\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook [[Chorath]], east of the [[Jordan river|Jordan]], where he will be fed by [[Cultural depictions of ravens|raven]]s.<ref>1 Kings 17; {{cite web|title= The Peraea and the Dead Sea|url= http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|publisher= The Madaba Mosaic Map|accessdate= 13 October 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182851/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|archive-date= 27 July 2011|url-status= dead}}</ref> When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]] in [[Phoenicia]]. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid...For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:13, 14, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her \"[[manna]]\" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:18|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''.</ref> Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God \"listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\"<ref>''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:24|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version.''</ref>\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\n\n==== Challenge to Baal ====\n[[File:Elijahwindow.jpg|thumb|Elijah's offering is consumed by fire from heaven in a stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]\n\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah takes notice of his [[hypocrisy]] and tells Ahab that he is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|NRSV}}</ref> And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\n\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel]]. An altar is built for Baal. Wood is laid on the altar. An ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Kings|18:27|NRSV}}</ref> They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\n\nElijah builds an altar from twelve stones, digs a huge trench around it, lays wood on it, slaughters another ox, cuts it up, and lays it on the wood. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33\u201334|NIV}}</ref> He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\n\n==== Mount Horeb ====\n[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201313|HE}}</ref> Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\n\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]],<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Elijah |volume=9 |pages=273\u2013274 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Stanley Arthur |last2=Cook}}</ref> where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]. God again speaks to Elijah:<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref> \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|A statue of Elijah in the Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\nFile:Elijah's cave P3160005.JPG|The Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n==== Vineyard of Naboth ====\nElijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\n\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|21:19|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]].\n\n==== Ahaziah ====\n[[File:094.Elijah Destroys the Messengers of Ahaziah.jpg|thumb|Elijah destroying the messengers of Ahaziah (illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] ([[2 Kings 1]]). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\"<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|NRSV}}</ref> Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\n\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.<ref>[[2 Kings 1:17]]</ref>\n\n==== Departure ====\n[[File:Elijah Departure and Elisha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elijah Departure and Elisha, Russian Orthodox icon of 17th century]]\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3\u20139|HE}}, [[Elisha]] (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\n\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}</ref> The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear<ref name=EB1911/> and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\n\n=== Final mention: 2nd Chronicles ===\nElijah is mentioned once more in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|21:12|HE}}, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. Michael Wilcock, formerly of [[Trinity College, Bristol]], suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<ref>Myers, J. M. ''The Anchor Bible: II Chronicles.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1965. pp. 121\u201323.</ref> [[John Van Seters]], however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition.<ref>VanSeters, John. \"Elijah.\" In Jones, Lindsay. Editor in Chief. ''Encyclopedia of Religion.'' Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2005. p. 2764.</ref> However, Wilcock argues that Elijah's letter \"does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom\", and thus is authentic.<ref>IVP New Bible Commentary 21st Century Edition, p. 410.</ref>\n\n=== The Christian end of Elijah in Malachi ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.

Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: \"and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|ESV}}</ref> Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] believe that Elijah visited Earth at the dedication of the [[Kirtland Temple]].\n\n=== One theory of textual analysis ===\n[[File:SaintIliaFromRilaMonastery.jpg|thumb|Saint Elias in the cave (below) and on a chariot of fire. A fresco from [[Rila Monastery]], Bulgaria, medieval [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition, renovated 20th century]]\nAccording to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages. The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]'s vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]'s coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom. The narratives about the [[Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards God determines the fate of Israel. According to Otto, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17\u201318|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment. Additionally, Otto suggests that in the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201318|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel. The foregoing Otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.<ref name=otto>\n{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Susanne |url=http://jot.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/487 |title=Susanne Otto, \"The Composition of the Elijah-Elisha Stories and the Deuteronomistic History\"|journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508 |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}(Online Abstract)</ref>\n\n== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books ==\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the [[aggadah]], which is found throughout various collections of [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or \"translation\"{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\n\nFrom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\" ([[Malachi 4:5|Malachi 3:23 in Hebrew Bible]]), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\n\n=== Origin ===\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,<ref>Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.</ref>\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|8:27|HE}}, and\n(3) he was a priest.\n\nMany Christian Church fathers also<ref>Aphraates, \"Homilies,\" ed. Wright, p.&nbsp;314; Epiphanius, \"H\u00e6res.\" lv. 3, passim</ref> have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some Rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with [[Phinehas]].<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xlvii.; Targ. Yer. on Num. xxv. 12</ref>\n\nAccording to later [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature, Elijah was really an [[angel]] in human form,<ref name=EB1911/> so that he had neither parents nor offspring.<ref>Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Reubeni, Bereshit, 9a, ed. Amsterdam</ref>\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\n\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"<ref>Baba Metzia 14B</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's zeal for God ===\n[[File:Statue of Saint Elijah at Saint Elijah Maronite Cathedral, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nIn spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before. A [[midrash]]{{which|date=February 2019}} tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxix.</ref>\n\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.<ref>Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu\u1e6da viii.</ref>\n\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.<ref>Tan., Pe\u1e33ude, p.&nbsp;128, Vienna ed.</ref>\n\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated.\"<ref>Seder 'Olam R. xvii.</ref> Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.<ref>\u1e32id. 70; Ber.

The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads \"This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good.\"]]\n\nAt Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\" ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}}). According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.<ref>\"Elijah, Chair of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref><ref>Unterman, Alan. \"Elijah's Chair.\" ''Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1991.</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's cup ===\n{{See also|Passover Seder}}\nIn the [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]], Elijah would visit [[rabbis]] to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"<ref>\"Elijah, Cup of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref>\n\nOne such decision was whether the [[Passover Seder]] required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the [[Book of Exodus]]:\n\n<blockquote>I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe next verse, \"And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\n\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.<ref name=\" Temple\">Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish Literacy.''

As part of the concluding [[hymn]], an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\n== Elijah in Jewish folklore ==\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 580.</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:25|HE}}). Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\" ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|25:13|HE}}). Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel [[Sandalphon]],<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Jewish Philadelphia: Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 589</ref> whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. pp. 590\u201391.</ref> Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood)<ref>Bialik, H. N. and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki|Y. H Ravnitzky]]. eds. ''The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha-Aggadah.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1992. pp. 756, 782, 805.</ref> to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\n\nOne such story is that of Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]]. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\n\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 599.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Eliezer ===\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai|Simon ben Yohai]] is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 597.</ref>\n\n=== Lilith ===\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of [[Lilith]]. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956.</ref>\n\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\n\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 224\u201325.</ref>\n\n== Elijah in Christianity ==\n=== References in the New Testament ===\n[[File:Intesa elijah.jpg|thumb|A Northern Russian icon from ca. 1290 showing the ascent of Elijah toward heaven]]\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] would say for those who believed, [[John the Baptist]] was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by [[Malachi]].\n\nSome English translations of the New Testament use [[Elias]], a Latin form of the name. In the [[King James Version]], \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\n\n==== John the Baptist ====\n[[John the Baptist]] preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ([[Matthew 3:4]], {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}}). He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\n\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\" ({{Bibleverse||John|1:21|9}}). {{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:10\u201313|9}} however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]] in Luke, [[Gabriel]] appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|9}}).\n\n==== Jesus Christ ====\n[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|right|Elijah appeared at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].]]\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Herod Antipas]] hears some of the stories surrounding [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) come back to life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:7\u20139|9}} also {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:14\u201316|9}}</ref> Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:18\u201319|9}}, also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|16:13\u201316|9}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jesus' ministry had little in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. [[Miracle]] stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (''e.g.'', raising of the dead,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|5:21\u201343|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|7:11\u201315|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|8:49\u201356|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|11|9}}</ref> miraculous feeding).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:13\u201321|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:34\u201345|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:10\u201317|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|6:5\u201316|9}}; also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:29\u201338|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|8:1\u20139|9}}</ref> Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:51\u201356|9}}</ref> Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:61\u201362|9}}, {{Bibleverse||1 Kings|19:16\u201321|9}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]], some of the onlookers wonder if Elijah will come to rescue him,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:46\u201349|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:35\u201336|9}}</ref> as by the time of Jesus, Elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of Jews in distress.\n\n==== Transfiguration ====\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:1\u201313|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|9:2\u201313|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:28\u201336|9}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.<!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source. -->\n\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced [[Son of God]].<ref>Albright, W.

In {{Bibleverse||Luke|4:24\u201327|9}}, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets. Jesus says, \"No prophet is accepted in his own country,\" and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In {{Bibleverse||Romans|11:1\u20136|9}}, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:35|9}} (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|raising the son of the woman of Shunem]], citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith.<ref name=\"HebrewsGill\">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=John |title=Hebrews 11:35 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/hebrews-11-35.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsHenry\">{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Hebrews 11 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/hebrews/11.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsJamieson\">{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Robert Jamieson, A.

In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first [[hermit]]s of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life.<ref>Ackerman, Jane. \"Stories of Elijah and medieval Carmelite identity.\" ''History of Religions.'' 35(2). 1995. 124\u201347.</ref><ref>Ackerman, Jane.

In writing of St. [[Albert Avogadro|Albert]], Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist [[Daniel Papebroch]] stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly.  From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of [[Jean de Launoy]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. In November 1698, [[Pope Innocent XII]] ordered an end to the controversy.<ref>[http://carmelitenuns.com/Controversies_Oother_Orders.htm  \"Controversies with Other Orders\", The Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\"]</ref>\n\n==== Liturgical commemorations ====\n[[Image:Prophet-Elias-Grk-ikon.png|thumb|Elias on [[Mount Horeb]], as depicted in a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]]]\n\nSince most [[Eastern Churches]] either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, ''Elias'' (or its modern [[iotacism|iotacized]] form ''Ilias'') is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\nThe [[feast day]] of [[saint]] Elias falls on July 20 of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 20 currently falls on August 2 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\n\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe [[Apolytikion]] in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Kontakion]] in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.</blockquote>\n\n==== {{anchor|Helios}}Pagan associations and mountaintops ====\n{{See also|Peryn#The cult of Peroun in Peryn and in Novgorod}}\n\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with [[Helios]], the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ([[2 Kings 2:11]]) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth.<ref>J.

Wachsmuth, ''Das alte Griechenland im neuen'', 1864, p. 23, cited by Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'', 1907, p. 174</ref> the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias.<ref>Delehaye, p. 174</ref> The modern folklore is not good evidence for the ''origin'' of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops.<ref name=\"cook\"/> Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".<ref>F.

When Elias prevailed over the priests of [[Baal]], it was on [[Mount Carmel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}), which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on [[Mount Horeb]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|9}}).

Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.<ref name=\"cook\" />\n\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\n\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to [[Ljuboten]] on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as ''Aligjyn'' (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elsie |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtQZ0vjf5gC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22Ali%20day%22%20Aligjyni&f=false |title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |publisher=NYU Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0814722145 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ilia chariot.jpg|thumb|This common depiction of the prophet Elijah riding a flaming chariot across the sky resulted in [[syncretism|syncretistic]] folklore among the [[Slavs]] incorporating pre-Christian motifs in the beliefs and rites regarding him in [[Slavic culture]].]]\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted [[Slavic tribes]] likely found him an ideal analogy for [[Perun#Post-Christian Perun|Perun]], the supreme [[Slavic mythology#Pantheon|Slavic god]] of storms, thunder and lightning bolts.

The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of [[Baal]], the primary [[Idolatry|idol]] of the area. The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles.

Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven<ref name=\"djytel\">{{cite web |last=Coram |first=James |url=http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |title=biblical studies: The Fate of Enoch and Elijah |publisher=Concordant Publishing Concern |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522142440/http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |archivedate=2013-05-22 }}</ref> or with [[Jehoram of Judah|King Jehoram of Judah]].<ref name = \"djytel\"/> The prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away, and not simply straight up ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:16|9}}).\n\nThe question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21 after Elijah had ascended.

It can be shown that a letter was received by Jehoram, King of Judah, from Elijah, after Elijah was taken to heaven. Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was \"caught away\" as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39, 40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10, 11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 9\u201312). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.

For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:9\u201313|9}}).

The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah's life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the [[New German School]] but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.\n* In his ethnography ''[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape]'', anthropologist [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107] discusses the [[syncretic]] harvest feast of Elijah's Day (''Ilindan/Ali\u0111un''), shared by Christians and Muslims throughout [[Bosnia]].<ref>Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107, S.

Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah's two names \"Ilija until noon - Alija after noon\" (''Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija''), Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity [[Perun]] and prophet [[Khidr]]). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah's return. \n* In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', the English knight [[Astolfo]] flies up to the moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.\n* [[Elijah Rock]] is a traditional Christian [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] about Elijah, also sometimes used by Jewish youth groups.\n* \"Go Like Elijah\" is a song by the American rock-pop-jazz songwriter [[Chi Coltrane]].\n* [[Lorenzetto]] created a statue of Elijah with assistance of the young sculptor [[Raffaello da Montelupo]], using designs by Raphael.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |title=Link to on-line biography of Lorenzetto from Vasari's '&#39;Vite'&#39; |publisher=Efn.org |accessdate=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222204918/http://efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |archive-date=2009-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Fifth Mountain]]'' by [[Paulo Coelho]] is based on the story of Elijah.\n* Christian metal band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] released the song \"God of Elijah\" on their 2001 album [[By God]].

[[Baal]] was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:17-19|NRSV}}</ref>\n\n==== Widow of Zarephath ====\n{{main|Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath}}\n[[File:ElijahByLouisHersent.JPG|thumb|''Elijah reviving the Son of the Widow of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]]'' by [[Louis Hersent]]]]\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook [[Chorath]], east of the [[Jordan river|Jordan]], where he will be fed by [[Cultural depictions of ravens|raven]]s.<ref>1 Kings 17; {{cite web|title= The Peraea and the Dead Sea|url= http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|publisher= The Madaba Mosaic Map|accessdate= 13 October 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182851/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|archive-date= 27 July 2011|url-status= dead}}</ref> When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]] in [[Phoenicia]]. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid...For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:13, 14, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her \"[[manna]]\" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:18|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''.</ref> Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God \"listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\"<ref>''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:24|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version.''</ref>\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\n\n==== Challenge to Baal ====\n[[File:Elijahwindow.jpg|thumb|Elijah's offering is consumed by fire from heaven in a stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]\n\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah takes notice of his [[hypocrisy]] and tells Ahab that he is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|NRSV}}</ref> And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\n\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel]]. An altar is built for Baal. Wood is laid on the altar. An ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Kings|18:27|NRSV}}</ref> They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\n\nElijah builds an altar from twelve stones, digs a huge trench around it, lays wood on it, slaughters another ox, cuts it up, and lays it on the wood. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33\u201334|NIV}}</ref> He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\n\n==== Mount Horeb ====\n[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201313|HE}}</ref> Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\n\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]],<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Elijah |volume=9 |pages=273\u2013274 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Stanley Arthur |last2=Cook}}</ref> where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]. God again speaks to Elijah:<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref> \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|A statue of Elijah in the Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\nFile:Elijah's cave P3160005.JPG|The Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n==== Vineyard of Naboth ====\nElijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\n\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|21:19|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]].\n\n==== Ahaziah ====\n[[File:094.Elijah Destroys the Messengers of Ahaziah.jpg|thumb|Elijah destroying the messengers of Ahaziah (illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] ([[2 Kings 1]]). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\"<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|NRSV}}</ref> Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\n\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.<ref>[[2 Kings 1:17]]</ref>\n\n==== Departure ====\n[[File:Elijah Departure and Elisha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elijah Departure and Elisha, Russian Orthodox icon of 17th century]]\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3\u20139|HE}}, [[Elisha]] (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\n\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}</ref> The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear<ref name=EB1911/> and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\n\n=== Final mention: 2nd Chronicles ===\nElijah is mentioned once more in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|21:12|HE}}, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. Michael Wilcock, formerly of [[Trinity College, Bristol]], suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<ref>Myers, J. M. ''The Anchor Bible: II Chronicles.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1965. pp. 121\u201323.</ref> [[John Van Seters]], however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition.<ref>VanSeters, John. \"Elijah.\" In Jones, Lindsay. Editor in Chief. ''Encyclopedia of Religion.'' Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2005. p. 2764.</ref> However, Wilcock argues that Elijah's letter \"does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom\", and thus is authentic.<ref>IVP New Bible Commentary 21st Century Edition, p. 410.</ref>\n\n=== The Christian end of Elijah in Malachi ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.

Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: \"and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|ESV}}</ref> Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] believe that Elijah visited Earth at the dedication of the [[Kirtland Temple]].\n\n=== One theory of textual analysis ===\n[[File:SaintIliaFromRilaMonastery.jpg|thumb|Saint Elias in the cave (below) and on a chariot of fire. A fresco from [[Rila Monastery]], Bulgaria, medieval [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition, renovated 20th century]]\nAccording to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages. The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]'s vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]'s coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom. The narratives about the [[Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards God determines the fate of Israel. According to Otto, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17\u201318|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment. Additionally, Otto suggests that in the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201318|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel. The foregoing Otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.<ref name=otto>\n{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Susanne |url=http://jot.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/487 |title=Susanne Otto, \"The Composition of the Elijah-Elisha Stories and the Deuteronomistic History\"|journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508 |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}(Online Abstract)</ref>\n\n== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books ==\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the [[aggadah]], which is found throughout various collections of [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or \"translation\"{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\n\nFrom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\" ([[Malachi 4:5|Malachi 3:23 in Hebrew Bible]]), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\n\n=== Origin ===\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,<ref>Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.</ref>\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|8:27|HE}}, and\n(3) he was a priest.\n\nMany Christian Church fathers also<ref>Aphraates, \"Homilies,\" ed. Wright, p.&nbsp;314; Epiphanius, \"H\u00e6res.\" lv. 3, passim</ref> have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some Rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with [[Phinehas]].<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xlvii.; Targ. Yer. on Num. xxv. 12</ref>\n\nAccording to later [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature, Elijah was really an [[angel]] in human form,<ref name=EB1911/> so that he had neither parents nor offspring.<ref>Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Reubeni, Bereshit, 9a, ed. Amsterdam</ref>\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\n\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"<ref>Baba Metzia 14B</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's zeal for God ===\n[[File:Statue of Saint Elijah at Saint Elijah Maronite Cathedral, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nIn spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before. A [[midrash]]{{which|date=February 2019}} tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxix.</ref>\n\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.<ref>Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu\u1e6da viii.</ref>\n\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.<ref>Tan., Pe\u1e33ude, p.&nbsp;128, Vienna ed.</ref>\n\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated.\"<ref>Seder 'Olam R. xvii.</ref> Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.<ref>\u1e32id. 70; Ber.

The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads \"This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good.\"]]\n\nAt Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\" ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}}). According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.<ref>\"Elijah, Chair of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref><ref>Unterman, Alan. \"Elijah's Chair.\" ''Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1991.</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's cup ===\n{{See also|Passover Seder}}\nIn the [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]], Elijah would visit [[rabbis]] to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"<ref>\"Elijah, Cup of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref>\n\nOne such decision was whether the [[Passover Seder]] required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the [[Book of Exodus]]:\n\n<blockquote>I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe next verse, \"And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\n\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.<ref name=\" Temple\">Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish Literacy.''

As part of the concluding [[hymn]], an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\n== Elijah in Jewish folklore ==\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 580.</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:25|HE}}). Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\" ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|25:13|HE}}). Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel [[Sandalphon]],<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Jewish Philadelphia: Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 589</ref> whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. pp. 590\u201391.</ref> Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood)<ref>Bialik, H. N. and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki|Y. H Ravnitzky]]. eds. ''The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha-Aggadah.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1992. pp. 756, 782, 805.</ref> to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\n\nOne such story is that of Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]]. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\n\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 599.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Eliezer ===\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai|Simon ben Yohai]] is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 597.</ref>\n\n=== Lilith ===\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of [[Lilith]]. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956.</ref>\n\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\n\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 224\u201325.</ref>\n\n== Elijah in Christianity ==\n=== References in the New Testament ===\n[[File:Intesa elijah.jpg|thumb|A Northern Russian icon from ca. 1290 showing the ascent of Elijah toward heaven]]\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] would say for those who believed, [[John the Baptist]] was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by [[Malachi]].\n\nSome English translations of the New Testament use [[Elias]], a Latin form of the name. In the [[King James Version]], \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\n\n==== John the Baptist ====\n[[John the Baptist]] preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ([[Matthew 3:4]], {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}}). He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\n\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\" ({{Bibleverse||John|1:21|9}}). {{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:10\u201313|9}} however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]] in Luke, [[Gabriel]] appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|9}}).\n\n==== Jesus Christ ====\n[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|right|Elijah appeared at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].]]\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Herod Antipas]] hears some of the stories surrounding [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) come back to life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:7\u20139|9}} also {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:14\u201316|9}}</ref> Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:18\u201319|9}}, also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|16:13\u201316|9}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jesus' ministry had little in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. [[Miracle]] stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (''e.g.'', raising of the dead,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|5:21\u201343|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|7:11\u201315|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|8:49\u201356|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|11|9}}</ref> miraculous feeding).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:13\u201321|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:34\u201345|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:10\u201317|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|6:5\u201316|9}}; also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:29\u201338|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|8:1\u20139|9}}</ref> Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:51\u201356|9}}</ref> Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:61\u201362|9}}, {{Bibleverse||1 Kings|19:16\u201321|9}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]], some of the onlookers wonder if Elijah will come to rescue him,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:46\u201349|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:35\u201336|9}}</ref> as by the time of Jesus, Elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of Jews in distress.\n\n==== Transfiguration ====\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:1\u201313|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|9:2\u201313|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:28\u201336|9}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.<!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source. -->\n\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced [[Son of God]].<ref>Albright, W.

In {{Bibleverse||Luke|4:24\u201327|9}}, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets. Jesus says, \"No prophet is accepted in his own country,\" and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In {{Bibleverse||Romans|11:1\u20136|9}}, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:35|9}} (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|raising the son of the woman of Shunem]], citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith.<ref name=\"HebrewsGill\">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=John |title=Hebrews 11:35 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/hebrews-11-35.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsHenry\">{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Hebrews 11 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/hebrews/11.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsJamieson\">{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Robert Jamieson, A.

In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first [[hermit]]s of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life.<ref>Ackerman, Jane. \"Stories of Elijah and medieval Carmelite identity.\" ''History of Religions.'' 35(2). 1995. 124\u201347.</ref><ref>Ackerman, Jane.

In writing of St. [[Albert Avogadro|Albert]], Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist [[Daniel Papebroch]] stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly.  From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of [[Jean de Launoy]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. In November 1698, [[Pope Innocent XII]] ordered an end to the controversy.<ref>[http://carmelitenuns.com/Controversies_Oother_Orders.htm  \"Controversies with Other Orders\", The Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\"]</ref>\n\n==== Liturgical commemorations ====\n[[Image:Prophet-Elias-Grk-ikon.png|thumb|Elias on [[Mount Horeb]], as depicted in a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]]]\n\nSince most [[Eastern Churches]] either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, ''Elias'' (or its modern [[iotacism|iotacized]] form ''Ilias'') is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\nThe [[feast day]] of [[saint]] Elias falls on July 20 of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 20 currently falls on August 2 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\n\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe [[Apolytikion]] in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Kontakion]] in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.</blockquote>\n\n==== {{anchor|Helios}}Pagan associations and mountaintops ====\n{{See also|Peryn#The cult of Peroun in Peryn and in Novgorod}}\n\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with [[Helios]], the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ([[2 Kings 2:11]]) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth.<ref>J.

Wachsmuth, ''Das alte Griechenland im neuen'', 1864, p. 23, cited by Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'', 1907, p. 174</ref> the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias.<ref>Delehaye, p. 174</ref> The modern folklore is not good evidence for the ''origin'' of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops.<ref name=\"cook\"/> Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".<ref>F.

When Elias prevailed over the priests of [[Baal]], it was on [[Mount Carmel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}), which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on [[Mount Horeb]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|9}}).

Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.<ref name=\"cook\" />\n\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\n\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to [[Ljuboten]] on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as ''Aligjyn'' (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elsie |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtQZ0vjf5gC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22Ali%20day%22%20Aligjyni&f=false |title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |publisher=NYU Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0814722145 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ilia chariot.jpg|thumb|This common depiction of the prophet Elijah riding a flaming chariot across the sky resulted in [[syncretism|syncretistic]] folklore among the [[Slavs]] incorporating pre-Christian motifs in the beliefs and rites regarding him in [[Slavic culture]].]]\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted [[Slavic tribes]] likely found him an ideal analogy for [[Perun#Post-Christian Perun|Perun]], the supreme [[Slavic mythology#Pantheon|Slavic god]] of storms, thunder and lightning bolts.

The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of [[Baal]], the primary [[Idolatry|idol]] of the area. The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles.

Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven<ref name=\"djytel\">{{cite web |last=Coram |first=James |url=http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |title=biblical studies: The Fate of Enoch and Elijah |publisher=Concordant Publishing Concern |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522142440/http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |archivedate=2013-05-22 }}</ref> or with [[Jehoram of Judah|King Jehoram of Judah]].<ref name = \"djytel\"/> The prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away, and not simply straight up ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:16|9}}).\n\nThe question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21 after Elijah had ascended.

It can be shown that a letter was received by Jehoram, King of Judah, from Elijah, after Elijah was taken to heaven. Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was \"caught away\" as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39, 40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10, 11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 9\u201312). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.

For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:9\u201313|9}}).

The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah's life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the [[New German School]] but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.\n* In his ethnography ''[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape]'', anthropologist [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107] discusses the [[syncretic]] harvest feast of Elijah's Day (''Ilindan/Ali\u0111un''), shared by Christians and Muslims throughout [[Bosnia]].<ref>Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107, S.

Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah's two names \"Ilija until noon - Alija after noon\" (''Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija''), Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity [[Perun]] and prophet [[Khidr]]). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah's return. \n* In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', the English knight [[Astolfo]] flies up to the moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.\n* [[Elijah Rock]] is a traditional Christian [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] about Elijah, also sometimes used by Jewish youth groups.\n* \"Go Like Elijah\" is a song by the American rock-pop-jazz songwriter [[Chi Coltrane]].\n* [[Lorenzetto]] created a statue of Elijah with assistance of the young sculptor [[Raffaello da Montelupo]], using designs by Raphael.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |title=Link to on-line biography of Lorenzetto from Vasari's '&#39;Vite'&#39; |publisher=Efn.org |accessdate=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222204918/http://efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |archive-date=2009-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Fifth Mountain]]'' by [[Paulo Coelho]] is based on the story of Elijah.\n* Christian metal band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] released the song \"God of Elijah\" on their 2001 album [[By God]].

It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''{{lang|de|Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733}}''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch.

Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the {{lang|la|Missa}},{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Last accessed August 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nAround 1745 Bach used three movements of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] of the {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 for his cantata [[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure \u2014 incorporation in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ==\n{{Main|Mass in B minor structure}}\n\nIn the last years of his life, presumably around 1748\u20131749, Bach integrated the complete {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 unchanged in his [[Mass in B minor]], his only missa tota.<ref name=\"Laurson\" /> Scoring and structure are identical with the later work, but markings differ because the parts contain more details than the 1733 score which he kept. Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''{{lang|de|Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733}}''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I. Kyrie and Gloria (\"Missa\")|Part I of BWV&nbsp;232]].<ref name=\"BDW0290\">Bach Digital Work {{BDW|0290}} at {{url|www.bach-digital.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Bach's church music in Latin}}\nBach was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician, devoted to the composition of sacred music in German. He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T. David and Arthur Mendel, ''The Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents'', W. W. Norton & Company, 1945, p. 128.

Norton & Co Inc, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-393-04558-1}} , p. 158.)</ref> Petitions to the new ruler after the death of the previous one, as the one sent by Bach, were not exceptional in nature: similar petitions by musicians to August III included those of [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]] (unsuccessfully competing with [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] for the post of [[Kapellmeister]]),<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\">[http://www.earlymusicworld.com/id16.html Dresden in the time of Zelenka and Hasse] at {{url|earlymusicworld.com}}, quoted from ''Goldberg Early Music Magazine''.</ref> [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] and [[Pantaleon Hebenstreit]] (a Lutheran court church director).{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p= 40}} What was exceptional was that Bach accompanied his petition with a composition of considerable dimensions \u2014 a liturgical composition, no less \u2014 which was surprising in that Bach was then employed as a Lutheran church composer and was here presenting a work for the Catholic liturgy.\n[[File:LageEhemaligesOpernhausAmTaschenberg1828.jpg|thumb|500px|This detail from an 1828 map of Dresden shows the location of the [[Opernhaus am Taschenberg]], the court theatre that in the 1660s was built adjacent to the Elector's palace, then in 1708 transformed into the Catholic Hofkirche, and, by the time this map was drawn, after building the [[Hofkirche (Dresden)|Katholische Kirche]] (1739\u20131751), among others, transformed into an archive (indicated as \"'''Archiv'''\" in the middle of this picture).<ref>\"Musical chronicle of the city of Dresden.\" in Medien-Info by Dresden Marketing GmbH, 2013</ref><br />The location of the [[Sophienkirche, Dresden|Sophienkirche]] is shown in the lower part of this detail.]]\nAt the time, Germany lived under the ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' principle (inhabitants of a region have to follow the religion of their ruler), which led to a somewhat double situation in Dresden under August the Strong: officially Catholic in Poland but only privately so in Dresden \u2014 no Catholicism was imposed on Lutheran Saxony, and only the court at Dresden was Catholic.{{sfn|Leaver|2013|pp=25-27}} Lutherans, including the [[Electress#Electresses of Saxony|Electress]] [[Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Christiane Eberhardine]], who steadfastly refused to convert to Catholicism (and for whom Bach had composed his ''[[Trauer-Ode|Trauerode]]'' when she died in 1727),<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> had the [[Sophienkirche, Dresden|Sophienkirche]] as their place of worship,{{efn|Note that the Sophienkirche was not called the Hofkirche before 1737, so for the purposes of this article about a 1733 composition, \"Hofkirche\" refers exclusively to the ''Catholic'' court church housed in the former [[Opernhaus am Taschenberg]] and served by the court chapel musicians (also predating plans for the later [[Hofkirche (Dresden)|Hofkirche/Cathedral]] built between the later [[Schlo\u00dfplatz (Dresden)|Schlo\u00dfplatz]] and Theaterplatz within about half a decade).}} while the Catholic Hofkirche (Court church) was housed in the former [[Opernhaus am Taschenberg|court theatre]] from 1708.{{sfn|Leaver|2013|p=27}}\n\nLuther had not rejected any of the [[Mass (music)|five parts of the Mass ordinary that traditionally were eligible for a musical setting]] (Kyrie, Gloria, [[Nicene Creed]], Sanctus, {{nowrap|Agnus Dei}}): Protestant mass celebrations could include any of these and/or their translation in the local language.{{sfn|Leaver|2013|pp=24-25}} There is no doubt that Bach admired his ancestor [[Veit Bach|Veit]] for his Lutheranism.{{sfn|Leaver|2013|pp=}} In all probability Bach wrote a Lutheran liturgical composition that would have been just as acceptable in a Catholic mass. At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch.

Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the {{lang|la|Missa}},{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza Credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Last accessed August 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nAround 1745 Bach used three movements of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] of the {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 for his cantata [[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure \u2014 incorporation in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ==\n{{Main|Mass in B minor structure}}\n\nIn the last years of his life, presumably around 1748\u20131749, Bach integrated the complete {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 unchanged in his [[Mass in B minor]], his only missa tota.<ref name=\"Laurson\" /> Scoring and structure are identical with the later work, but markings differ because the parts contain more details than the 1733 score which he kept. Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The [[Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration|Training Course in Personnel Administration]], founded at [[Radcliffe College]] in 1937, was the beginning of business training for women at Harvard.

In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted to apply to join the HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, the faculty voted to allow women to enter the MBA program directly.
