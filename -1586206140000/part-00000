The team had to ask for donations in order to be able to go to the games. Hungary played with [[England national football team|England]] and lost 7\u20130 and thus were eliminated.\nAfter the Olympic Games Hungary played two matches against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in [[Moscow]]. The first match was won by 9\u20130 while the second 12\u20130 which is still a record of the national side. The top scorer of the two matches was [[Imre Schlosser]] who scored seven goals. The beginning of [[World War I]] had a deep impact on the thriving Hungarian football. Not only was the country suffering financial problems but the clubs were too. During [[World War I]] Hungary played [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 16 times. In 1919 England claimed the exclusion of the [[Central Powers]] (including Hungary) from [[FIFA]]. Since FIFA refused England's plea, the British and the [[Irish Football Association|Irish]] associations ([[The Football Association|English]], [[The Scottish FA|Scottish]], [[Welsh Football Association|Welsh]]) decided to resign from FIFA.\n\n== 1920s ==\n[[File:Wawrzynieccyl.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Poland national football team|Poland]]-Hungary in 1924]]\nBudapest was denied the opportunity to host the Summer Olympics in 1920, therefore it was held in [[1920 Summer Olympics|Belgium]]. Moreover, the countries of the [[Central Powers]] (Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]]) were excluded from the Olympics. During this period the Fogl brothers ([[J\u00f3zsef Fogl]] and [[K\u00e1roly Fogl]]) played in the national team. The formation the Hungarians used was 2\u20133\u20135 which was unique at that time. In 1924 the national team played at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], France. In the first match Hungary beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] but in the second round they lost to [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]]. As a consequence, both the head coach and the head of the [[Hungarian Football Federation]] resigned.\nBetween 1927 and 1930 Hungary participated in the Europa Cup, which is considered as the first international tournament, with [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Russia national football team|Russia]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].

The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996 Hungary reached its lowest [[FIFA ranking]] (87). The fall of the [[Communist]] regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] and [[\u00dajpest FC|\u00dajpest]] faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencv\u00e1ros, \u00dajpest, Honv\u00e9d and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the [[Bosman ruling]]. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with the richer Western European clubs. The crisis in the Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.<br/>\nThe Hungarian legend [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s|Pusk\u00e1s]] was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success.

Consequently, the coaching of the former [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Honv\u00e9d]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] legend could not change anything.

The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996 Hungary reached its lowest [[FIFA ranking]] (87). The fall of the [[Communist]] regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] and [[\u00dajpest FC|\u00dajpest]] faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencv\u00e1ros, \u00dajpest, Honv\u00e9d and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the [[Bosman ruling]]. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with the richer Western European clubs. The crisis in the Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.<br/>\nThe Hungarian legend [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s|Pusk\u00e1s]] was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. However, he led the team during only four matches. Consequently, the coaching of the former [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Honv\u00e9d]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] legend could not change anything. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of the Hungarian national team for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. [[Antal Dunai|Dunai]]'s team played its first group match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and lost to 1\u20130 in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197142/matches/match=32224/report.html|title=Nigeria \u2013 Hungary 1:0 (0:0)|publisher=FIFA|date=21 July 1996|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> In the second group match Hungary played with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and lost to 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197142/matches/match=32231/report.html |title=Brazil \u2013 Hungary 3:1 (1:0) |publisher=FIFA |date=23 July 1996 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722134821/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D512/edition%3D197142/matches/match%3D32231/report.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}</ref> The only Hungarian goal was scored by [[Csaba Madar|Madar]].

However, other significant players did not emerge in order to form a strong national team which resulted the consecutive failures of the qualification for the international competitions in the 2000s. Hungary were unable to qualify for the [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro]] [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] and for [[FIFA World Cup]] [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. Moreover, during the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|UEFA Euro 2008 qualification]] Hungary finished sixth in their group reaching their nadir in their football history. They even lost to [[Malta national football team|Malta]] which resulted the resignation of [[P\u00e9ter Bozsik|Bozsik]]. Couple of days later [[P\u00e9ter V\u00e1rhidi|V\u00e1rhidi]] was appointed who was famous for his appearances in the [[Sport 1 (Europe)|Sport 1]], Hungarian sport television, and analysing the Italian [[Serie A]] clubs.

It is one of the most mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history with over 37 million units having been made since its inception in 1891, and, in spite of its age, it has been used in various conflicts around the world up to the present day. It is primarily found chambered for its original [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].\n\n==History==\n===Initial design and tests===\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Ottoman War of 1877\u20131878]], Russian troops armed mostly with [[Berdan rifle|Berdan single-shot rifles]] suffered heavy casualties against [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops equipped with [[Winchester rifle|Winchester repeating rifles]], particularly at the bloody [[Siege of Pleven]]. This showed Russian commanders the need to modernize the general infantry weapon of the army.\n\nVarious weapons were acquired and tested by [[GRAU|GAU]] of the Ministry of Defense of Russian Empire, and in 1889 the [[Lebel M1886]] was obtained through semi-official channels from France. It was supplied together with a model of the cartridge and bullet but without the primer and the smokeless powder. Those problems were solved by Russian scientists and engineers (the smokeless powder, for instance, was produced by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] himself).\n\nIn 1889, three rifles were submitted for evaluation: Captain [[Sergei Ivanovich Mosin]] of the imperial army submitted his \"3-line\" [[caliber]] (.30 cal, 7.62 [[Millimeter|mm]]) rifle; Belgian designer [[L\u00e9on Nagant]] submitted a \"3.5-line\" (.35 caliber, 9&nbsp;mm) design; and a Captain Zinoviev submitted another \"3-line\" design (1 \"[[Line (length)|line]]\" = {{convert|1/10|in|2|disp=or|abbr=on}}, thus 3 lines= 7.62&nbsp;mm).\n\nWhen trials concluded in 1891, the evaluators were split in their assessment. The main disadvantages of Mosin's rifle were a more complicated mechanism and a long and tiresome procedure of disassembling (which required special instruments \u2014 it was necessary to unscrew two fasteners). Nagant's rifle was mainly criticized for its lower quality of manufacture and materials, due to \"artisan pre-production\" of his 300 rifles. The commission initially voted 14 to 10 to approve Mosin's rifle. At this point the decision was made to rename the existing commission and call it ''Commission for creation of the small-bore rifle'' ({{lang|ru|\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0436\u044c\u044f}}), and to put on paper the final requirements for such a rifle. The inventors obliged by delivering their final designs. Head of the commission, General Chagin, ordered subsequent tests held under the commission's supervision, after which the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered into production under the name of ''3-line rifle M1891'' ({{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0451\u0445\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 1891 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430}}).\n\n===Technical detail===\nLike the ''[[Gewehr 98]]'', the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs to lock up the action. However, the Mosin's lugs lock in the horizontal position, whereas the [[Mauser]] locks vertically. The Mosin bolt body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]]. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a \"controlled feed\" bolt head in which the cartridge base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a \"push feed\" recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as the bolt is finally closed similar to the ''[[Gewehr 1888]]'' and M91 [[Carcano]] or modern sporting rifles like the [[Remington 700]]. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a blade ejector mounted in the receiver. The Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully to the rear of the receiver and squeezing the trigger, while the Mauser has a bolt stop lever separate from the trigger.\n\nLike the Mauser, the bolt lift arc on the Mosin\u2013Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee\u2013Enfield. The Mauser bolt handle is at the rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear receiver ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the [[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer|Mannlicher]]: it is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to Mauser's \"third\" or \"safety\" lug.\n\nThe rifling of the Mosin barrel is right turning (clockwise looking down the rifle) 4-groove with a twist of 1:9.5\" or 1:10\". The 5-round fixed metallic [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] can either be loaded by inserting the cartridges singly, or more often in military service, by the use of 5-round [[stripper clip]]s.\n\n===Refinement and production===\n[[File:Rifles1905-2.jpg|thumb|left|Schematic of Model 1891 (top left)]]\nThe ''3-line rifle, Model 1891'', its original official designation, was adopted by the Russian military in 1891. There have been several variations from the original rifle, the most common being the M1891/30 (commonly referred to as \"the 91/30\" by shooters), which was a modernized design introduced in 1930. Some details were borrowed from Nagant's design. One such detail is the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin's original design the spring was not attached to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during cleaning. Another detail is the form of the [[stripper clip|clip]] that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine.\n\nAnother detail is the form of the \"interrupter\", a specially designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding.  The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle. Although the form of the interrupter was slightly changed, this alteration was subsequently borrowed back by the Commission for the Model 1891 Mosin\u2013Nagant. During the modernization of 1930, the form of the interrupter was further changed, from a single piece to a two-piece design, as the part had turned out to be one of the least reliable parts of the action. Only the clip loading cartridges and the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate in subsequent models were designed by Nagant. Considering the rifle could be easily loaded without using a clip, one cartridge after another, the magazine spring attached to the magazine base plate is the only contribution of Nagant to all rifles after 1930.\n\n===Nagant's legal dispute===\nDespite the failure of Nagant's rifle, he filed a patent suit, claiming he was entitled to the sum the winner was to receive. It appeared that Nagant was the first to apply for the international patent protection over the \"interrupter\", although he borrowed it from Mosin's design initially. Mosin could not apply for a patent since he was an officer of the Russian army, and the design of the rifle was owned by the Government and had the status of a military secret.\n\nA scandal was about to burst out, with Nagant threatening he would not participate in trials held in Russia ever again and some officials proposing to expel Nagant from any further trials as he borrowed the design of the \"interrupter\" after it was covered by the \"secrecy\" status given in Russia of that time to military inventions and therefore violated Russian law. Taking into consideration that Nagant was one of the few producers not engaged by competitive governments and generally eager to cooperate and share experience and technologies, the Commission paid him a sum of 200,000 Russian rubles, equal to the premium that Mosin received as the winner. The rifle did not receive the name of Mosin, because of the personal decision taken by [[Alexander III of Russia|Tzar Alexander III]], which was made based on the opinion of the Defence Minister [[Pyotr Vannovskiy]]: there are parts in this newly created design, invented by Colonel Rogovtzev, by Lt.-General Chagin's Commission, Captain Mosin and small-arms manufacturer Nagant, therefore it is only fair to call it ''Russian 3-line rifle M1891''.<ref name=eren20>{{harv|Erenfeicht|Konstankiewicz|2016|p=20}}</ref>\nThe Tzar himself dashed the word \"Russian\" from this document with his own hand.<ref name=eren20/> This turned out to be a wise decision, as Leon Nagant remained the major contractor for the Russian Government, and in [[Nagant M1895|1895, Nagant's revolver]] was adopted by the Russian army as the main sidearm.\n\nHowever, for the same reason and because of Nagant's attempts to use the situation for publicity, the \"Mosin\u2013Nagant\" name appeared in the Western literature (the rifle was never called this in Russia).<ref name=eren20/> The name is a misnomer from the legal point of view (taking into consideration the legal provisions of Russian law at that time, i.e. the law of the country to adopt the rifle) and from technical point of view, as none of the details borrowed from Nagant's design, even if removed, would prevent the rifle from firing. Moreover, from the technical point of view the rifle that came to be called \"Mosin\u2013Nagant\" (or \"Nagant\u2013Mosin\") is the design proposed by Mosin, as further amended by Mosin with some details being borrowed from Nagant's design. Only since 1924 the rifle was officially named the \"Mosin's rifle\" in the USSR, although peculiar models were still designated by a year only.<ref name=eren20/>\n\nProduction of the Model 1891 began in 1892 at the ordnance factories of [[Tula Arsenal]], [[Izhevsk Arsenal]] and at Sestroryetsk Arsenal. An order for 500,000 rifles was placed with the French arms factory, [[Manufacture d'armes de Ch\u00e2tellerault|Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Ch\u00e2tellerault]].<ref name=\"7.62x54r.net\">{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/Mosinprimer.htm |title=A Brief Overview of the Mosin Nagant Rifle |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Russo-Japanese War===\nIn 1889 Tsar Alexander III ordered the Russian army to meet or exceed European standards in rifle developments with \"rifles of reduced caliber and cartridges with smokeless powder.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Menning|1992|p=104}}</ref> The new weapons would entail ''high velocities'', exceeding 600 meters per second (2,000&nbsp;ft/s) and would result in land battles both commencing and being capable of being fought at longer ranges, nearly two kilometers.<ref name=\"Menning p. 105\">{{harvnb|Menning|1992|p=105}}</ref> The new Mosin rifles would replace the Berdan rifles then in use by the Russian army.\n\nThe [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905) was the Mosin\u2013Nagant M-1891{{#tag:ref|The name Mosin was not included in the rifle's description until after the Tsarist era (Lapin p. 81)|group=nb}} rifle's first major \"blooding\", and by the time the war broke out in 1904, approximately 3,800,000 Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891 rifles had been built,<ref>{{harvnb|Lapin|2003|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> with over a [[million]] and a half in the hands of the Russian [[cavalry]] and all of his reserves when hostilities commenced.<ref name=\"Menning p. 105\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kowner | first=Rotem |authorlink=Rotem Kowner |year=2006 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=0-8108-4927-5 |page=243}}</ref> However, few M-1891s saw combat in the conflict. Most{{cn|date=February 2020}} Russian units in the Far East were still armed with Berdan rifles.\n\nBetween the adoption of the final design in 1891 and the year 1910, several [[#Variants|variants]] and modifications to the existing rifles were made.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Defenders NGM-v31-p369-A.jpg|left|thumb|Russian Imperial infantry of World War I armed with Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], production was restricted to the M1891 dragoon and infantry models for the sake of simplicity. Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing [[Russian history, 1892\u20131917#Accelerated industrialization|domestic industry]], the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from [[Remington Arms]] and another 1.8 million from [[New England Westinghouse Company]] in the United States in 1915.<ref name=\"7.62x54r.net\"/> Remington produced 750,000 rifles before production was halted by the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. Deliveries to Russia had amounted to 469,951 rifles when the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ended hostilities between the [[Central Powers]] and Russia. Henceforth, the new Bolshevik regime of [[Vladimir Lenin]] cancelled payments to the American companies manufacturing the Mosin\u2013Nagant (Russia had not paid for the order at any time throughout the Great War).\n\nWith Remington and Westinghouse on the precipice of bankruptcy from the Communists' decision, the remaining 280,000 rifles were purchased by the [[United States Army]]. American and British expeditionary forces of the [[North Russia Campaign]] were armed with these rifles and sent to [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] in the late summer of 1918 to prevent the large quantities of munitions delivered for Czarist forces from being captured by the Central Powers. Remaining rifles were used for the training of U.S. Army troops. Some were used to equip U.S. National Guard, SATC, and ROTC units.<ref>Canfield, Bruce N. (July 2008). ''[[American Rifleman]]''. pp. 51\u201373.</ref> Designated \"U.S. Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916\", these are among the rarest of American service arms. In 1917, 50,000 rifles were sent via [[Vladivostok]] to the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in [[Siberia]] to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France.\n\nMany of the New England Westinghouse and Remington Mosin\u2013Nagants were sold to private citizens in the United States before World War II through the office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor to the federal government's current [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]].\n\nLarge numbers of Mosin\u2013Nagants were captured by [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces and saw service with the rear-echelon forces of both armies, and also with the [[Imperial German Navy]]. Many of these weapons were sold to Finland in the 1920s.\n\n===Civil War, modernization, and wars with Finland===\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]], infantry and dragoon versions were still in production, though in dramatically reduced numbers. The rifle was widely used by [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Black Guards]] and their enemies, the [[White movement|White Russians]] (counter-revolutionary forces). In 1924, following the victory of the [[Red Army]], a committee was established to modernize the rifle, which had by then been in service for over three decades. This effort led to the development of the Model 91/30 rifle, which was based on the design of the original dragoon version. The barrel length was shortened by {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The sight measurements were converted from [[Obsolete Russian units of measurement#Length|arshins]] to meters; and the front sight blade was replaced by a hooded post front sight less susceptible to being knocked out of alignment. There were also minor modifications to the bolt, but not enough to prevent interchangeability with the earlier Model 1891 and the so-called \"Cossack dragoon\" rifles.\n\nFinland was a Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until 1917, so Finns had long used the Mosin\u2013Nagant in service with the Tsarist military. The rifle was used in the short [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] there and adopted as the service rifle of the new republic's army. Finland produced several [[#Finland|variants]] of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, all of them manufactured using the receivers of Russian-made, American-made, French-made or (later) Soviet-made rifles. Finland also utilized a number of captured M91 and M91/30 rifles with minimal modifications. As a result, the rifle was used on both sides of the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] during World War II. Finnish Mosin\u2013Nagants were produced by [[SAKO]], Tikkakoski, and VKT, with some using barrels imported from Switzerland and Germany. In assembling M39 rifles, Finnish armorers re-used hexagonal receivers that dated back as far as 1891. Finnish rifles are characterized by Russian, French or American-made receivers stamped with a boxed SA, as well as many other parts produced in those countries and barrels produced in Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Germany. The Finns also manufactured two-piece \"finger splice\" stocks for their Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawles.to/Pre-1899_FAQ.html |title=The Pre-1899 Antique Guns FAQ |website=Rawles.to |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032921/http://www.rawles.to/Pre-1899_FAQ.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the rifle was distributed as aid to [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] anti-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRareSCWM9130s.htm |title=Spanish Civil War M91/30s |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128160530/http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRareSCWM9130s.htm |archivedate=28 January 2006 }}</ref> Spanish Civil War Mosins can be readily identified by the wire sling hangers inserted in the slots in the forearm and buttstock meant to take the Russian \"dog collars\" for Russian-style slings, so the rifles could accept Western European\u2013style rifle slings.\n\n===World War II===\nAt the beginning of the war, the Mosin\u2013Nagant 91/30 was the standard issue weapon of Soviet troops and millions of the rifles were produced and used in World War II by the largest mobilized army in history.\n\nThe Mosin\u2013Nagant Model 1891/30 was modified and adapted as a [[sniper rifle]] from 1932 onwards with mounts and scopes from Germany at first and subsequently with domestic designs (PE, PEM) and from 1942 was issued with [[PU scope|3.5-power PU fixed focus scopes]] to Soviet [[sniper]]s. It served quite prominently in the brutal [[Urban warfare|urban battles]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], which made heroes of snipers like [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaitsev]], [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] and [[Ivan Sidorenko]]. These sniper rifles were highly respected for being very rugged, reliable, accurate, and easy to maintain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Finland also employed the Mosin\u2013Nagant as a sniper rifle, with similar success with their own designs and captured Soviet rifles. For example, [[Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4]] is credited with having killed 505 Soviet soldiers, many of whom fell victim to his Finnish M/28-30 Mosin\u2013Nagant rifle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/simohayha.asp |title=Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224035052/http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/simohayha.asp |archivedate=24 February 2011 }}</ref> H\u00e4yh\u00e4 did not use a scope on his Mosin. In interviews H\u00e4yh\u00e4 gave before his death, he said that the scope and mount designed by the Soviets required the shooter to expose himself too much and raise his head too high, increasing the chances of being spotted by the enemy.\n\nIn 1935\u20131936, the 91/30 was again modified, this time to lower production time. The hex receiver (actually octagonal) was changed to a round receiver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinReceiver.htm |title=Mosin Nagant Rifle Receiver Variations |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> When war with Germany broke out, the need to produce Mosin\u2013Nagants in vast quantities led to a further simplification of machining and a falling-off in finish of the rifles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The wartime Mosins are easily identified by the presence of tool marks and rough finishing that never would have passed the inspectors in peacetime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} However, despite a lack of both aesthetic focus and uniformity, the basic functionality of the Mosins was unimpaired.\n\nIn addition, in 1938, a [[carbine]] version of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, the M38, was issued. The carbine used the same cartridge and action as other Mosins, but the barrel was shortened by {{convert|21.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} to bring the weapon down to an overall length of {{convert|101.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with the forearm shortened in proportion. The idea was to issue the M38 to troops such as [[combat engineer]]s, signal corps, and [[artillerymen]], who could conceivably need to defend themselves from sudden enemy advances, but whose primary duties lay behind the front lines. Significantly, the front sight of the M38 was positioned in such a way that the Model 91/30's cruciform bayonet could not be mounted to the muzzle even if a soldier obtained one.\n\nAn increase in urban combat led directly to the development of the Model M44 Mosin. In essence, the M44 is an M38 with a slightly modified forearm and with a permanently mounted cruciform bayonet that folds to the right when it is not needed. In terms of handiness, the M44 was an improvement on the Model 91/30, particularly for urban warfare; but few M44s saw combat on the Eastern Front.\n\nBy the end of the war, approximately 19.8 million  rifles had been produced.<ref>{{Cite book|title=When titans clashed : how the Red Army stopped Hitler|last=Glantz, David M., author.|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=9780700621200|location=|pages=306|oclc=910239607}}</ref>\n\n===Increased world-wide use===\nIn the years after World War II, the Soviet Union ceased production of all Mosin\u2013Nagants and withdrew them from service in favor of the [[SKS]] series carbines and eventually the [[AK-47|AK]] series rifles.  Despite its increasing obsolescence, the Mosin\u2013Nagant saw continued service throughout the Eastern bloc and the rest of the world for many decades to come. Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles and carbines saw service on many fronts of the [[Cold War]], from [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and along the [[Iron Curtain]] in Europe. They were kept not only as reserve stockpiles, but front-line infantry weapons as well.\n\nVirtually every country that received military aid from the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe during the Cold War used Mosin\u2013Nagants at various times.

It was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. Most Dragoon rifles were also converted to the M1891/30 standard. It was commonly used as a sniper rifle in [[World War II]]. Early sniper versions had a 4\u00d7 PE or PEM scope, a Soviet-made copy of a [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] design, while later rifles used smaller, simpler, and easier-to-produce 3.5\u00d7 [[PU scope]]s. Because the scope was mounted above the chamber, the bolt handle was replaced with a longer handled, bent version on sniper rifles (known to Mosin collectors and shooters as a \"bent bolt\") so the shooter could work the bolt without the scope interfering with it. Like the US [[M1903 Springfield|M1903A4 Springfield]] sniper rifle, the location of the scope above the receiver prevents the use of [[stripper clip]]s. Its design was based on the Dragoon rifle with the following modifications:\n** Flat rear sights and restamping of sights in metres, instead of [[Obsolete Russian units of measurement|arshinii]].\n** A cylindrical receiver, replacing the octagonal (commonly called \"hex\") receiver. Early production 91/30s (from 1930 to 1936) and converted Dragoon rifles retained the octagonal receiver.

The Model 24 was called the Lotta's Rifle (\"Lottakiv\u00e4\u00e4ri\") after the women's auxiliary of the Civil Guard, known as the [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] which was instrumental in raising funds to purchase and repair or refurbish some 10,000 rifles.<ref name=\"MN.net-M24\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp |title=The Finnish Civil Guards rifle-model of 1924 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010105057/http://mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp |archivedate=10 October 2011 }}</ref>\n* '''M/27'''{{Anchor|Finn M27}}: The Model 27 was the Finnish Army's first almost complete reworking of the Model 1891, it was nicknamed Pystykorva (literally \"[[spitz]]\") due to the foresight guards. The receiver and magazine of the 1891 were retained, but a new shorter-length heavy-weight barrel was fitted. The sights were modified. The receivers and bolts were modified with \"wings\" being fitted to the bolt connecting bars that fit into slots machined into the receivers. The stocks were initially produced by cutting down 1891 stocks and opening up the barrel channels to accommodate the heavier barrel. New barrel bands and nose caps were fitted and a new bayonet was issued. The modified stocks proved to be weak, breaking when soldiers practiced bayonet fighting or firing with the bayonet fitted. These and other problems resulted in a slow-down of production in the mid-1930s while solutions to problems were engineered and existing stocks of rifles were modified. Produced from mid-1927 to 1940, the Model 27 was the Finnish Army's main battle rifle in the Winter War.<ref name=\"MN.net-M27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/The-Finnish-M27.asp |title=The Finnish M27 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=11 June 2012  |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818121722/http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/The-Finnish-M27.asp |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}</ref>\n* '''M/27rv'''{{Anchor|Finn M27rv}}: A cavalry carbine version of the M27, rv is short for ratsuv\u00e4ki (literally mounted force). 2217 were made, and were assigned to the most elite Finnish cavalry units.

According to micrometer measurements and comparison to modern Lapua D46/47 bullet radar trajectory data, markings are matched to Finnish Lapua D46/D46 bullet surprisingly accurately through whole adjustment range between 150&nbsp;m and 2000&nbsp;m.\n:The trigger was also improved by adding coil spring to minimize very long pre-travel. Following M39 does not have this improvement. The magazine was also modified to prevent jamming. Magazines were stamped with \"HV\" (H\u00e4iri\u00f6 Vapaa = Jam Free) letters in right side of rifle. Later M39 uses identical design, but without \"HV\" -stamp. M/28-30 also have metal sleeve in fore-end of handguard, to reduce barrel harmonics change and to make barrel-stock contact more constant between shots and/or during environmental changes such as moisture and temperature. Later M39 does not have this upgrade.\n\n:In addition to its military usage, approximately 440 M/28-30 rifles were manufactured by SAKO for use in the [[ISSF World Shooting Championships#Interwar period|1937 World Shooting Championships]] in Helsinki.\n\n:M/28-30 model, serial number 60974, was also used by [[Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4]], a well-known [[Finnish people|Finnish]] sniper. M28/30 was used as Civil Guards competition rifle before World War II, as was the case with Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4's personal rifle. Therefore, rifles were built very well, with highest grade barrels available and carefully matched headspace. H\u00e4yh\u00e4's rifle was still at PKarPr (Northern Karelia Brigade) museum in 2002, then moved to an unknown place by the Finnish Army.<ref name=\"MN.net-M28-30\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/MosinNagant-M2830rifle-introduction.asp |title=The Finnish Model M28-30 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315092812/http://mosinnagant.net/finland/MosinNagant-M2830rifle-introduction.asp |archivedate=15 March 2011  }}</ref>\n* '''M/91-35''': A model proposed by the Finnish Army to replace both its M/27 and the White Guard's M/28 and M/28-30 rifles.

The M/39 also incorporated a semi-[[pistol grip]] into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin\u2013Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the [[Winter War]], but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the [[Continuation War]].

Few of these carbines exist, and the reason for their creation remains unclear. Like the M44, they have a bayonet groove cut into the right side of the stock, despite there being no evidence that the VZ91/38 design ever included a bayonet.  The front sight features a wide base similar to post World War II M44's.\n* '''VZ54 Sniper Rifle''': Based on the M1891/30, although it has the appearance of a modern sporting firearm. The VZ54 utilizes a Czech-made 2.5\u00d7 magnification scope, as well as a unique rear sight. It also borrows some features from the [[Mauser]] design, such as locking screws and a [[Karabiner 98k|K98k]]-style front sight hood.\n* '''VZ54/91 Sniper Rifle''': Updated version of the VZ54 Sniper Rifle. The VZ54/91 utilizes an adjustable biathlon style stock with fully adjustable comb and butt plate.  A rail beneath the forearm accepts adjustable sling swivels as well as a bipod. A Soviet manufactured PSO-1 scope also used on the SVD Dragunov sniper rifle is mounted on a side plate.  It retains the front and rear sights of the VZ54.\n\n===China===\n[[File:Chinese Type 53 carbine.jpg|thumb|A Chinese Type 53 carbine captured by US forces in Korea.]]\n* '''Type 53''': A license-built version of the post-war Soviet M1944 carbine. As many of the carbines imported to the United States are constructed of both local Chinese parts and surplus Soviet parts, there is much debate as to when this mixture occurred. Type 53s are found both with and without the permanently attached folding bayonet, though the former is far more common. The Chinese Type 53 carbine saw extensive service with the [[People's Liberation Army]] from 1953 until the late 1950s/early 1960s when the PLA went over to the [[SKS|Chinese Type 56 carbine]] and the [[Type 56 assault rifle|Chinese Type 56 assault rifle]]. Many Type 53 carbines were given to the People's Militia in China (The People's Militia used the Type 53 until 1982 when they were replaced with modern weapons. There is some evidence that the Type 53 carbine saw extensive use in the hands of the People's Militia during the years of the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]) and to [[North Vietnam]] (with many carbines ending up in the hands of the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] in [[South Vietnam]]) and to the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]] during the 1960s and 1970s. A significant number of Type 53 carbines were given to [[Albania]] and a few African countries as military aid by the Chinese during the 1960s.

Some collectors do not consider these safe to fire, but most appear to be in good working order although well worn and somewhat neglected. The \"EXERCITIU\" mark is found on rifles that seem to have been used specifically for training purposes only. The \"EXERCITIU\" rifles are easily recognized by the black paint on the entire butt of the stock. They are not intended to be fired since the firing pin is clipped and many times parts critical to their proper function are missing.\n\n===Poland===\n{{main|Karabinek wz. 91/98/23}}\n* '''wz. 91/98/23''': conversion to the 7.92mmx57 Mauser cartridge, with a magazine modified to feed rimless cartridges.

Produced from 1948 until 1960, the wz48 was used to train Czech and Polish military cadets.  It is chambered in .22 long rifle.\n\n===United States===\n* '''Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches)''': Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing domestic industry, the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from Remington Arms and another 1.8 million from New England Westinghouse in the United States. Some of these rifles were not delivered before the outbreak of the October Revolution and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] which ended hostilities between the Central Powers and Russia. When the Bolsheviks took over the Russian government, they defaulted on the Imperial Russian contracts with the American arsenals, with the result that New England Westinghouse and Remington were stuck with hundreds of thousands of Mosin\u2013Nagants. The US government bought up the remaining stocks, saving Remington and Westinghouse from bankruptcy. The rifles in Great Britain armed [[Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War|the US and British expeditionary forces]] sent to [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia in 1918 and 1919]]. The rifles still in the US ended up being primarily used as training firearms for the US Army. Some were used to equip [[US National Guard]], SATC and [[ROTC]] units. Collectors have taken to calling these rifles, \"U.S. Magazine Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916\", though no official source for this designation has ever been cited. Ordnance documents refer to the rifles as \"Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches)\".<ref>''Handbook of Ordnance Data'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1918, p.330.</ref>   In 1917, 50,000 of these rifles were sent via [[Vladivostok]] to equip the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in Siberia to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France. During the interwar period, the rifles which had been taken over by the US military were sold to private citizens in the United States by the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor agency to the current Civilian Marksmanship Program. They were sold for the sum of $3.00 each. If unaltered to chamber the US standard [[.30-06 Springfield]] rimless cartridge, these rifles are prized by collectors because they do not have the import marks required by law to be stamped or engraved on military surplus firearms brought into the United States from other countries.\n\n==Civilian use==\nMosin\u2013Nagants have been exported from Finland since the 1960s as its military modernized and decommissioned the rifles. Most of these have ended up as inexpensive surplus for Western nations.\n\nIn Russia the Mosin\u2013Nagant action has been used to produce a limited number of commercial rifles, the most famous are the Vostok brand target rifles exported in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s chambered in the standard 7.62\u00d754mmR round and in 6.5\u00d754mmR, a necked-down version of the original cartridge designed for long range target shooting. Rifles in 6.5\u00d754mmR use a necked-down 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge and were the standard rifle of the USSR's Olympic biathlon team until the International Olympic Committee revised the rules of the event to reduce the range to 50 meters and required all competitors to use rifles chambered in .22LR.\n\nA number of the Model 1891s produced by New England Westinghouse and Remington were sold to private citizens in the United States by the U.S. government through the Director of [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]] between the two World Wars. Rifles from this program are valuable collectibles. Many of these American-made Mosin\u2013Nagants were rechambered by wholesalers to the ubiquitous American [[.30-06 Springfield]] cartridge; some were done crudely, and others were professionally converted. Regardless of the conversion, a qualified gunsmith should examine the rifle before firing, and owners should use caution before firing commercial ammunition.\n\nWith the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]], a large quantity of Mosin\u2013Nagants have found their way onto markets outside of Russia as collectibles and hunting rifles. Due to the large surplus created by the Soviet small arms industry during World War II and the tendency of the former Soviet Union to retain and store large quantities of old but well-preserved surplus (long after other nations' militaries divested themselves of similar vintage materials), these rifles (mostly M1891/30 rifles and M1944 carbines) are inexpensive compared to other surplus arms of the same era.\n\nThere is serious collector interest in the Mosin\u2013Nagant family of rifles, and they are popular with hobby shooters and hunters. The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable for elevation, and is calibrated in hundreds of meters ([[Obsolete Russian units of measurement#Length|Arshins]] on earlier models). The front sight is a post that is not adjustable for elevation. Sight adjustment for windage was made by the armory before issue by drifting the sight left or right in its dovetail.\n\nThe limited sight adjustment leaves some hunters with the desire to add a scope, leading two companies to make adjustable sights for the Russian version of this rifle, Mojo and Smith-Sights. Several companies also make scope mounts for pistol scopes that can be mounted to the rear sight of the Model 91/30 without drilling or tapping.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49iG-i_Mi84 |title=How to Install a Scope on a 1891/30 Mosin Nagant by Removing Rear Sight for 52 Dollars |author=Cr Cook |date=11 June 2011 |website=YouTube |accessdate=8 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010236/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49iG-i_Mi84 |archivedate=11 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThey are capable of taking any game on the North American continent when correct ammunition is used.

It is one of the most mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history with over 37 million units having been made since its inception in 1891, and, in spite of its age, it has been used in various conflicts around the world up to the present day. It is primarily found chambered for its original [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].\n\n==History==\n===Initial design and tests===\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Ottoman War of 1877\u20131878]], Russian troops armed mostly with [[Berdan rifle|Berdan single-shot rifles]] suffered heavy casualties against [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops equipped with [[Winchester rifle|Winchester repeating rifles]], particularly at the bloody [[Siege of Pleven]]. This showed Russian commanders the need to modernize the general infantry weapon of the army.\n\nVarious weapons were acquired and tested by [[GRAU|GAU]] of the Ministry of Defense of Russian Empire, and in 1889 the [[Lebel M1886]] was obtained through semi-official channels from France. It was supplied together with a model of the cartridge and bullet but without the primer and the smokeless powder. Those problems were solved by Russian scientists and engineers (the smokeless powder, for instance, was produced by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] himself).\n\nIn 1889, three rifles were submitted for evaluation: Captain [[Sergei Ivanovich Mosin]] of the imperial army submitted his \"3-line\" [[caliber]] (.30 cal, 7.62 [[Millimeter|mm]]) rifle; Belgian designer [[L\u00e9on Nagant]] submitted a \"3.5-line\" (.35 caliber, 9&nbsp;mm) design; and a Captain Zinoviev submitted another \"3-line\" design (1 \"[[Line (length)|line]]\" = {{convert|1/10|in|2|disp=or|abbr=on}}, thus 3 lines= 7.62&nbsp;mm).\n\nWhen trials concluded in 1891, the evaluators were split in their assessment. The main disadvantages of Mosin's rifle were a more complicated mechanism and a long and tiresome procedure of disassembling (which required special instruments \u2014 it was necessary to unscrew two fasteners). Nagant's rifle was mainly criticized for its lower quality of manufacture and materials, due to \"artisan pre-production\" of his 300 rifles. The commission initially voted 14 to 10 to approve Mosin's rifle. At this point the decision was made to rename the existing commission and call it ''Commission for creation of the small-bore rifle'' ({{lang|ru|\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0436\u044c\u044f}}), and to put on paper the final requirements for such a rifle. The inventors obliged by delivering their final designs. Head of the commission, General Chagin, ordered subsequent tests held under the commission's supervision, after which the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered into production under the name of ''3-line rifle M1891'' ({{lang|ru|\u0442\u0440\u0451\u0445\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 1891 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430}}).\n\n===Technical detail===\nLike the ''[[Gewehr 98]]'', the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs to lock up the action. However, the Mosin's lugs lock in the horizontal position, whereas the [[Mauser]] locks vertically. The Mosin bolt body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]]. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a \"controlled feed\" bolt head in which the cartridge base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a \"push feed\" recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as the bolt is finally closed similar to the ''[[Gewehr 1888]]'' and M91 [[Carcano]] or modern sporting rifles like the [[Remington 700]]. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a blade ejector mounted in the receiver. The Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully to the rear of the receiver and squeezing the trigger, while the Mauser has a bolt stop lever separate from the trigger.\n\nLike the Mauser, the bolt lift arc on the Mosin\u2013Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee\u2013Enfield. The Mauser bolt handle is at the rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear receiver ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the [[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer|Mannlicher]]: it is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to Mauser's \"third\" or \"safety\" lug.\n\nThe rifling of the Mosin barrel is right turning (clockwise looking down the rifle) 4-groove with a twist of 1:9.5\" or 1:10\". The 5-round fixed metallic [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] can either be loaded by inserting the cartridges singly, or more often in military service, by the use of 5-round [[stripper clip]]s.\n\n===Refinement and production===\n[[File:Rifles1905-2.jpg|thumb|left|Schematic of Model 1891 (top left)]]\nThe ''3-line rifle, Model 1891'', its original official designation, was adopted by the Russian military in 1891. There have been several variations from the original rifle, the most common being the M1891/30 (commonly referred to as \"the 91/30\" by shooters), which was a modernized design introduced in 1930. Some details were borrowed from Nagant's design. One such detail is the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin's original design the spring was not attached to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during cleaning. Another detail is the form of the [[stripper clip|clip]] that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine.\n\nAnother detail is the form of the \"interrupter\", a specially designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding.  The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle. Although the form of the interrupter was slightly changed, this alteration was subsequently borrowed back by the Commission for the Model 1891 Mosin\u2013Nagant. During the modernization of 1930, the form of the interrupter was further changed, from a single piece to a two-piece design, as the part had turned out to be one of the least reliable parts of the action. Only the clip loading cartridges and the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate in subsequent models were designed by Nagant. Considering the rifle could be easily loaded without using a clip, one cartridge after another, the magazine spring attached to the magazine base plate is the only contribution of Nagant to all rifles after 1930.\n\n===Nagant's legal dispute===\nDespite the failure of Nagant's rifle, he filed a patent suit, claiming he was entitled to the sum the winner was to receive. It appeared that Nagant was the first to apply for the international patent protection over the \"interrupter\", although he borrowed it from Mosin's design initially. Mosin could not apply for a patent since he was an officer of the Russian army, and the design of the rifle was owned by the Government and had the status of a military secret.\n\nA scandal was about to burst out, with Nagant threatening he would not participate in trials held in Russia ever again and some officials proposing to expel Nagant from any further trials as he borrowed the design of the \"interrupter\" after it was covered by the \"secrecy\" status given in Russia of that time to military inventions and therefore violated Russian law. Taking into consideration that Nagant was one of the few producers not engaged by competitive governments and generally eager to cooperate and share experience and technologies, the Commission paid him a sum of 200,000 Russian rubles, equal to the premium that Mosin received as the winner. The rifle did not receive the name of Mosin, because of the personal decision taken by [[Alexander III of Russia|Tzar Alexander III]], which was made based on the opinion of the Defence Minister [[Pyotr Vannovskiy]]: there are parts in this newly created design, invented by Colonel Rogovtzev, by Lt.-General Chagin's Commission, Captain Mosin and small-arms manufacturer Nagant, therefore it is only fair to call it ''Russian 3-line rifle M1891''.<ref name=eren20>{{harv|Erenfeicht|Konstankiewicz|2016|p=20}}</ref>\nThe Tzar himself dashed the word \"Russian\" from this document with his own hand.<ref name=eren20/> This turned out to be a wise decision, as Leon Nagant remained the major contractor for the Russian Government, and in [[Nagant M1895|1895, Nagant's revolver]] was adopted by the Russian army as the main sidearm.\n\nHowever, for the same reason and because of Nagant's attempts to use the situation for publicity, the \"Mosin\u2013Nagant\" name appeared in the Western literature (the rifle was never called this in Russia).<ref name=eren20/> The name is a misnomer from the legal point of view (taking into consideration the legal provisions of Russian law at that time, i.e. the law of the country to adopt the rifle) and from technical point of view, as none of the details borrowed from Nagant's design, even if removed, would prevent the rifle from firing. Moreover, from the technical point of view the rifle that came to be called \"Mosin\u2013Nagant\" (or \"Nagant\u2013Mosin\") is the design proposed by Mosin, as further amended by Mosin with some details being borrowed from Nagant's design. Only since 1924 the rifle was officially named the \"Mosin's rifle\" in the USSR, although peculiar models were still designated by a year only.<ref name=eren20/>\n\nProduction of the Model 1891 began in 1892 at the ordnance factories of [[Tula Arsenal]], [[Izhevsk Arsenal]] and at Sestroryetsk Arsenal. An order for 500,000 rifles was placed with the French arms factory, [[Manufacture d'armes de Ch\u00e2tellerault|Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Ch\u00e2tellerault]].<ref name=\"7.62x54r.net\">{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/Mosinprimer.htm |title=A Brief Overview of the Mosin Nagant Rifle |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Russo-Japanese War===\nIn 1889 Tsar Alexander III ordered the Russian army to meet or exceed European standards in rifle developments with \"rifles of reduced caliber and cartridges with smokeless powder.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Menning|1992|p=104}}</ref> The new weapons would entail ''high velocities'', exceeding 600 meters per second (2,000&nbsp;ft/s) and would result in land battles both commencing and being capable of being fought at longer ranges, nearly two kilometers.<ref name=\"Menning p. 105\">{{harvnb|Menning|1992|p=105}}</ref> The new Mosin rifles would replace the Berdan rifles then in use by the Russian army.\n\nThe [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905) was the Mosin\u2013Nagant M-1891{{#tag:ref|The name Mosin was not included in the rifle's description until after the Tsarist era (Lapin p. 81)|group=nb}} rifle's first major \"blooding\", and by the time the war broke out in 1904, approximately 3,800,000 Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891 rifles had been built,<ref>{{harvnb|Lapin|2003|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> with over a [[million]] and a half in the hands of the Russian [[cavalry]] and all of his reserves when hostilities commenced.<ref name=\"Menning p. 105\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kowner | first=Rotem |authorlink=Rotem Kowner |year=2006 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=0-8108-4927-5 |page=243}}</ref> However, few M-1891s saw combat in the conflict. Most{{cn|date=February 2020}} Russian units in the Far East were still armed with Berdan rifles.\n\nBetween the adoption of the final design in 1891 and the year 1910, several [[#Variants|variants]] and modifications to the existing rifles were made.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Defenders NGM-v31-p369-A.jpg|left|thumb|Russian Imperial infantry of World War I armed with Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], production was restricted to the M1891 dragoon and infantry models for the sake of simplicity. Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing [[Russian history, 1892\u20131917#Accelerated industrialization|domestic industry]], the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from [[Remington Arms]] and another 1.8 million from [[New England Westinghouse Company]] in the United States in 1915.<ref name=\"7.62x54r.net\"/> Remington produced 750,000 rifles before production was halted by the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. Deliveries to Russia had amounted to 469,951 rifles when the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ended hostilities between the [[Central Powers]] and Russia. Henceforth, the new Bolshevik regime of [[Vladimir Lenin]] cancelled payments to the American companies manufacturing the Mosin\u2013Nagant (Russia had not paid for the order at any time throughout the Great War).\n\nWith Remington and Westinghouse on the precipice of bankruptcy from the Communists' decision, the remaining 280,000 rifles were purchased by the [[United States Army]]. American and British expeditionary forces of the [[North Russia Campaign]] were armed with these rifles and sent to [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] in the late summer of 1918 to prevent the large quantities of munitions delivered for Czarist forces from being captured by the Central Powers. Remaining rifles were used for the training of U.S. Army troops. Some were used to equip U.S. National Guard, SATC, and ROTC units.<ref>Canfield, Bruce N. (July 2008). ''[[American Rifleman]]''. pp. 51\u201373.</ref> Designated \"U.S. Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916\", these are among the rarest of American service arms. In 1917, 50,000 rifles were sent via [[Vladivostok]] to the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in [[Siberia]] to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France.\n\nMany of the New England Westinghouse and Remington Mosin\u2013Nagants were sold to private citizens in the United States before World War II through the office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor to the federal government's current [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]].\n\nLarge numbers of Mosin\u2013Nagants were captured by [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces and saw service with the rear-echelon forces of both armies, and also with the [[Imperial German Navy]]. Many of these weapons were sold to Finland in the 1920s.\n\n===Civil War, modernization, and wars with Finland===\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]], infantry and dragoon versions were still in production, though in dramatically reduced numbers. The rifle was widely used by [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Black Guards]] and their enemies, the [[White movement|White Russians]] (counter-revolutionary forces). In 1924, following the victory of the [[Red Army]], a committee was established to modernize the rifle, which had by then been in service for over three decades. This effort led to the development of the Model 91/30 rifle, which was based on the design of the original dragoon version. The barrel length was shortened by {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The sight measurements were converted from [[Obsolete Russian units of measurement#Length|arshins]] to meters; and the front sight blade was replaced by a hooded post front sight less susceptible to being knocked out of alignment. There were also minor modifications to the bolt, but not enough to prevent interchangeability with the earlier Model 1891 and the so-called \"Cossack dragoon\" rifles.\n\nFinland was a Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until 1917, so Finns had long used the Mosin\u2013Nagant in service with the Tsarist military. The rifle was used in the short [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] there and adopted as the service rifle of the new republic's army. Finland produced several [[#Finland|variants]] of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, all of them manufactured using the receivers of Russian-made, American-made, French-made or (later) Soviet-made rifles. Finland also utilized a number of captured M91 and M91/30 rifles with minimal modifications. As a result, the rifle was used on both sides of the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] during World War II. Finnish Mosin\u2013Nagants were produced by [[SAKO]], Tikkakoski, and VKT, with some using barrels imported from Switzerland and Germany. In assembling M39 rifles, Finnish armorers re-used hexagonal receivers that dated back as far as 1891. Finnish rifles are characterized by Russian, French or American-made receivers stamped with a boxed SA, as well as many other parts produced in those countries and barrels produced in Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Germany. The Finns also manufactured two-piece \"finger splice\" stocks for their Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawles.to/Pre-1899_FAQ.html |title=The Pre-1899 Antique Guns FAQ |website=Rawles.to |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032921/http://www.rawles.to/Pre-1899_FAQ.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the rifle was distributed as aid to [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] anti-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRareSCWM9130s.htm |title=Spanish Civil War M91/30s |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128160530/http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRareSCWM9130s.htm |archivedate=28 January 2006 }}</ref> Spanish Civil War Mosins can be readily identified by the wire sling hangers inserted in the slots in the forearm and buttstock meant to take the Russian \"dog collars\" for Russian-style slings, so the rifles could accept Western European\u2013style rifle slings.\n\n===World War II===\nAt the beginning of the war, the Mosin\u2013Nagant 91/30 was the standard issue weapon of Soviet troops and millions of the rifles were produced and used in World War II by the largest mobilized army in history.\n\nThe Mosin\u2013Nagant Model 1891/30 was modified and adapted as a [[sniper rifle]] from 1932 onwards with mounts and scopes from Germany at first and subsequently with domestic designs (PE, PEM) and from 1942 was issued with [[PU scope|3.5-power PU fixed focus scopes]] to Soviet [[sniper]]s. It served quite prominently in the brutal [[Urban warfare|urban battles]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], which made heroes of snipers like [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaitsev]], [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] and [[Ivan Sidorenko]]. These sniper rifles were highly respected for being very rugged, reliable, accurate, and easy to maintain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Finland also employed the Mosin\u2013Nagant as a sniper rifle, with similar success with their own designs and captured Soviet rifles. For example, [[Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4]] is credited with having killed 505 Soviet soldiers, many of whom fell victim to his Finnish M/28-30 Mosin\u2013Nagant rifle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/simohayha.asp |title=Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224035052/http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/simohayha.asp |archivedate=24 February 2011 }}</ref> H\u00e4yh\u00e4 did not use a scope on his Mosin. In interviews H\u00e4yh\u00e4 gave before his death, he said that the scope and mount designed by the Soviets required the shooter to expose himself too much and raise his head too high, increasing the chances of being spotted by the enemy.\n\nIn 1935\u20131936, the 91/30 was again modified, this time to lower production time. The hex receiver (actually octagonal) was changed to a round receiver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinReceiver.htm |title=Mosin Nagant Rifle Receiver Variations |website=7.62x54r.net |accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> When war with Germany broke out, the need to produce Mosin\u2013Nagants in vast quantities led to a further simplification of machining and a falling-off in finish of the rifles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The wartime Mosins are easily identified by the presence of tool marks and rough finishing that never would have passed the inspectors in peacetime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} However, despite a lack of both aesthetic focus and uniformity, the basic functionality of the Mosins was unimpaired.\n\nIn addition, in 1938, a [[carbine]] version of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, the M38, was issued. The carbine used the same cartridge and action as other Mosins, but the barrel was shortened by {{convert|21.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} to bring the weapon down to an overall length of {{convert|101.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with the forearm shortened in proportion. The idea was to issue the M38 to troops such as [[combat engineer]]s, signal corps, and [[artillerymen]], who could conceivably need to defend themselves from sudden enemy advances, but whose primary duties lay behind the front lines. Significantly, the front sight of the M38 was positioned in such a way that the Model 91/30's cruciform bayonet could not be mounted to the muzzle even if a soldier obtained one.\n\nAn increase in urban combat led directly to the development of the Model M44 Mosin. In essence, the M44 is an M38 with a slightly modified forearm and with a permanently mounted cruciform bayonet that folds to the right when it is not needed. In terms of handiness, the M44 was an improvement on the Model 91/30, particularly for urban warfare; but few M44s saw combat on the Eastern Front.\n\nBy the end of the war, approximately 19.8 million  rifles had been produced.<ref>{{Cite book|title=When titans clashed : how the Red Army stopped Hitler|last=Glantz, David M., author.|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=9780700621200|location=|pages=306|oclc=910239607}}</ref>\n\n===Increased world-wide use===\nIn the years after World War II, the Soviet Union ceased production of all Mosin\u2013Nagants and withdrew them from service in favor of the [[SKS]] series carbines and eventually the [[AK-47|AK]] series rifles.  Despite its increasing obsolescence, the Mosin\u2013Nagant saw continued service throughout the Eastern bloc and the rest of the world for many decades to come. Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles and carbines saw service on many fronts of the [[Cold War]], from [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and along the [[Iron Curtain]] in Europe. They were kept not only as reserve stockpiles, but front-line infantry weapons as well.\n\nVirtually every country that received military aid from the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe during the Cold War used Mosin\u2013Nagants at various times.

It was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. Most Dragoon rifles were also converted to the M1891/30 standard. It was commonly used as a sniper rifle in [[World War II]]. Early sniper versions had a 4\u00d7 PE or PEM scope, a Soviet-made copy of a [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] design, while later rifles used smaller, simpler, and easier-to-produce 3.5\u00d7 [[PU scope]]s. Because the scope was mounted above the chamber, the bolt handle was replaced with a longer handled, bent version on sniper rifles (known to Mosin collectors and shooters as a \"bent bolt\") so the shooter could work the bolt without the scope interfering with it. Like the US [[M1903 Springfield|M1903A4 Springfield]] sniper rifle, the location of the scope above the receiver prevents the use of [[stripper clip]]s. Its design was based on the Dragoon rifle with the following modifications:\n** Flat rear sights and restamping of sights in metres, instead of [[Obsolete Russian units of measurement|arshinii]].\n** A cylindrical receiver, replacing the octagonal (commonly called \"hex\") receiver.

A subsequent contract for 5,000 additional heavier barrels, stepped at the muzzle end to accept the standard Mosin\u2013Nagant bayonet, was let the next year. The German contracts, starting in 1924 and running to 1926, were all for the heavier, stepped barrels with two contracts: one for 5,000 barrels and a second for 8,000 barrels. The German-made barrels are marked \"Bohler-Stahl\" on the under side of the chamber. All Model 24s are marked with the Civil Guard logo of three fir tree sprigs over a capital \"S.\"  All Model 24s are equipped with a coil spring around the trigger pin to improve the trigger pull and thus the accuracy of the rifle. The Model 24 was called the Lotta's Rifle (\"Lottakiv\u00e4\u00e4ri\") after the women's auxiliary of the Civil Guard, known as the [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] which was instrumental in raising funds to purchase and repair or refurbish some 10,000 rifles.<ref name=\"MN.net-M24\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp |title=The Finnish Civil Guards rifle-model of 1924 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010105057/http://mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp |archivedate=10 October 2011 }}</ref>\n* '''M/27'''{{Anchor|Finn M27}}: The Model 27 was the Finnish Army's first almost complete reworking of the Model 1891, it was nicknamed Pystykorva (literally \"[[spitz]]\") due to the foresight guards. The receiver and magazine of the 1891 were retained, but a new shorter-length heavy-weight barrel was fitted. The sights were modified. The receivers and bolts were modified with \"wings\" being fitted to the bolt connecting bars that fit into slots machined into the receivers. The stocks were initially produced by cutting down 1891 stocks and opening up the barrel channels to accommodate the heavier barrel. New barrel bands and nose caps were fitted and a new bayonet was issued. The modified stocks proved to be weak, breaking when soldiers practiced bayonet fighting or firing with the bayonet fitted. These and other problems resulted in a slow-down of production in the mid-1930s while solutions to problems were engineered and existing stocks of rifles were modified. Produced from mid-1927 to 1940, the Model 27 was the Finnish Army's main battle rifle in the Winter War.<ref name=\"MN.net-M27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/The-Finnish-M27.asp |title=The Finnish M27 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=11 June 2012  |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818121722/http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/The-Finnish-M27.asp |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}</ref>\n* '''M/27rv'''{{Anchor|Finn M27rv}}: A cavalry carbine version of the M27, rv is short for ratsuv\u00e4ki (literally mounted force). 2217 were made, and were assigned to the most elite Finnish cavalry units.

According to micrometer measurements and comparison to modern Lapua D46/47 bullet radar trajectory data, markings are matched to Finnish Lapua D46/D46 bullet surprisingly accurately through whole adjustment range between 150&nbsp;m and 2000&nbsp;m.\n:The trigger was also improved by adding coil spring to minimize very long pre-travel. Following M39 does not have this improvement. The magazine was also modified to prevent jamming. Magazines were stamped with \"HV\" (H\u00e4iri\u00f6 Vapaa = Jam Free) letters in right side of rifle. Later M39 uses identical design, but without \"HV\" -stamp. M/28-30 also have metal sleeve in fore-end of handguard, to reduce barrel harmonics change and to make barrel-stock contact more constant between shots and/or during environmental changes such as moisture and temperature. Later M39 does not have this upgrade.\n\n:In addition to its military usage, approximately 440 M/28-30 rifles were manufactured by SAKO for use in the [[ISSF World Shooting Championships#Interwar period|1937 World Shooting Championships]] in Helsinki.\n\n:M/28-30 model, serial number 60974, was also used by [[Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4]], a well-known [[Finnish people|Finnish]] sniper. M28/30 was used as Civil Guards competition rifle before World War II, as was the case with Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4's personal rifle. Therefore, rifles were built very well, with highest grade barrels available and carefully matched headspace. H\u00e4yh\u00e4's rifle was still at PKarPr (Northern Karelia Brigade) museum in 2002, then moved to an unknown place by the Finnish Army.<ref name=\"MN.net-M28-30\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/MosinNagant-M2830rifle-introduction.asp |title=The Finnish Model M28-30 |website=Mosin-Nagant.net  |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315092812/http://mosinnagant.net/finland/MosinNagant-M2830rifle-introduction.asp |archivedate=15 March 2011  }}</ref>\n* '''M/91-35''': A model proposed by the Finnish Army to replace both its M/27 and the White Guard's M/28 and M/28-30 rifles.

The M/39 was derived largely from the M28-30, but included some alterations proposed by the Army. The M/39 also incorporated a semi-[[pistol grip]] into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin\u2013Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the [[Winter War]], but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the [[Continuation War]]. Small numbers were assembled from leftover parts in the late 1960s through 1970, bringing the total production to approximately 102,000.\n* '''M/30'''{{Anchor|Finn M30}}: Tikkakoski produced improved, high-quality Model 1891/30 rifles in 1943 and 1944, designated M/30, using new barrels and parts from some of the almost 125,000 1891/30s captured in the Winter and Continuation Wars as well as 57,000 rifles bought from the Germans in 1944 (most of which were only suitable for use as parts donors).

Few of these carbines exist, and the reason for their creation remains unclear. Like the M44, they have a bayonet groove cut into the right side of the stock, despite there being no evidence that the VZ91/38 design ever included a bayonet.  The front sight features a wide base similar to post World War II M44's.\n* '''VZ54 Sniper Rifle''': Based on the M1891/30, although it has the appearance of a modern sporting firearm. The VZ54 utilizes a Czech-made 2.5\u00d7 magnification scope, as well as a unique rear sight. It also borrows some features from the [[Mauser]] design, such as locking screws and a [[Karabiner 98k|K98k]]-style front sight hood.\n* '''VZ54/91 Sniper Rifle''': Updated version of the VZ54 Sniper Rifle. The VZ54/91 utilizes an adjustable biathlon style stock with fully adjustable comb and butt plate.  A rail beneath the forearm accepts adjustable sling swivels as well as a bipod. A Soviet manufactured PSO-1 scope also used on the SVD Dragunov sniper rifle is mounted on a side plate.  It retains the front and rear sights of the VZ54.\n\n===China===\n[[File:Chinese Type 53 carbine.jpg|thumb|A Chinese Type 53 carbine captured by US forces in Korea.]]\n* '''Type 53''': A license-built version of the post-war Soviet M1944 carbine. As many of the carbines imported to the United States are constructed of both local Chinese parts and surplus Soviet parts, there is much debate as to when this mixture occurred. Type 53s are found both with and without the permanently attached folding bayonet, though the former is far more common. The Chinese Type 53 carbine saw extensive service with the [[People's Liberation Army]] from 1953 until the late 1950s/early 1960s when the PLA went over to the [[SKS|Chinese Type 56 carbine]] and the [[Type 56 assault rifle|Chinese Type 56 assault rifle]]. Many Type 53 carbines were given to the People's Militia in China (The People's Militia used the Type 53 until 1982 when they were replaced with modern weapons. There is some evidence that the Type 53 carbine saw extensive use in the hands of the People's Militia during the years of the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]) and to [[North Vietnam]] (with many carbines ending up in the hands of the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] in [[South Vietnam]]) and to the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]] during the 1960s and 1970s. A significant number of Type 53 carbines were given to [[Albania]] and a few African countries as military aid by the Chinese during the 1960s.

Some collectors do not consider these safe to fire, but most appear to be in good working order although well worn and somewhat neglected. The \"EXERCITIU\" mark is found on rifles that seem to have been used specifically for training purposes only. The \"EXERCITIU\" rifles are easily recognized by the black paint on the entire butt of the stock. They are not intended to be fired since the firing pin is clipped and many times parts critical to their proper function are missing.\n\n===Poland===\n{{main|Karabinek wz. 91/98/23}}\n* '''wz. 91/98/23''': conversion to the 7.92mmx57 Mauser cartridge, with a magazine modified to feed rimless cartridges.

Produced from 1948 until 1960, the wz48 was used to train Czech and Polish military cadets.  It is chambered in .22 long rifle.\n\n===United States===\n* '''Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches)''': Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing domestic industry, the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from Remington Arms and another 1.8 million from New England Westinghouse in the United States. Some of these rifles were not delivered before the outbreak of the October Revolution and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] which ended hostilities between the Central Powers and Russia. When the Bolsheviks took over the Russian government, they defaulted on the Imperial Russian contracts with the American arsenals, with the result that New England Westinghouse and Remington were stuck with hundreds of thousands of Mosin\u2013Nagants. The US government bought up the remaining stocks, saving Remington and Westinghouse from bankruptcy. The rifles in Great Britain armed [[Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War|the US and British expeditionary forces]] sent to [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia in 1918 and 1919]]. The rifles still in the US ended up being primarily used as training firearms for the US Army. Some were used to equip [[US National Guard]], SATC and [[ROTC]] units. Collectors have taken to calling these rifles, \"U.S. Magazine Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916\", though no official source for this designation has ever been cited. Ordnance documents refer to the rifles as \"Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches)\".<ref>''Handbook of Ordnance Data'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1918, p.330.</ref>   In 1917, 50,000 of these rifles were sent via [[Vladivostok]] to equip the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in Siberia to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France. During the interwar period, the rifles which had been taken over by the US military were sold to private citizens in the United States by the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor agency to the current Civilian Marksmanship Program. They were sold for the sum of $3.00 each. If unaltered to chamber the US standard [[.30-06 Springfield]] rimless cartridge, these rifles are prized by collectors because they do not have the import marks required by law to be stamped or engraved on military surplus firearms brought into the United States from other countries.\n\n==Civilian use==\nMosin\u2013Nagants have been exported from Finland since the 1960s as its military modernized and decommissioned the rifles. Most of these have ended up as inexpensive surplus for Western nations.\n\nIn Russia the Mosin\u2013Nagant action has been used to produce a limited number of commercial rifles, the most famous are the Vostok brand target rifles exported in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s chambered in the standard 7.62\u00d754mmR round and in 6.5\u00d754mmR, a necked-down version of the original cartridge designed for long range target shooting. Rifles in 6.5\u00d754mmR use a necked-down 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge and were the standard rifle of the USSR's Olympic biathlon team until the International Olympic Committee revised the rules of the event to reduce the range to 50 meters and required all competitors to use rifles chambered in .22LR.\n\nA number of the Model 1891s produced by New England Westinghouse and Remington were sold to private citizens in the United States by the U.S. government through the Director of [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]] between the two World Wars. Rifles from this program are valuable collectibles. Many of these American-made Mosin\u2013Nagants were rechambered by wholesalers to the ubiquitous American [[.30-06 Springfield]] cartridge; some were done crudely, and others were professionally converted. Regardless of the conversion, a qualified gunsmith should examine the rifle before firing, and owners should use caution before firing commercial ammunition.\n\nWith the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]], a large quantity of Mosin\u2013Nagants have found their way onto markets outside of Russia as collectibles and hunting rifles. Due to the large surplus created by the Soviet small arms industry during World War II and the tendency of the former Soviet Union to retain and store large quantities of old but well-preserved surplus (long after other nations' militaries divested themselves of similar vintage materials), these rifles (mostly M1891/30 rifles and M1944 carbines) are inexpensive compared to other surplus arms of the same era.\n\nThere is serious collector interest in the Mosin\u2013Nagant family of rifles, and they are popular with hobby shooters and hunters. The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable for elevation, and is calibrated in hundreds of meters ([[Obsolete Russian units of measurement#Length|Arshins]] on earlier models). The front sight is a post that is not adjustable for elevation. Sight adjustment for windage was made by the armory before issue by drifting the sight left or right in its dovetail.\n\nThe limited sight adjustment leaves some hunters with the desire to add a scope, leading two companies to make adjustable sights for the Russian version of this rifle, Mojo and Smith-Sights. Several companies also make scope mounts for pistol scopes that can be mounted to the rear sight of the Model 91/30 without drilling or tapping.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49iG-i_Mi84 |title=How to Install a Scope on a 1891/30 Mosin Nagant by Removing Rear Sight for 52 Dollars |author=Cr Cook |date=11 June 2011 |website=YouTube |accessdate=8 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010236/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49iG-i_Mi84 |archivedate=11 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThey are capable of taking any game on the North American continent when correct ammunition is used.

The process involves folding [[carton]] made of [[paperboard]] that is printed, [[laminate]]d, cut, then folded and glued before transport to packagers. The cartons are shipped flat to a packager, which has its own machinery to fold the carton into its final shape as a container for a product.

Although [[Charles Henry Foyle]] is described by some as the \"inventor\" of the paper carton, [[mass production]] of the cartons was invented, partly by accident, at the [[Robert Gair]] Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Machinery at the end of the press had been set up carelessly by a pressman, and machinery cut through the material. This ruined the press but gave them an idea: printing and cutting could be done with one machine. Previously, cutting of printed cardboard had been done manually. From the mistake in 1879, Gair developed a process for mass production of boxes. In 1897, the National Biscuit Company ([[Nabisco]]) became the first large company to adopt the new cartons, for [[Uneeda Biscuits]]. Other manufacturers soon followed. With inexpensive packaging now even common items could be placed in a showy carton and each carton became its own advertisement. The product was also protected, and the contents had a longer [[shelf life]]. This trend was to continue with force, through the 20th century. This could be seen as a contributing factor in the so-called '[[Throw-away society|throwaway]]' culture of America. The environmental impact of product packaging has gained attention from consumers and businesses alike, and this awareness has created a steady trend since the mid to late 1990s, on the part of manufacturers, to use recycled material and/or reduce overall materials usage.\n\n==Product characteristics==\nFolding cartons are now an $80 billion industry.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Typically, cylinder board made from pulp from reprocessed [[scrap paper]] is used for most packages.
