In 1999 the administration of the province was handed on an interim basis to the [[United Nations]] under the terms of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UNSCR 1244]] which ended the Kosovo conflict of that year. That resolution reaffirmed the sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo but required the [[UNMIK|UN administration]] to promote the establishment of 'substantial autonomy and self-government' for Kosovo pending a 'final settlement' for negotiation between the parties.\n\nThe UN-sponsored talks began in February 2006, and though no agreement was reached between the parties, a proposal from UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]] was presented in May 2007 which recommended 'supervised independence' for the province. After many weeks of discussions at the UN in New York, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing.<ref name=\"news.yahoo.com\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623201334/http://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo |archivedate=23 June 2009 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}\n\nOn 17 February 2008 representatives of the people of [[Kosovo]], [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence#ICJ ruling|acting outside]] the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]'s [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|PISG]] framework issued a [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] establishing the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peace.ax/en/bloggen/1286-icj-delivers-advisory-opinion-on-the-accordance-with-international-law-of-the-unilateral-declaration-of-independence-in-respect-of-kosovo-en |title=ICJ delivers advisory opinion on the accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo |website=Peace.ax |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]] ruled that the declaration did not violate international law and argued that the signatory authors represented the broad will of the People of Kosovo, rather than the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] under the umbrella of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |title=ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN RESPECT OF KOSOVO |website=Icj-cij.org |accessdate=2016-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821055950/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |archivedate=21 August 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of Kosovo}}\n\n===Status in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\n{{main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\n[[File:Banovine Jugoslavia.png|thumb|250px|right|Map showing banovinas in 1929]]\n\nFollowing the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912\u201313) and the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaties of London]] and [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|Bucharest]], which led to the Ottoman loss of most of the Balkans, Kosovo was governed as an integral part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], while its western part ([[Metohija]]) by the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].

Their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups or to pre-World War I state borders.

It also promoted the [[Vardar Macedonia|Vardar region]] of southern Serbia to the status of a separate republic, the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]]. The constitution, adopted on 31 January 1946, stated that \"The People's Republic of Serbia includes the autonomous province of Vojvodina and the autonomous Kosovo-Metohijan region.\" It did not spell out the rights and scope of the autonomous provinces, instead stating that this was a matter to be \"determined by the constitution of the [parent] republic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1946.txt |format=TXT |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERATIVE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (1946) |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe later Constitution of the SFRY, adopted on 7 April 1963, again provided for republics to \"found autonomous provinces in accordance with the constitution in areas with distinctive national characteristics or in areas with other distinguishing features, on the basis of the express will of the population of this area.\" Within the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], \"there are the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija, established in 1945 by the decision of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia in accordance with the express will of the population of these areas.\" The details of the rights and scope of the provinces was, again, reserved to the republics' constitutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1963.doc |format=DOC |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, at the time the world's longest, greatly changed the constitutional setup within Yugoslavia. It increased the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and gave both autonomous provinces ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments as changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies. It also granted equal status to the Serbian, Albanian and Turkish languages and alphabets within Kosovo.\n\nThis created anomalous situation sometimes said to be unique in world history, in which any of the provinces of Serbia could veto a decision pertaining to entire Serbia, while the parliament of Serbia could not influence decisions of the provincial parliaments. This led to central Serbia, which was not a political unit, is effectively under the control of the provinces.\n\nThe 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War [the Second World War] and socialist revolution....\" The separately promulgated Constitution of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo declared that:\n\n{{cquote|The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is an autonomous, socialist, democratic, socio-political and self-managing community of working people and citizens, equal Albanians, Montenegrins, Muslims, Serbs, Turks, and members of other nations and nationalities and ethnic groups, based on the power of and self-management by the working class and all working people. The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.}}\n\nThe expansion of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became a rallying cry for a new generation of Serbian politicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]], who became [[President of Serbia]], urged the other republics to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy.\n\nStamboli\u0107 managed to win over the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (SKJ) to his position on this matter at the 13th Congress of the SKJ, held in 1986, and then set up a commission to work out the details of constitutional reforms. However, Stamboli\u0107 was deposed by his erstwhile prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1987, who had used the issue of Kosovo to boost his political support.\n\n=== Under Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ===\nThe much harder-line Milo\u0161evi\u0107 pushed for a tougher policy towards the Kosovo Albanians. On 28 March 1989 he had the Serbian Constitution amended to give the Serbian Assembly exclusive rights to decide on the constitutional structure of the country, overturning the veto right of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to the ICTY indictment of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds [[supermajority]]. The Speaker of the Assembly nonetheless declared that the amendments had passed and they were duly enacted.<ref name=\"icty1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm |title=The Prosecutor of the Tribunal against Slobodan Milosevic et al. |agency=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=2001-10-16 |accessdate=2016-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528081303/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm |archivedate=28 May 2005 }}</ref> This however was refuted in court by Vukasin Jokanovic who was the President of the Kosovo Assembly at the time during the trial.

It also changed back the name of Kosovo from the '''Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo''' to the '''Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija''', returning the province to the status predating the 1970s and using the Serbian name for the western part of the region.<ref>[http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909071238/http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html |date=9 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1990 constitution was strongly resisted by Kosovo's Albanians, who set up a \"shadow\" government to parallel the official Serb-dominated establishment. The Albanian-dominated Kosovo Assembly passed an unofficial resolution declaring Kosovo an independent entity within Yugoslavia, equivalent in status to the existing republics. A few days later the Kosovo Assembly was formally dissolved by the Serbian parliament on 5 July 1990, all its laws declared invalid and its legislative functions transferred to the Belgrade legislature. On 22 September 1991, the deposed Albanian members of the Kosovo Assembly met secretly in [[Pristina]] to declare Kosovo an independent sovereign state, the \"[[Republic of Kosova]]\". [[Albania]] was the only country to recognize the independence.<ref name=\"icty1\" /><ref>Louis Sell, ''Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'', p. 93. (Duke University Press, 2003)</ref>\n\nKosovo independence was also not supported by the international community, which had maintained a consistent policy since 1991 of upholding the existing borders of the individual republics of Yugoslavia. On 10 October 1991 the CSCE (now the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]) warned that member states would \"never ... recognize any changes of borders, ''whether external or internal'', brought about by force.\" The United States, the [[European Community]] and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement on 18 October 1991 reaffirming these principles.<ref>Suzanne N. Lalonde, ''Determining Boundaries in a Conflicted World: The Role of Uti Possidetis'', p. 176 (McGill-Queen's Press, 2002)</ref>\n\nThe same set of principles remained the cornerstone of international policy towards the former Yugoslavia throughout the [[Yugoslav wars]]. Thus, for instance, the international community insisted on retaining [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]] as unified states, denying recognition to the breakaway [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].\n\n==Status and the Kosovo War==\nKosovo's status was a key issue in the political violence that presaged the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999. The ethnic Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] was formed after the initial attack of Serbian forces at the village of [[Ra\u010dak]], where 40 men and boys were executed by Serbian forces.\n\nThe international community also did not support independence for Kosovo at this stage. The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1160|UN Security Council Resolution 1160]] on 31 March 1998 urging the parties to reach a peaceful settlement and rejecting any unilateral attempts to redraw borders, instead \"affirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" The same principles were reaffirmed in a high-level meeting during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign when the [[G8]] foreign ministers adopted a policy of establishing \"an interim administration for Kosovo ... under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm |title=Statement by the Chairman on the conclusion of the meeting of the G-8 Foreign Ministers held at the Petersberg Centre on 6 May 1999 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 1999, a joint Finnish-Russian team headed by former Finnish president [[Martti Ahtisaari]] presented a set of proposals to President Milo\u0161evi\u0107.

Their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups, or to pre-World War I state borders.

It also promoted the [[Vardar Macedonia|Vardar region]] of southern Serbia to the status of a separate republic, the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]]. The constitution, adopted on 31 January 1946, stated that \"The People's Republic of Serbia includes the autonomous province of Vojvodina and the autonomous Kosovo-Metohijan region.\" It did not spell out the rights and scope of the autonomous provinces, instead stating that this was a matter to be \"determined by the constitution of the [parent] republic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1946.txt |format=TXT |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERATIVE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (1946) |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe later Constitution of the SFRY, adopted on 7 April 1963, again provided for republics to \"found autonomous provinces in accordance with the constitution in areas with distinctive national characteristics or in areas with other distinguishing features, on the basis of the express will of the population of these area.\" Within the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], \"there are the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija, established in 1945 by decision of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia in accordance with the express will of the population of these areas.\" The details of the rights and scope of the provinces was, again, reserved to the republics' constitutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1963.doc |format=DOC |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, at the time the world's longest, greatly changed the constitutional setup within Yugoslavia. It increased the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and gave both autonomous provinces ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments as changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies. It also granted equal status to the Serbian, Albanian and Turkish languages and alphabets within Kosovo.\n\nThis created anomalous situation, sometimes said to be unique in world history, in which any of the provinces of Serbia could veto a decision pertaining to entire Serbia, while the parliament of Serbia could not influence decisions of the provincial parliaments. This led to central Serbia, which was not a political unit, being effectively under control of the provinces.\n\nThe 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War [the Second World War] and socialist revolution....\" The separately promulgated Constitution of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo declared that:\n\n{{cquote|The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is an autonomous, socialist, democratic, socio-political and self-managing community of working people and citizens, equal Albanians, Montenegrins, Muslims, Serbs, Turks, and members of other nations and nationalities and ethnic groups, based on the power of and self-management by the working class and all working people. The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.}}\n\nThe expansion of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became a rallying cry for a new generation of Serbian politicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]], who became [[President of Serbia]], urged the other republics to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy.\n\nStamboli\u0107 managed to win over the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (SKJ) to his position on this matter at the 13th Congress of the SKJ, held in 1986, and then set up a commission to work out the details of constitutional reforms. However, Stamboli\u0107 was deposed by his erstwhile prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1987, who had used the issue of Kosovo to boost his political support.\n\n=== Under Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ===\nThe much harder-line Milo\u0161evi\u0107 pushed for a tougher policy towards the Kosovo Albanians. On 28 March 1989 he had the Serbian Constitution amended to give the Serbian Assembly exclusive rights to decide on the constitutional structure of the country, overturning the veto right of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to the ICTY indictment of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds [[supermajority]].

It also changed back the name of Kosovo from the '''Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo''' to the '''Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija''', returning the province to the status predating the 1970s and using the Serbian name for the western part of the region.<ref>[http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909071238/http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html |date=9 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1990 constitution was strongly resisted by Kosovo's Albanians, who set up a \"shadow\" government to parallel the official Serb-dominated establishment. The Albanian-dominated Kosovo Assembly passed an unofficial resolution declaring Kosovo an independent entity within Yugoslavia, equivalent in status to the existing republics. A few days later the Kosovo Assembly was formally dissolved by the Serbian parliament on 5 July 1990, all its laws declared invalid and its legislative functions transferred to the Belgrade legislature. On 22 September 1991, the deposed Albanian members of the Kosovo Assembly met secretly in [[Pristina]] to declare Kosovo an independent sovereign state, the \"[[Republic of Kosova]]\". [[Albania]] was the only country to recognize the independence.<ref name=\"icty1\" /><ref>Louis Sell, ''Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'', p. 93. (Duke University Press, 2003)</ref>\n\nKosovo independence was also not supported by the international community, which had maintained a consistent policy since 1991 of upholding the existing borders of the individual republics of Yugoslavia. On 10 October 1991 the CSCE (now the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]) warned that member states would \"never ... recognize any changes of borders, ''whether external or internal'', brought about by force.\" The United States, the [[European Community]] and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement on 18 October 1991 reaffirming these principles.<ref>Suzanne N. Lalonde, ''Determining Boundaries in a Conflicted World: The Role of Uti Possidetis'', p. 176 (McGill-Queen's Press, 2002)</ref>\n\nThe same set of principles remained the cornerstone of international policy towards the former Yugoslavia throughout the [[Yugoslav wars]]. Thus, for instance, the international community insisted on retaining [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]] as unified states, denying recognition to the breakaway [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].\n\n==Status and the Kosovo War==\nKosovo's status was a key issue in the political violence that presaged the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999. The ethnic Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] was formed after the initial attack of Serbian forces at the kosovarian village of Re\u00e7ak, where 40 men and boys were executed by Serbian forces.\n\nThe international community also did not support independence for Kosovo at this stage. The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1160|UN Security Council Resolution 1160]] on 31 March 1998 urging the parties to reach a peaceful settlement and rejecting any unilateral attempts to redraw borders, instead \"affirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" The same principles were reaffirmed in a high-level meeting during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign, when the [[G8]] foreign ministers adopted a policy of establishing \"an interim administration for Kosovo ... under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm |title=Statement by the Chairman on the conclusion of the meeting of the G-8 Foreign Ministers held at the Petersberg Centre on 6 May 1999 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 1999, a joint Finnish-Russian team headed by former Finnish president [[Martti Ahtisaari]] presented a set of proposals to President Milo\u0161evi\u0107. These included a commitment to establish \"an interim political framework agreement providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the region.\" Under severe pressure from the ongoing NATO bombing, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 agreed to withdraw Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and permit the establishment of a UN-led administration in the province, with security to be provided by a NATO-led force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]).<ref>A.R.

Over 6.6 million people were entitled to vote in the national referendum. Kosovo did not vote. During the nearly one-century of Serbian rule in Kosovo, this is the only attempt to legally incorporate Kosovo into Serbia, and it was seen by Albanians as an attempt to prejudge the result of the negotiations. In the [[preamble]] to the constitution it states that \"Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia with significant autonomy\". Serbian legal scholars found that this unambiguous statement means it would be unconstitutional for Kosovo to secede from Serbia.\n\n===Positions of the parties===\n*Serbia's position on the status of Kosovo is that Kosovo should enjoy substantial autonomy, but not be granted independence. Frequently dubbed \"more than autonomy, less than independence,\" Belgrade's vision for Kosovo includes expanding autonomy in which Kosovo is largely free to govern itself, although Kosovo would not be permitted an independent role in international relations or defence and would remain nominally within the state of Serbia. The Serbian side has also proposed the [[One Country Two Systems]] formula, i.e. the \"Hong Kong model\" as a solution,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/CI/KIM/301105_3_e.html |title=Compromise by way of \"One Country-Two Systems\" formula |publisher=Mfa.gov.rs |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/news.htm?expressnews&20071107&55&444658 |title=RTHK |publisher=[[RTHK]] |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> but it was rejected by the Albanian politicians.<ref>[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/071105/world/kosovo_talks AP] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=AFP |date=6 November 2007 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Kosovo_rejects_Hong_Kong_model_proposed_by_Serbia/articleshow/2520832.cms |title=Kosovo rejects Hong Kong model proposed by Serbia |work=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=2010-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220185344/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Kosovo_rejects_Hong_Kong_model_proposed_by_Serbia/articleshow/2520832.cms |archivedate=20 December 2007 |author-link=Agence France Presse }}</ref> Serbia argues that Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and therefore contrary to the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] and principles of international law. Belgrade also asserts the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] has allowed widespread discrimination against Kosovo's Serb minority and has not facilitated the return of about 200,000 of [[internally displaced persons]] who fled Kosovo during and immediately after the conflict. Serbia insists that [[UNSCR 1244]], which envisioned a UN-facilitated political process to determine status, precludes independence through a preambular reference to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia).

From then on, the ancient Indian architecture and civil engineering continued to develop and grow. It found manifestation in the construction of temples, palaces and forts on the Indian peninsula and the neighbouring regions. In ancient India, architecture and construction as Sthapatya Kala known literal translation of which the art of constructing (some) means.  achieved during the period of Kushan Empire and Maurya empires, the Indian architecture and construction in regions such as Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Statues of Buddha were cut and covers entire mountain walls and cliffs, like Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan. mixed over a period of time, the construction of ancient Indian art and Greek styles and spread to Central Asia.  On the other hand took the Buddhism Indian style of architecture and construction in countries such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, China, Korea and Japan. Angkor Wat is a living testimony to the contribution of Indian civil engineering and architecture of the Cambodian Khmer heritage in the field of architecture and construction.  In mainland India of today there are several wonders of the ancient India\u2019s architectural heritage, including World Heritage sites like Ajanta, Ellora, Khajuraho, Mahabodhi Temple, Sanchi, Brihadisvara Temple and Mahabalipuram\n*\n\n==== Navigation ====\n\nA panel in Mohenjodaro found shows a sailing vessel, and thousands of years later Ajanta murals also show a seafaring ship. The science of shipbuilding and navigation was known to ancient Indians. Sanskrit and Pali texts are replete with maritime references and old Indians, especially from the coastal regions were commercial relations with several countries over the Bay of Bengal as Cambodia, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and even to China. Similar maritime and trade relations existed with the countries on the Arabian Sea as Arabia, Egypt and Persia.\n\nmarine also by about 500 CE, sextant and compass was not unknown to ancient Indian shipyards and navigators. JL Reid, member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Shipbuilders, England, at about the beginning of the 20th century in the Bombay Gazetteer was published that \u201c\u201dThe early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet to the north and east fixing , foundations in the laying and other religious ceremonies.

He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the [[British East India Company]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. The Mysore Rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&nbsp;km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], and were soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Roddam Narasimha (1985), [http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750\u20131850 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182042/http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science\"Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, [[Tippu Sultan]], continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\" - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2008).

From then on, the ancient Indian architecture and civil engineering continued to develop and grow. It found manifestation in the construction of temples, palaces and forts on the Indian peninsula and the neighbouring regions. In ancient India, architecture and construction as Sthapatya Kala known literal translation of which the art of constructing (some) means.  achieved during the period of Kushan Empire and Maurya empires, the Indian architecture and construction in regions such as Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Statues of Buddha were cut and covers entire mountain walls and cliffs, like Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan. mixed over a period of time, the construction of ancient Indian art and Greek styles and spread to Central Asia.  On the other hand took the Buddhism Indian style of architecture and construction in countries such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, China, Korea and Japan. Angkor Wat is a living testimony to the contribution of Indian civil engineering and architecture of the Cambodian Khmer heritage in the field of architecture and construction.  In mainland India of today there are several wonders of the ancient India\u2019s architectural heritage, including World Heritage sites like Ajanta, Ellora, Khajuraho, Mahabodhi Temple, Sanchi, Brihadisvara Temple and Mahabalipuram\n*\n\n==== Navigation ====\n\nA panel in Mohenjodaro found shows a sailing vessel, and thousands of years later Ajanta murals also show a seafaring ship. The science of shipbuilding and navigation was known to ancient Indians. Sanskrit and Pali texts are replete with maritime references and old Indians, especially from the coastal regions were commercial relations with several countries over the Bay of Bengal as Cambodia, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and even to China. Similar maritime and trade relations existed with the countries on the Arabian Sea as Arabia, Egypt and Persia.\n\nmarine also by about 500 CE, sextant and compass was not unknown to ancient Indian shipyards and navigators.

He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the [[British East India Company]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. The Mysore Rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&nbsp;km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], and were soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Roddam Narasimha (1985), [http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750\u20131850 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182042/http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science\"Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, [[Tippu Sultan]], continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000.
