He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Process of expansion===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry.

The [[Dzungars]] were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols. It has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered, and it took generations for it to recover.<ref>Christian Tyler, ''Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang'' (Rutgers UP, 2003) p. 55</ref>  The Manchu ruling family ([[Aisin Gioro]]) was a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion.\n\n===Burma (Myanmar) === \nThe Qing campaign against Burma (Myanmar) (1765-70) was its most disastrous and costly frontier war. It ended in a stalemate but the Qing rulers could not accept Burma as an equal, and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790, the Qing court considered it a restoration of Chinese suzerainty.<ref>Yingcong Dai, \"A disguised defeat: The Myanmar campaign of the Qing dynasty.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 38.1 (2004): 145-189.</ref>\n\n==Recent tensions ==\n{{Further|East China Sea EEZ disputes|Belt and Road Initiative}}\nWith the 1978 [[Chinese economic reform]] launched by [[Deng Xiaoping]], China has increased its political stance, its influence and its power abroad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Asle Toje|title=Will China's Rise Be Peaceful?: Security, Stability, and Legitimacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA5EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT24|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24\u201325|isbn=9780190675417}}</ref> On one side, China remains deeply neutral and not involving in any conflict, and the land borders are stable.

Tungning was annexed as part of [[Fujian]] province. The Qing were \"reluctant colonizers\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. <ref>Tonio Andrade, ''How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century'', Columbia University Press.</ref> The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Japanese interest]] and a defeated [[Keelung Campaign|French invasion]] attempt.\n\nAfter British troops [[British expedition to Tibet|invaded Tibet]] in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending [[Zhao Erfeng]] to further integrate Tibet into China.  He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Process of expansion===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry. Zunghar Khanate (\u0417\u04af\u04af\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u043b\u0441) was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in Central Asia. The [[Dzungars]] were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols. It has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered, and it took generations for it to recover.<ref>Christian Tyler, ''Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang'' (Rutgers UP, 2003) p. 55</ref>  The Manchu ruling family ([[Aisin Gioro]]) was a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion.\n\n===Burma (Myanmar) === \nThe Qing campaign against Burma (Myanmar) (1765-70) was its most disastrous and costly frontier war. It ended in a stalemate but the Qing rulers could not accept Burma as an equal, and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790, the Qing court considered it a restoration of Chinese suzerainty.<ref>Yingcong Dai, \"A disguised defeat: The Myanmar campaign of the Qing dynasty.\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 38.1 (2004): 145-189.</ref>\n\n==Recent tensions ==\n{{Further|East China Sea EEZ disputes|Belt and Road Initiative}}\nWith the 1978 [[Chinese economic reform]] launched by [[Deng Xiaoping]], China has increased its political stance, its influence and its power abroad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Asle Toje|title=Will China's Rise Be Peaceful?: Security, Stability, and Legitimacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA5EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT24|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24\u201325|isbn=9780190675417}}</ref> On one side, China remains deeply neutral and not involving in any conflict, and the land borders are stable.

A \"legion\" consisted of a single integrated command, with individual components from the [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]]. When it was originally raised, the Georgia Legion comprised seven infantry companies, four cavalry troops, and a single battery. The concept of a multiple-branch unit was fine in theory, but never was a practical application for Civil War armies and, early in the war, the individual elements were assigned to other organizations.\n\n==Infantry component==\nThe infantry [[battalion]] was assigned to [[Howell Cobb]]'s [[brigade]] in [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s Division of [[James Longstreet]]'s [[Corps]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The infantry battalion surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.\n\n===Organization===\n*'''Staff'''\n**'''Colonel''' [[Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb]] (He formed the Legion in the late summer of 1861, and served as its colonel until he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] in the fall of 1862.)

A \"legion\" consisted of a single integrated command, with individual components from the [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]]. When it was originally raised, the Georgia Legion comprised seven infantry companies, four cavalry troops, and a single battery. The concept of a multiple-branch unit was fine in theory, but never was a practical application for Civil War armies and, early in the war, the individual elements were assigned to other organizations.\n\n==Infantry component==\nThe infantry [[battalion]] was assigned to [[Howell Cobb]]'s [[brigade]] in [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s Division of [[James Longstreet]]'s [[Corps]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The infantry battalion surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.\n\n===Organization===\n*'''Staff'''\n**'''Colonel''' [[Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb]] (He formed the Legion in the late summer of 1861, and served as its colonel until he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] in the fall of 1862.)
