As a love triangle develops, the story deals with the fate of the main characters through the years.\n\n==Plot==\nParth Bhanushali, the grandson and heir to the conservative and affluent Bhanushali family, based in [[Vadodara|Baroda]], falls in love with their employee, a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] girl named Shorvori, Bhatacharya  and marries her at the cost of being disowned by his family. \n\n===2 years later===\nShorvori gets pregnant and is accepted by Parth's family. However, an unfortunate accident results in a miscarriage, rendering Shorvori infertile. Parth and Shorvori keep the miscarriage hidden from the family.\n\nTeni, a carefree bubbly [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] girl who dreams of settling in the US is chosen by Parth and Shorvori as a [[Surrogacy|surrogate]] in return for sending her to the US. Teni gets pregnant with Parth and Shorvori's child through [[IVF]]. Shorvori introduces Teni as her cousin to the family as she begins to live in the Bhanushali house. Later, the family arranges for Teni's engagement but she manages to call it off proclaiming that she is in a relationship with Parth's friend, Aman ([[Kunal Verma]]).\n\nAman proposes to Teni who accepts. She wavers in her decision as she starts falling in love with Parth but decides to keep her word. She, however, ends up confessing her feelings to Parth. Meanwhile, the Bhanushali family is in turmoil following the revelations regarding Teni's pregnancy as Parth accepts the baby to be his. Aman breaks all ties with her and leaves. After some tension, the family eventually accept the surrogacy situation.\n\nIndu ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]]), Parth's mother, starts criticizing Shorvori for lying about her pregnancy. A distressed Shorvori asks Parth to stay away from Teni but a misunderstanding leads her to accuse him of cheating and she ends their relationship. Teni discovers that Shorvori has a fatal brain tumour and had pretended to leave Parth to help him deal with her impending death. Shorvori sends Parth divorce papers. She convinces Teni to keep her secret and marry him. Parth, however, rejects Teni's proposal and is suspicious of Shorvori's behaviour. He plans to confront Shorvori but she meets with an accident and dies before Teni's eyes.\n\nParth struggles to cope with the pain of losing Shorvori. Teni, following Shorvori's wish, finally convinces Parth to move on. Parth finds a video of Shorvori's accident on Teni's phone and accuses her of murdering Shorvori. Teni goes into [[premature labour]] and delivers a girl named Ipshita The P in Ipshita for Parth, S for Shorvori, and the T for Teni. With Teni's life in danger, Parth donates blood saving her life and in return, Teni gives in to his demand that she leave the house.\n\nMeanwhile, Parth's sister, Jagruti's ex-fianc\u00e9e, Rishabh kidnaps baby Ipshita. Parth teams up with Teni to find Rishabh to be the culprit. They discover that he has sold Ipshita to Madamji ([[Kanika Maheshwari]]), a trafficker. Teni rejoins Madamji's dance bar and she and Parth succeed in rescuing Ipshita. Parth realises Teni could never kill Shorvori and that he has fallen in love with Teni.\n\nWhen Teni starts planning to leave for the US, Parth finally confesses his love and Teni accepts his marriage proposal. It is revealed that Shorvori is alive and had been in a coma. She arrives to reclaim Parth on his wedding day but seeing him with Teni, leaves. On her way she is eveteased and a recording of the incident makes it to the news. Parth and Teni decide to go to [[Nainital]] to find Shorvori.\n\nIn Nainital, Shorvori starts working as music teacher. She avoids Parth and Teni wanting them to be together. Teni, on the other hand, decides to reunite them. Parth believes he was imaginging Shorvori and consummates his marriage with Teni. However, the very next day, they come across Shorvori who is forced to accept her true identity.\n\nParth, Teni, Shorvori and Ipshita arrive home and the family is surprised. Teni tries to leave the family by hiring a lawyer and asking for a hefty compensation. However, eventually, the three of them decide to live together with Teni and Shorvori as Parth's wives. Since the arrangement is illegal, Parth must choose. Teni sacrifices her love by manipulating the situation so Shorvori would get picked. Dadaji sees her sacrifice and decides she will live with them as their daughter. Misunderstandings arise between Shorvori and Teni and Teni is about to leave the house when she has a fall and loses her memory. The family bring her back home and help her regain her memory by making Teni take care of Ipshita, but their plan doesn\u2019t work. Shorvori realises Parth loves Teni more than her and that their marital life isn\u2019t the same anymore. However, she is understanding and gives him her blessings. Later, suspecting the Bhanushalis of wanting to sell her off, Teni runs away from their home.\n\n===6 years later===\nShorvori has died and Teni has been missing all these years. The family miss Teni as they see her traits in Ipshita. Teni is leading a happy life in [[Delhi]] and has become a sales manager. She is about to marry Iqbal ([[Mohammed Iqbal Khan]]). Circumstances lead to Parth and Teni meeting each other and a confused Teni decides to move back to Baroda to find out about her past.

As a love triangle develops, the story deals with the fate of the main characters through the years.\n\n==Plot==\nParth Bhanushali, the grandson and heir to the conservative and affluent Bhanushali family, based in [[Vadodara|Baroda]], falls in love with their employee, a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] girl named Shorvori, Bhatacharya  and marries her at the cost of being disowned by his family. \n\n===2 years later===\nShorvori gets pregnant and is accepted by Parth's family. However, an unfortunate accident results in a miscarriage, rendering Shorvori infertile. Parth and Shorvori keep the miscarriage hidden from the family.\n\nTeni, a carefree bubbly [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] girl who dreams of settling in the US is chosen by Parth and Shorvori as a [[Surrogacy|surrogate]] in return for sending her to the US. Teni gets pregnant with Parth and Shorvori's child through [[IVF]]. Shorvori introduces Teni as her cousin to the family as she begins to live in the Bhanushali house. Later, the family arranges for Teni's engagement but she manages to call it off proclaiming that she is in a relationship with Parth's friend, Aman ([[Kunal Verma]]).\n\nAman proposes to Teni who accepts. She wavers in her decision as she starts falling in love with Parth but decides to keep her word. She, however, ends up confessing her feelings to Parth. Meanwhile, the Bhanushali family is in turmoil following the revelations regarding Teni's pregnancy as Parth accepts the baby to be his. Aman breaks all ties with her and leaves. After some tension, the family eventually accept the surrogacy situation.\n\nIndu ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]]), Parth's mother, starts criticizing Shorvori for lying about her pregnancy. A distressed Shorvori asks Parth to stay away from Teni but a misunderstanding leads her to accuse him of cheating and she ends their relationship. Teni discovers that Shorvori has a fatal brain tumour and had pretended to leave Parth to help him deal with her impending death. Shorvori sends Parth divorce papers. She convinces Teni to keep her secret and marry him. Parth, however, rejects Teni's proposal and is suspicious of Shorvori's behaviour. He plans to confront Shorvori but she meets with an accident and dies before Teni's eyes.\n\nParth struggles to cope with the pain of losing Shorvori. Teni, following Shorvori's wish, finally convinces Parth to move on. Parth finds a video of Shorvori's accident on Teni's phone and accuses her of murdering Shorvori. Teni goes into [[premature labour]] and delivers a girl named Ipshita The P in Ipshita for Parth, S for Shorvori, and the T for Teni. With Teni's life in danger, Parth donates blood saving her life and in return, Teni gives in to his demand that she leave the house.\n\nMeanwhile, Parth's sister, Jagruti's ex-fianc\u00e9e, Rishabh kidnaps baby Ipshita. Parth teams up with Teni to find Rishabh to be the culprit. They discover that he has sold Ipshita to Madamji ([[Kanika Maheshwari]]), a trafficker. Teni rejoins Madamji's dance bar and she and Parth succeed in rescuing Ipshita. Parth realises Teni could never kill Shorvori and that he has fallen in love with Teni.\n\nWhen Teni starts planning to leave for the US, Parth finally confesses his love and Teni accepts his marriage proposal. It is revealed that Shorvori is alive and had been in a coma. She arrives to reclaim Parth on his wedding day but seeing him with Teni, leaves. On her way she is eveteased and a recording of the incident makes it to the news. Parth and Teni decide to go to [[Nainital]] to find Shorvori.\n\nIn Nainital, Shorvori starts working as music teacher. She avoids Parth and Teni wanting them to be together. Teni, on the other hand, decides to reunite them. Parth believes he was imaginging Shorvori and consummates his marriage with Teni. However, the very next day, they come across Shorvori who is forced to accept her true identity.\n\nParth, Teni, Shorvori and Ipshita arrive home and the family is surprised. Teni tries to leave the family by hiring a lawyer and asking for a hefty compensation. However, eventually, the three of them decide to live together with Teni and Shorvori as Parth's wives. Since the arrangement is illegal, Parth must choose. Teni sacrifices her love by manipulating the situation so Shorvori would get picked. Dadaji sees her sacrifice and decides she will live with them as their daughter. Misunderstandings arise between Shorvori and Teni and Teni is about to leave the house when she has a fall and loses her memory. The family bring her back home and help her regain her memory by making Teni take care of Ipshita, but their plan doesn\u2019t work. Shorvori realises Parth loves Teni more than her and that their marital life isn\u2019t the same anymore. However, she is understanding and gives him her blessings. Later, suspecting the Bhanushalis of wanting to sell her off, Teni runs away from their home.\n\n===6 years later===\nShorvori has died and Teni has been missing all these years.

All adult male descendants of previous monarchs were eligible for the throne. The kingship regularly switched from one line of royal descendants to another, though they were all closely related. Constantine was able to rise to the throne, despite his cousin and predecessor having a son of his own. The next two kings (Kenneth III, Malcolm II) were his cousins, and killed their respective predecessor to gain the throne. The succession rule had the benefit of ensuring that there would always be an adult king on the throne, avoiding the usual problems of [[minority reign]]s. The various kings had their lands and power bases in different areas of Scotland, preventing any single region from claiming full domination of the others. This may have helped the country avoid significant [[secession]] movements. The downside was that any single king had to face adult rivals for the throne. His kinsmen had their own ambitions and would not wait for his death from natural causes to achieve them. The succession was often decided through acts of warfare and murder, resulting in early deaths and high casualty rates in the extended royal family.<ref name=\"Mitchison\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ptklKx05AQ0C&pg=PA13 Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 13]</ref>\n\nDuring the 10th century, there were dynastic conflicts in Scotland between two rival lines of royalty. One descended from  [[Causant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda]] (Constantine I, reigned 862-877), the other from his brother [[\u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda]] (reigned 877-878).  Constantine III belonged to the second line. His royal ancestors included \u00c1ed himself, [[Constantine II of Scotland]] (reigned 900-943), [[Indulf]] (reigned 954-962), and [[Cuil\u00e9n]] (reigned 967-971).  [[Amla\u00edb of Scotland]] (reigned 973-977) was his paternal uncle.<ref name=\"CawleyAedh\"/><ref name=\"Smyth\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 223-224]</ref> The alternation between the two royal lines seems to have been peaceful for a long time; [[Alfred P. Smyth]] regards this early phase as  \"a century of kingly coexistence\". The armed conflict between the lines seems to have started in the 960s, when Cuil\u00e9n challenged the rule of his cousin [[Dub, King of Scotland]] (962-967). The initial motivation behind the conflict is unclear. Smyth speculates that control over the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] might have been a major factor.<ref name=\"Smyth\"/>\n\n==Reign==\n\nAccording to [[John of Fordun]] (14th century), [[Kenneth II of Scotland]] (reigned 971-995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing \"''the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed''\", thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing [[Lady Finella]], daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in ''the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots'', collected by [[William Forbes Skene]], provide the account of Finnguala killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref name=\"CawleyMalcolm I\">{{harvnb|Cawley|2011|loc=[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SCOTLAND.htm#_Toc253996179 Malcolm]}}.Listing includes all kings descended from him, excluding Kenneth III.</ref><ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources. John of Fordun credits Constantine III (Causant\u00edn mac Cuil\u00e9n) and Kenneth III (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib) with the planning, claiming that Kenneth II planned to change the laws of succession. See ''ESSH'', pp. 512&ndash;515.</ref> The [[Annals of Ulster]] simply record \"''Cinaed son of Mael Coluim [Kenneth, son of Malcolm], king of Scotland, was deceitfully killed''\", with no indication of who killed him.<ref name=\"CawleyMalcolm I\"/><ref name=\"Annals of Ulster\">[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001A/ Annals of Ulster, online translation. Entry U995.1]</ref>\n\nIn the account of John of Fordun, '''Constantine the Bald, son of King Cullen''' and Gryme were \"''plotting unceasingly the death of the king and his son''\". One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, \"''at no great distance from his own abode''\". The hunt took him to [[Fettercairn]], where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy plot. She managed to lure him to \"''an out-of-the-way little cottage''\", where a [[booby trap]] was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of [[crossbow]]s. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and \"''was shot through by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.''\" Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her [[abettor]]s, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella, but burned Fettercairn to the ground.<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination.<ref name=\"Smyth2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-225]</ref> [[Alan Orr Anderson]] raised his own doubts concerning the story of  Finella, which he considered \"''semi-mythical''\". He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means \"white shoulders\", but suggested it derived from \"find-ela\" (white swan). The name figures in toponyms such as Finella Hill (near [[Fordoun]]) and Finella Den (near [[St Cyrus]]), while local tradition in The Mearns ([[Kincardineshire]]) has Finella walking atop the treetops from one location to the other. Anderson thus theorized that Finella could be a mythical figure, suggesting she was a local [[Water deity|stream-goddess]].<ref name=\"Anderson\">[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028144313 Anderson, Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286, p. 515]</ref> A later passage of John of Fordun mentions Finele as mother of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland]] (reigned 1040\u20131057), but this is probably an error based on the similarity of names. Macbeth was son of [[Findl\u00e1ech of Moray]], not of a woman called Finella.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/><ref name=\"Skene4\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XLIV (44), pages 180]</ref>\n\nThe narrative of John of Fordun continues on to the reign of Constantine III. The day following the death of Kenneth II, '''Constantine the Bald, son of King Cullen''' usurped the throne. He had reportedly won the support of a number of nobles. The throne was also claimed by his cousin [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], son of Kenneth II, resulting in long-lasting division of the Scottish population, and conflict. Constantine III reigned for a year and a half [18 months], \"''continually harassed by Malcolm and his illegitimate uncle, named Kenneth, a soldier of known prowess, who was his unwearied persecutor, and strove with his whole might to kill him, above all others.\"''<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> The Chronicle of the Kings of Scotts (''Cronica Regum Scottorum'', 12th century) shortens the reign to one year and four months (16 months).<ref name=\"CawleyAedh\"/><ref name=\"Skene2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XVkJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29 Skene, Chronicles of the Picts and Scots, p. 131]</ref> This source was a king-list compiled during the reign of [[William the Lion]] (reign 1165\u20131214), the last king mentioned in it.

Charles Cawley suggests treating his existence with caution.<ref name=\"CawleyMalcolm I\"/> John of Fordun had apparently listed this Kenneth as an illegitimate son of [[Malcolm I of Scotland]].

Appendix article: Critical Review of the Scottic or Gaelic History, p. 18-19]</ref> Alex Woolf accepted the identification of '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm''' with Kenneth III as a possible solution, but suggested a number of alternatives. Kenneth II himself was a '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm'''; his name could have been transferred to the killer of his successor by a faulty text. Or '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm''' could be an accidental reversal of '''Malcolm (II), son of Kenneth'''. Or the killer could be a  '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm''' who was not actually a member of the royal family.<ref name=\"Woolf3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=7d1SP6ztlq0C&pg=PA89 Woolf, From Pictland to Alba, 789-1070, p. 221-222]</ref>\n\nThe [[Annals of Tigernach]] report that Constantine was killed in a battle between the Scots in 997: \"''A battle between the Scots, in which fell Constantine son of Culannan, king of Scotland, and many others.''\" Another entry of the same year reports the death of [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde]], though it is unclear if the two deaths were connected.<ref name=\"Annals of Tigernach\">[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100002A/index.html Annals of Tigernach, online translation.

'''Constantine, son of Culen''' was killed by '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm''' (see above) at ''[[Bertha (Perth)|Rathinveramon]]''. Constantine's body was transported for burial to [[Iona]]. An entry in the [[Chronicle of Melrose]] describes \"''King Constantine, Culen's son,  ... slain by the sword''\" at the mouth of  [[River Almond, Perthshire|Almond]] in Tegalere. Again the killer is reported as '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm'''.<ref name=\"Anderson2\"/> John of Fordun's narrative is more verbose.  According to it, Constantine and Kenneth, son of Malcolm met one day in Laudonia ([[Lothian]]), by the banks of the [[River Almond, Lothian|River Almond]]. They engaged in battle, resulting in great slaughter on both sides and the death of both leaders. The guards of Constantine fled to Gryme (Kenneth III), \"''colleague\"'' of their leader, allowing him to win the throne. However, news of the battle and its results reached Malcolm (II) in [[Cumbria]]. He learned of the death of his \"''uncle and the rest of his faithful friends\"'', and returned to gather reinforcements for his cause\u2014though he was defeated in his initial conflict against Gryme.<ref name=\"Skene\"/>\n\nJohn of Fordun consistently depicts Malcolm II holding Cumbria, emerging from it to combat Constantine III and Kenneth III (or his son Giric). In 1000, Malcolm reportedly defended Cumbria against the invasion of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]], [[List of English monarchs|King of England]].<ref name=\"Smyth3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 226]</ref> A relevant entry from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' confirms that the Danish fleet which regularly raided England departed in 1000. This sudden relief from attack \u00c6thelred used to gather his thoughts, resources, and armies: the fleet's departure in 1000 \"allowed \u00c6thelred to carry out a devastation of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], the motive for which is part of the lost history of the north.\"<ref name=\"Smyth3\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y65NxJaMtcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=Steathclyde&f=false Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 379.]</ref> But this indicates the limits to Constantine's (and Kenneth's) area of authority, and informs us that Cumbria/Strathclyde lay beyond them.<ref name=\"Smyth3\"/> The opponent of \u00c6thelred is not however specified by the Chronicle. [[Benjamin Hudson]] notes that John of Fordun was at times confused when depicting events of this period. The conflict depicted could actually be one between \u00c6thelred and Kenneth III, Scottish and Anglo-Saxon armies fighting over control of Strathclyde\u2014Aethelred wanting to restore Anglo-Saxon control in an area once conquered by [[Edmund I|Edmund the Elder]] (reigned 939-946), his grandfather. Perhaps he was desperately seeking to add some [[revenue]] to his treasury. Kenneth and the [[Scottish people|Scots]] were naturally unwilling to lose an area under their own rule for two generations.<ref name=\"Hudson\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uMtuva92HwwC&pg=PA226 Hudson, Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n: Irish and Scottish High-Kings of the Early Middle Ages, p. 218-219]</ref>\n\n==Location of death==\n\n[[James Young Simpson]], who had written several articles on archaeology, observed that there were contradictory accounts concerning the location of Constantine's death. While most accounts place the battle near the River Almond, there were two rivers of that name in Scotland, one in [[Perthshire]] and one in [[Lothian]]. [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] identified the one in Perthsire to have been the intended location. But John of Fordun, the [[Scotichronicon]], [[Hector Boece]], and [[George Buchanan]] all point to the one in Lothian. The [[Chronicle of Melrose]] places the battle near the [[River Avon (Falkirk)|River Avon]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] places it near the river \"Awyne\". [[John Lesley]] places it near the [[River Annan]], and considers it part of an ongoing invasion of Cumbria.<ref name=\"Simpson\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 136-139]</ref><ref name=\"Simpson2\">[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/simpson_james13.htm Sir James Young Simpson (biography) Appendix]. Listing of archaeological articles written by Simpson</ref>\n\nThere are also contradictions concerning the location of the battle in relation to the river. The Scotichronicon, Melrose, and Wyntoun placed the battle at the [[river source]]. Melrose also adding the word \"Tegalere\" to describe  the location. Which might be the same as the \"Inregale regens\" of the Scotichronicon and the \"Indegale\" of the ''Liber Dumblain''. Boece and Buchanan place the battle at a [[river mouth]], where the Almond enters the [[Firth of Forth]]. That is where [[Cramond]] is located, called \"Crawmond\" in some editions of Boece. The \"Nomina Regum Scottorum et Pictorum\", discovered by [[Robert Sibbald]] at the [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory]], place the death sites of both [[Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn]] and Constantine III at Rathveramoen (Rathinveramon). Which etymologically derives from \"Rath Inver Amoen\", the [[Ringfort|r\u00e1th]] at the mouth of the Amoen/Amon (the Almond). That is the fortress [[Bertha (Perth)|Bertha]] in Perth,<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> located at the mouth of the Almond. A location where the Almond joins the [[River Tay]], and in proximity to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].<ref name=\"Woolf2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=nPFY1DXNH9kC&pg=PA260 Woolf, Scotland, p. 260]</ref> Rathinveramon also lay at short distance from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].

Which was probably the same as the \"Bellathor\", mentioned alongside \"Rigmonath\" as the major settlements of their time. Rigmonath has been identified with Rigmonaid, another name for [[St Andrews]]. Since Rigmonath was a church-settlement, perhaps the same was true for Bellathor. Seeking for a likely location in the vicinity of Rathinveramon, Woolf suggests that Bellathor was an older name for Scone. The location was used for the inauguration ceremonies of kings, pointing at the significance of the area.<ref name=\"Woolf4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=7d1SP6ztlq0C&pg=PA89 Woolf, From Pictland to Alba, 789-1070, p. 103-105]</ref> Earlier the same area, including Forteviot, had served as the population centre of the southern [[Picts]]. The lack of fortification at Forteviot could indicate that it too served as a church site. One associated with the kings.<ref name=\"Woolf4\"/> Already in 728, there is mention of a Pictish royal stronghold at the hill of Moncrieffe, where the River Tay meets the [[River Earn]]. The location lies just outside Perth, 8&nbsp;km from Forteviot, close to both [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] and Scone. Suggesting that the area long served as a \"key royal centre\", though the central location switched over time.

The Reverend John Muckarsie alluded to this idea, in a text eventually collected in the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|Statistical Account of Scotland]] by [[Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet]]. In 1780, the founding meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] took place. Its founder [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan]] mentioned the idea in his opening [[discourse]]. He noted an extant transcription of the Cat Stane's text, reading: \"IN HOC TUM- JAC - CONSTAN- VIC- VICT\". Where \"Constan\" was understood to have been Constantine IV (III). The speech was recorded in [[The Scots Magazine]].<ref name=\"Simpson\"/><ref name=\"Simpson3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 123-125]</ref> The idea went that the Cat Stane was erected as a [[memorial]] for Constantine, at the location where the man lost his life in battle. The [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account]] went a bit further, suggesting that the stone marked the [[burial]] place of Constantine.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> Simpson strongly opposed this theory. Finding it unlikely that such a monument would be erected for Constantine the Bald, a king who fell in a civil war. A king with no family legacy. A king who was treated with contempt by primary sources. He examined other transcription of the texts, where the word \"Constan\" was absent. Dismissing the theory as based on a faulty reading of the original text.<ref name=\"Simpson4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 139-140]</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Constantine III (Alba).jpg|thumb|upright|17th-century portrait, when he was reckoned as Constantine IV]]\nThe stanzas of [[The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]] covering Constantine III give him a mostly negative assessment: ''\"A king will take [the sovereignty], who will not be king; after him, Scotland will be nothing. It will be the weak following the strong; though true is what my lips relate. A king with reproach above his head; alas for Scotland during his short time! Feeble men will be about him, in the region of [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], of melodious shields. A year and a half (a bright space), that will be his whole reign; from taking [[Gaels]] (hostages?) he will go to death; he falls, his people fall. He will fight great battles in Scotland; by the disgrace of his head he will destroy colours. He will be in communion of battle, from [[Stirling]] to Abertay. ''\" Anderson suggested that this would be the area from Stirling to Tentsmuir (Abertay Sands), the traditional Scottish boundary with \"Danish [[Northumbria]]\"([[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]).<ref name=\"Anderson2\"/><ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nBerch\u00e1n gave a negative portrayal of [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]] as well, calling him \"the [[Fratricide]]\", who  ''\"would bring danger on everyone ''\". Kenneth II  ''\"would attack his own people as well as his enemies ''\". Probably alluding to Kenneth killing members of the Scottish nobility, people who were related to him in various ways. Hudson suspects that further details on the killings of Kenneth II could be found in [[lost work]]s, part of an early Scottish literal tradition. A tradition which left only fragments in later works.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/><ref name=\"Hudson2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uMtuva92HwwC&pg=PA226 Hudson, Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n: Irish and Scottish High-Kings of the Early Middle Ages, p. 215]</ref> But Kenneth II is depicted as a strong king, while Constantine III is dismissed as a failure. The length of his reign (18 months) confirms that Constantine is the failed \"non-king\" intended. A king surrounded by weak men. The poem places his death by the [[River Tay]], though this is not necessarily a contradiction to other accounts of his death (which place it by river Almond). The Almond flows into the Tay in a location not far from Scone. A location which is also recorded as the place of death to a previous king, [[Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn]] (reigned 859-862).<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nThe ominous verse which has Constantine fall with his people, might allude to the end of his family. As his line probably died with him. The name Grim/Gryme for his successor Kenneth III probably derives from \"greimm\" ([[Middle Irish]]: authority). Berch\u00e1n calls this man [[donn]]. As an adjective it means \"brown\", but as a noun the meaning changes to \"chief\" (prince, lord). Depicting him as stronger king.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nConstantine is not known to have any descendants and he was the last of the line of [[\u00c1ed of Scotland|\u00c1ed]] (\u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda) to have been king.<ref name=\"Smyth\"/> With his death, the rivalry between descendants of Causantin and \u00c1ed gave way to a rivalry between two new royal lines, both descended from Causantin. One line descended from Kenneth II and was represented by his son Malcolm II. The other line descended from his brother [[Dub, King of Scotland]] (reigned 962-967) and was represented by Kenneth III.<ref name=\"Smyth4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-227]</ref>\n\n==Depictions in fiction==\n\n*Constantine III was depicted in two episodes of the animated television series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. The episodes depict the assassination of Kenneth II by Constantine,  and his rise to the throne. Constantine was also depicted in three issues of the ''[[Gargoyles (comic)|Gargoyles]]'' comic book series, covering his struggles against Kenneth III and Malcolm II, and ending at the Battle of Rathveramoen and his death at the hand of Kenneth. [[Gille Coemg\u00e1in of Moray]] is depicted fighting at Constantine's side.<ref name=\"GargoylesWiki\">{{harvnb|GargoylesWiki|2010|loc=[http://gargwiki.net/Constantine_III Constantine III]}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n''For primary sources see also '' '''External links''' ''below.''\n* [[Alan Orr Anderson|Anderson, Alan Orr]], ''Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500&ndash;1286''. 1922 edition, Oliver and Boyd.\n* [[Alan Orr Anderson|Anderson, Alan Orr]], ''Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500&ndash;1286'', volume 1.

All adult male descendants of previous monarchs were eligible for the throne. The kingship regularly switched from one line of royal descendants to another, though they were all closely related. Constantine was able to rise to the throne, despite his cousin and predecessor having a son of his own. The next two kings (Kenneth III, Malcolm II) were his cousins, and killed their respective predecessor to gain the throne. The succession rule had the benefit of ensuring that there would always be an adult king on the throne, avoiding the usual problems of [[minority reign]]s. The various kings had their lands and power bases in different areas of Scotland, preventing any single region from claiming full domination of the others. This may have helped the country avoid significant [[secession]] movements. The downside was that any single king had to face adult rivals for the throne. His kinsmen had their own ambitions and would not wait for his death from natural causes to achieve them. The succession was often decided through acts of warfare and murder, resulting in early deaths and high casualty rates in the extended royal family.<ref name=\"Mitchison\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ptklKx05AQ0C&pg=PA13 Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 13]</ref>\n\nDuring the 10th century, there were dynastic conflicts in Scotland between two rival lines of royalty. One descended from  [[Causant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda]] (Constantine I, reigned 862-877), the other from his brother [[\u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda]] (reigned 877-878).  Constantine III belonged to the second line. His royal ancestors included \u00c1ed himself, [[Constantine II of Scotland]] (reigned 900-943), [[Indulf]] (reigned 954-962), and [[Cuil\u00e9n]] (reigned 967-971).  [[Amla\u00edb of Scotland]] (reigned 973-977) was his paternal uncle.<ref name=\"CawleyAedh\"/><ref name=\"Smyth\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 223-224]</ref> The alternation between the two royal lines seems to have been peaceful for a long time; [[Alfred P. Smyth]] regards this early phase as  \"a century of kingly coexistence\". The armed conflict between the lines seems to have started in the 960s, when Cuil\u00e9n challenged the rule of his cousin [[Dub, King of Scotland]] (962-967). The initial motivation behind the conflict is unclear. Smyth speculates that control over the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] might have been a major factor.<ref name=\"Smyth\"/>\n\n==Reign==\n\nAccording to [[John of Fordun]] (14th century), [[Kenneth II of Scotland]] (reigned 971-995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing \"''the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed''\", thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing [[Lady Finella]], daughter of [[Cuncar of Angus|Cuncar]], [[Mormaer of Angus]], to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in ''the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots'', collected by [[William Forbes Skene]], provide the account of Finnguala killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref name=\"CawleyMalcolm I\">{{harvnb|Cawley|2011|loc=[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SCOTLAND.htm#_Toc253996179 Malcolm]}}.Listing includes all kings descended from him, excluding Kenneth III.</ref><ref>The name of Cuncar's daughter is given as Fenella, Finele or Sibill in later sources. John of Fordun credits Constantine III (Causant\u00edn mac Cuil\u00e9n) and Kenneth III (Cin\u00e1ed mac Duib) with the planning, claiming that Kenneth II planned to change the laws of succession. See ''ESSH'', pp. 512&ndash;515.</ref> The [[Annals of Ulster]] simply record \"''Cinaed son of Mael Coluim [Kenneth, son of Malcolm], king of Scotland, was deceitfully killed''\", with no indication of who killed him.<ref name=\"CawleyMalcolm I\"/><ref name=\"Annals of Ulster\">[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001A/ Annals of Ulster, online translation.

One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, \"''at no great distance from his own abode''\". The hunt took him to [[Fettercairn]], where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy plot. She managed to lure him to \"''an out-of-the-way little cottage''\", where a [[booby trap]] was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of [[crossbow]]s. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and \"''was shot though by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.''\" Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her [[abettor]]s, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella, but burned Fettercairn to the ground.<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination.<ref name=\"Smyth2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-225]</ref> [[Alan Orr Anderson]] raised his own doubts concerning the story of  Finella, which he considered \"''semi-mythical''\". He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means \"white shoulders\", but suggested it derived from \"find-ela\" (white swan). The name figures in toponyms such as Finella Hill (near [[Fordoun]]) and Finella Den (near [[St Cyrus]]), while local tradition in The Mearns ([[Kincardineshire]]) has Finella walking atop the treetops from one location to the other. Anderson thus theorized that Finella could be a mythical figure, suggesting she was a local [[Water deity|stream-goddess]].<ref name=\"Anderson\">[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028144313 Anderson, Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286, p. 515]</ref> A later passage of John of Fordun mentions Finele as mother of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland]] (reigned 1040\u20131057), but this is probably an error based on the similarity of names.

The day following the death of Kenneth II, '''Constantine the Bald, son of King Cullen''' usurped the throne. He had reportedly won the support of a number of nobles. The throne was also claimed by his cousin [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], son of Kenneth II, resulting in long-lasting division of the Scottish population, and conflict. Constantine III reigned for a year and a half [18 months], \"''continually harassed by Malcolm and his illegitimate uncle, named Kenneth, a soldier of known prowess, who was his unwearied persecutor, and strove with his whole might to kill him, above all others.\"''<ref name=\"Skene\">[https://archive.org/details/johnoffordunschr00fordrich Skene, John of Fordun's Chronicle of the Scottish nation, Book IV, Chapters XXXII-XXXIV (32-34), pages 165-169]</ref> The Chronicle of the Kings of Scotts (''Cronica Regum Scottorum'', 12th century) shortens the reign to one year and four months (16 months).<ref name=\"CawleyAedh\"/><ref name=\"Skene2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XVkJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29 Skene, Chronicles of the Picts and Scots, p. 131]</ref> This source was a king-list compiled during the reign of [[William the Lion]] (reign 1165\u20131214), the last king mentioned in it.

Kenneth II himself was a '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm'''; his name could have been transferred to the killer of his successor by a faulty text.

'''Constantine, son of Culen''' was killed by '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm''' (see above) at ''[[Bertha (Perth)|Rathinveramon]]''. Constantine's body was transported for burial to [[Iona]]. An entry in the [[Chronicle of Melrose]] describes \"''King Constantine, Culen's son,  ... slain by the sword''\" at the mouth of  [[River Almond, Perthshire|Almond]] in Tegalere. Again the killer is reported as '''Kenneth, son of Malcolm'''.<ref name=\"Anderson2\"/> John of Fordun's narrative is more verbose.  According to it, Constantine and Kenneth, son of Malcolm met one day in Laudonia ([[Lothian]]), by the banks of the [[River Almond, Lothian|River Almond]]. They engaged in battle, resulting in great slaughter on both sides and the death of both leaders. The guards of Constantine fled to Gryme (Kenneth III), \"''colleague\"'' of their leader, allowing him to win the throne. However, news of the battle and its results reached Malcolm (II) in [[Cumbria]]. He learned of the death of his \"''uncle and the rest of his faithful friends\"'', and returned to gather reinforcements for his cause\u2014though he was defeated in his initial conflict against Gryme.<ref name=\"Skene\"/>\n\nJohn of Fordun consistently depicts Malcolm II holding Cumbria, emerging from it to combat Constantine III and Kenneth III (or his son Giric). In 1000, Malcolm reportedly defended Cumbria against the invasion of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]], [[List of English monarchs|King of England]].<ref name=\"Smyth3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 226]</ref> A relevant entry from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' confirms that the Danish fleet which regularly raided England departed in 1000. This sudden relief from attack \u00c6thelred used to gather his thoughts, resources, and armies: the fleet's departure in 1000 \"allowed \u00c6thelred to carry out a devastation of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], the motive for which is part of the lost history of the north.\"<ref name=\"Smyth3\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y65NxJaMtcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=Steathclyde&f=false Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 379.]</ref> But this indicates the limits to Constantine's (and Kenneth's) area of authority, and informs us that Cumbria/Strathclyde lay beyond them.<ref name=\"Smyth3\"/> The opponent of \u00c6thelred is not however specified by the Chronicle. [[Benjamin Hudson]] notes that John of Fordun was at times confused when depicting events of this period. The conflict depicted could actually be one between \u00c6thelred and Kenneth III, Scottish and Anglo-Saxon armies fighting over control of Strathclyde\u2014Aethelred wanting to restore Anglo-Saxon control in an area once conquered by [[Edmund I|Edmund the Elder]] (reigned 939-946), his grandfather. Perhaps he was desperately seeking to add some [[revenue]] to his treasury. Kenneth and the [[Scottish people|Scots]] were naturally unwilling to lose an area under their own rule for two generations.<ref name=\"Hudson\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uMtuva92HwwC&pg=PA226 Hudson, Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n: Irish and Scottish High-Kings of the Early Middle Ages, p. 218-219]</ref>\n\n==Location of death==\n\n[[James Young Simpson]], who had written several articles on archaeology, observed that there were contradictory accounts concerning the location of Constantine's death. While most accounts place the battle near the River Almond, there were two rivers of that name in Scotland, one in [[Perthshire]] and one in [[Lothian]]. [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] identified the one in Perthsire to have been the intended location. But John of Fordun, the [[Scotichronicon]], [[Hector Boece]], and [[George Buchanan]] all point to the one in Lothian. The [[Chronicle of Melrose]] places the battle near the [[River Avon (Falkirk)|River Avon]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] places it near the river \"Awyne\". [[John Lesley]] places it near the [[River Annan]], and considers it part of an ongoing invasion of Cumbria.<ref name=\"Simpson\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 136-139]</ref><ref name=\"Simpson2\">[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/simpson_james13.htm Sir James Young Simpson (biography) Appendix]. Listing of archaeological articles written by Simpson</ref>\n\nThere are also contradictions concerning the location of the battle in relation to the river. The Scotichronicon, Melrose, and Wyntoun placed the battle at the [[river source]]. Melrose also adding the word \"Tegalere\" to describe  the location. Which might be the same as the \"Inregale regens\" of the Scotichronicon and the \"Indegale\" of the ''Liber Dumblain''. Boece and Buchanan place the battle at a [[river mouth]], where the Almond enters the [[Firth of Forth]]. That is where [[Cramond]] is located, called \"Crawmond\" in some editions of Boece. The \"Nomina Regum Scottorum et Pictorum\", discovered by [[Robert Sibbald]] at the [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory]], place the death sites of both [[Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn]] and Constantine III at Rathveramoen (Rathinveramon). Which etymologically derives from \"Rath Inver Amoen\", the [[Ringfort|r\u00e1th]] at the mouth of the Amoen/Amon (the Almond). That is the fortress [[Bertha (Perth)|Bertha]] in Perth,<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> located at the mouth of the Almond. A location where the Almond joins the [[River Tay]], and in proximity to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].<ref name=\"Woolf2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=nPFY1DXNH9kC&pg=PA260 Woolf, Scotland, p. 260]</ref> Rathinveramon also lay at short distance from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. [[Monzievaird]], where Kenneth III was eventually killed, was about 15 miles from Perth.<ref name=\"Cannon\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=TYnfhTq2M7EC&pg=PA371 Cannon, A Dictionary of British History, p. 371]</ref> [[Forteviot]], connected to [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] and his death, is also located in [[Perthshire]].<ref name=\"Williams, Smyth, Kirby2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=jR376Dp1OFIC&pg=PA166 Williams, Smyth, and Kirby,  A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain: England, Scotland, and Wales, c. 500-c. 1050, p.166]</ref>\n\nAlex Woolf points that the [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]], reports another location for the death of Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn: the palace of Cinnbelathoir. Which was probably the same as the \"Bellathor\", mentioned alongside \"Rigmonath\" as the major settlements of their time. Rigmonath has been identified with Rigmonaid, another name for [[St Andrews]]. Since Rigmonath was a church-settlement, perhaps the same was true for Bellathor. Seeking for a likely location in the vicinity of Rathinveramon, Woolf suggests that Bellathor was an older name for Scone. The location was used for the inauguration ceremonies of kings, pointing at the significance of the area.<ref name=\"Woolf4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=7d1SP6ztlq0C&pg=PA89 Woolf, From Pictland to Alba, 789-1070, p. 103-105]</ref> Earlier the same area, including Forteviot, had served as the population centre of the southern [[Picts]]. The lack of fortification at Forteviot could indicate that it too served as a church site. One associated with the kings.<ref name=\"Woolf4\"/> Already in 728, there is mention of a Pictish royal stronghold at the hill of Moncrieffe, where the River Tay meets the [[River Earn]]. The location lies just outside Perth, 8&nbsp;km from Forteviot, close to both [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] and Scone. Suggesting that the area long served as a \"key royal centre\", though the central location switched over time. From Moncrieffe to Forteviot to Scone.<ref name=\"Fraser\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaliXwNMpFsC&pg=PA288 Fraser, From Caledonia to Pictland, p. 288]</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, there was a theory that the [[Cat Stane]] of [[Kirkliston]] could be connected to the final battle of Constantine III. The Reverend John Muckarsie alluded to this idea, in a text eventually collected in the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|Statistical Account of Scotland]] by [[Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet]]. In 1780, the founding meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] took place. Its founder [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan]] mentioned the idea in his opening [[discourse]]. He noted an extant transcription of the Cat Stane's text, reading: \"IN HOC TUM- JAC - CONSTAN- VIC- VICT\". Where \"Constan\" was understood to have been Constantine IV (III). The speech was recorded in [[The Scots Magazine]].<ref name=\"Simpson\"/><ref name=\"Simpson3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 123-125]</ref> The idea went that the Cat Stane was erected as a [[memorial]] for Constantine, at the location where the man lost his life in battle. The [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account]] went a bit further, suggesting that the stone marked the [[burial]] place of Constantine.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> Simpson strongly opposed this theory. Finding it unlikely that such a monument would be erected for Constantine the Bald, a king who fell in a civil war. A king with no family legacy. A king who was treated with contempt by primary sources. He examined other transcription of the texts, where the word \"Constan\" was absent. Dismissing the theory as based on a faulty reading of the original text.<ref name=\"Simpson4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=_jcGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136 Simpson, On the Cat-Stain, p. 139-140]</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Constantine III (Alba).jpg|thumb|upright|17th-century portrait, when he was reckoned as Constantine IV]]\nThe stanzas of [[The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]] covering Constantine III give him a mostly negative assessment: ''\"A king will take [the sovereignty], who will not be king; after him, Scotland will be nothing. It will be the weak following the strong; though true is what my lips relate. A king with reproach above his head; alas for Scotland during his short time! Feeble men will be about him, in the region of [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], of melodious shields. A year and a half (a bright space), that will be his whole reign; from taking [[Gaels]] (hostages?) he will go to death; he falls, his people fall. He will fight great battles in Scotland; by the disgrace of his head he will destroy colours. He will be in communion of battle, from [[Stirling]] to Abertay. ''\" Anderson suggested that this would be the area from Stirling to Tentsmuir (Abertay Sands), the traditional Scottish boundary with \"Danish [[Northumbria]]\"([[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]]).<ref name=\"Anderson2\"/><ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nBerch\u00e1n gave a negative portrayal of [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]] as well, calling him \"the [[Fratricide]]\", who  ''\"would bring danger on everyone ''\". Kenneth II  ''\"would attack his own people as well as his enemies ''\". Probably alluding to Kenneth killing members of the Scottish nobility, people who were related to him in various ways. Hudson suspects that further details on the killings of Kenneth II could be found in [[lost work]]s, part of an early Scottish literal tradition. A tradition which left only fragments in later works.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/><ref name=\"Hudson2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uMtuva92HwwC&pg=PA226 Hudson, Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n: Irish and Scottish High-Kings of the Early Middle Ages, p. 215]</ref> But Kenneth II is depicted as a strong king, while Constantine III is dismissed as a failure. The length of his reign (18 months) confirms that Constantine is the failed \"non-king\" intended. A king surrounded by weak men. The poem places his death by the [[River Tay]], though this is not necessarily a contradiction to other accounts of his death (which place it by river Almond). The Almond flows into the Tay in a location not far from Scone. A location which is also recorded as the place of death to a previous king, [[Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn]] (reigned 859-862).<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\nThe ominous verse which has Constantine fall with his people, might allude to the end of his family. As his line probably died with him. The name Grim/Gryme for his successor Kenneth III probably derives from \"greimm\" ([[Middle Irish]]: authority). Berch\u00e1n calls this man [[donn]]. As an adjective it means \"brown\", but as a noun the meaning changes to \"chief\" (prince, lord). Depicting him as stronger king.<ref name=\"Hudson\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nConstantine is not known to have any descendants and he was the last of the line of [[\u00c1ed of Scotland|\u00c1ed]] (\u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda) to have been king.<ref name=\"Smyth\"/> With his death, the rivalry between descendants of Causantin and \u00c1ed gave way to a rivalry between two new royal lines, both descended from Causantin. One line descended from Kenneth II and was represented by his son Malcolm II. The other line descended from his brother [[Dub, King of Scotland]] (reigned 962-967) and was represented by Kenneth III.<ref name=\"Smyth4\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&pg=PA226 Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000, p. 224-227]</ref>\n\n==Depictions in fiction==\n\n*Constantine III was depicted in two episodes of the animated television series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. The episodes depict the assassination of Kenneth II by Constantine,  and his rise to the throne. Constantine was also depicted in three issues of the ''[[Gargoyles (comic)|Gargoyles]]'' comic book series, covering his struggles against Kenneth III and Malcolm II, and ending at the Battle of Rathveramoen and his death at the hand of Kenneth. [[Gille Coemg\u00e1in of Moray]] is depicted fighting at Constantine's side.<ref name=\"GargoylesWiki\">{{harvnb|GargoylesWiki|2010|loc=[http://gargwiki.net/Constantine_III Constantine III]}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n''For primary sources see also '' '''External links''' ''below.''\n* [[Alan Orr Anderson|Anderson, Alan Orr]], ''Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500&ndash;1286''. 1922 edition, Oliver and Boyd.\n* [[Alan Orr Anderson|Anderson, Alan Orr]], ''Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500&ndash;1286'', volume 1.

Agne Wideheim [[Sweden]] 1918-2007.]]\nA '''tailor''' is a person who makes, repairs, or alters clothing professionally, especially suits and men's clothing.\n\nAlthough the term dates to the thirteenth century, ''tailor'' took on its modern sense in the late eighteasdenth century, and now refers to makers of men's and women's [[suit (clothing)|suits]], [[coat (clothing)|coat]]s, [[trousers]], and similar garments, usually of [[wool]], [[linen]], or [[silk]].\n\nThe term refers to a set of specific hand and machine sewing and pressing techniques that are unique to the construction of traditional jackets. Retailers of tailored suits often take their services internationally, traveling to various cities, allowing the client to be measured locally.\n\nTraditional tailoring is called \"[[bespoke tailoring]]\" in the United Kingdom, where the heart of the trade is London's [[Savile Row  tailoring]], and \"custom tailoring\" in the United States and [[Hong Kong]]. This is unlike [[made to measure]] which uses pre-existing patterns. A bespoke  garment or suit is completely original and unique to each customer.\n\nFamous fictional tailors include the tailor in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]] '' and ''[[The Valiant Little Tailor]]''. A more recent example is [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Tailor of Panama]]''.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:A tailor fitting a customer (Belgrade, 1937).jpg|left|thumb|upright=.8|Fitting a customer]]\n[[Image:TailoringFirstFitFront01.jpg|right|thumb|Tailoring first fitting]]\nAs the tailoring profession has evolved, so too have the methods of tailoring. There are a number of distinctive business models which modern tailors may practice. While some may practice many, there are others who will practice only one or two.\n===Local tailoring===\nLocal tailoring is as the name implies. Typically the tailor is met locally and the garment produced locally. This method enables the tailor to take professional measurements, assess posture and body shape to make unique modifications to the garment. Local tailors will typically have a showroom or shopfront allowing clients to choose fabrics from samples or return the garment easily should it require further modification.  This is the most traditional form of tailoring. [[Hong Kong Tailors]] and London are the most famous for high quality [[bespoke]] tailoring, in average it takes about 2 to 3 fittings and about 50 to 70 working hours to handmake one suit.\n\n===Distance tailoring===\n[[File:House-of-dapper-nl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of House of Dapper, a tailor based in [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houseofdapper.nl|title=House of Dapper tailors|last=|first=|date=2019|website=House of Dapper|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:John's.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Cloth merchant|Clothier]] and tailor in the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]]]\nDistance tailoring involves ordering a garment from an out-of-town tailor enabling cheaper labour to be used. In practice this can now be done on a global scale via e-commerce websites. Unlike local tailoring, customers must take their own measurements, fabric selection must be made from a photo and if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped.  Today, the most common platform for distance tailoring is via online tailors.\n\nOnline tailors sometimes offer to pay for needed alterations at a local tailor.  Another new option is the concept where a free test suit is made to the provided measurements and shipped to the customer first.  The test suit can be tried on and worn to see where any adjustments are wanted.  The final suit is then tailored to the new specifications provided by the test suit fitting.\n\n===Traveling tailor===\nUnlike tailors who do distance tailoring, traveling tailors provide a more personal service to their customers and give the customers an opportunity to see the fabric samples and meet the tailor in person. Traveling tailors travel between cities and station in a local luxury hotel for a short period of time to meet and provide the same tailoring services they would provide in their local store. In the hotel, the customer will be able to select the fabric from samples and the tailor will take the measurements himself. The order then will be shipped to the customer within 3\u20134 weeks time. Unlike local tailoring, if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped. Today, most traveling tailors are from Hong Kong, traveling to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Japan.\n\n==Related terms==\n[[File:Brownell's trouser button.jpg|upright|thumb|Vintage tailor's button from [[Hobart, Tasmania]]]]\n[[File:Zackenschere.jpg|thumb|[[Pinking shears]]]]\n* A ''tailor-made'' is a man's suit consisting of a (usually) [[woolen]] or [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] [[coat (clothhooting)|coat]] and [[pants]]; the name arose during the [[Edwardian period]].\n* As an adjective, ''tailor-made'' (from the second half of the twentieth century usually simplified to ''tailored'') refers to [[clothing]] made by or in the style of clothes made by a tailor, characterized by simplicity of [[cut (clothing)|cut]] and [[trim (sewing)|trim]] and fine (often hand) finishing; as a women's clothing style ''tailored'' as opposed to [[dressmaker]].\n*''Rodeo tailor'' is a term for a creator of the flamboyant costumes typical of [[country music|country and western]] musicians, characterized by extensive hand [[embroidery]], an abundance of [[rhinestone]]s, and [[cowboy]] details such as [[pearl]] [[Snap fastener|snaps]] and [[western wear|arrowhead pockets]].\n* In some documents, tailor means ''adjust'', and tailoring means ''adjusting''.\n\n'''''Sewing professional''''' is the most general term for those who make their living by sewing, teaching, writing about sewing, or retailing sewing supplies.

The police then mutinied, prompting Gqozo to resign on 22 March. The [[Transitional Executive Council]] (TEC) appointed two administrators, who took control of the homeland to ensure security until the elections could be held the following month. The TEC also blocked the South African government from deploying the paramilitary Internal Stability Unit (ISU) of the South African Police force, as the unit was suspected of fomenting violence in other parts of the country, and after the Ciskei military had threatened to open fire on the ISU if it entered the territory.\n\nCiskei and all of the other homelands were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994, after the first post-[[apartheid]] elections.

The [[Transitional Executive Council]] (TEC) appointed two administrators, who took control of the homeland to ensure security until the elections could be held the following month. The TEC also blocked the South African government from deploying the paramilitary Internal Stability Unit (ISU) of the South African Police force, as the unit was suspected of fomenting violence in other parts of the country, and after the Ciskei military had threatened to open fire on the ISU if it entered the territory.\n\nCiskei and all of the other homelands were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994, after the first post-[[apartheid]] elections. Along with Transkei, Ciskei became part of the new [[Eastern Cape Province]], with its capital becoming the capital of the new province, and the former territory of the Ciskei forming parts of the [[Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality]], the [[Chris Hani District Municipality]] and the [[Amathole District Municipality]], as of 2016.<ref name=\"mTechCart\"/>\n\n==Districts in 1991==\nDistricts of the province and population at the 1991 census.<ref name=BSTNdist>{{cite web|title=Census > 1991 > Ciskei > Variable Description > ... > District code|url=http://interactive.statssa.gov.za:8282/webview/|publisher=Statistics South Africa - Nesstar WebView|accessdate=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619202856/http://interactive.statssa.gov.za:8282/webview/|archive-date=19 June 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n* [[Alice, Eastern Cape|Alice]]: 43,452 \t\n* [[Whittlesea, Eastern Cape|Whittlesea]]: 50,199 \t\n* [[Keiskammahoek]]: 32,740 \t\n* [[Mdantsane]]: 105,117 \t\n* [[Middledrift, Eastern Cape|Middledrift]]: 37,979 \t\n* [[Peddie, Eastern Cape|Peddie]]: 52,245 \t\n* [[Zwelitsha]]: 142,779 \t\n* [[Mpofu]]: 13,056\n\n==Law enforcement and Defence==\n* Founded in 1981 the [[Ciskei Defence Force]] consisted of two battalions and an Air-wing.\n* [[Ciskei Police]]\n* [[Ciskei Police - Law Enforcement Division]]\n* [[Ciskei Prisons Service]]\n* [[Ciskei Traffic Force]]\n\n==Notable persons==\n\n*[[Steve Biko|Bantu Stephen Biko]], former political activist, founder and the president of [[Black Consciousness Movement]]\n*[[Joshua Oupa Gqozo]], former Ciskei's President\n*[[Thandatha Jongilizwe Mabandla]], former Ciskei's President and Ciskei's Chief Justice\n*[[Membathisi Mdladlana|Membathisi Mphumzi Shepherd Mdladlana]], former minister of labour, politician and ambassador in [[Canada]]\n*[[Wilton Mkwayi|Wilton Zimasile Mkwayi]], former anti-apartheid activist and member of [[ANC]]\n*[[Griffiths Mxenge|Griffiths Mlungisi Mxenge]], former political activist and member of ANC\n*[[Bulelani Ngcuka]], former NPA director 1999\u20132004\n*[[Looksmart Khulile Ngudle]], former political activist and member of ANC\n*[[Lennox Leslie Wongamu Sebe]], former Ciskei's President and long-serving President\n*[[Xhanti Charles Sebe]], former Ciskei's Acting President\n*[[Archibald 'Archie' Mncedisi Sibeko]], former anti-apartheid activist and member of ANC\n\n==See also==\n* [[Transkei]]\n* [[Fengu people]]\n* [[List of heads of state of Ciskei]]\n* [[Vice President of Ciskei]]\n* [[Ciskei Defence Force]]\n\n==Books on Ciskei==\n* Mager, A.K.

(Provincials who aspired to [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] gained it when [[Honesta missio|honourably discharged]] from the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].) The Roman army, for most of the Imperial period, consisted mostly of auxiliaries rather than legions.<ref>Data in: Goldsworthy, Adrian (2003).

See table in article \"Auxiliaries (Roman military)\" for compilation of this data.</ref>\n\n==Longevity ==\nMany of the legions founded before 40 BC were still active until at least the fifth century, notably [[Legio V Macedonica]], which was founded by [[Augustus]] in 43 BC and was in Egypt in the seventh century during the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]].\n\n==Overview of typical organization and strength==\n\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n[[File:Roman Legionaries-MGR Lyon-IMG 1050.JPG|thumb|Imperial Roman legionaries in tight formation, a relief from [[Glanum]], a Roman town in what is now [[southern France]] that was inhabited from 27 BC to 260 AD (when it was sacked by invading [[Alemanni]])]]\nBecause legions were not permanent units until the [[Marian reforms]] (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. The republican legions were composed of levied men that paid for their own equipment and thus the structure of the Roman army at this time reflected the society, and at any time there would be four consular legions (with command divided between the two ruling consuls) and in time of war extra legions could be levied. Toward the end of the 2nd century BC, Rome started to experience manpower shortages brought about by property and financial qualifications to join the army. This prompted consul [[Gaius Marius]] to remove property qualifications and decree that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for service in the Roman army with equipment and rewards for fulfilling years of service provided by the state. The Roman army became a volunteer, professional and standing army which extended service beyond Roman citizens but also to non-citizens who could sign on as [[Auxilia|''auxillia'']] (auxiliaries) and were rewarded [[Roman citizenship]] upon completion of service and all the rights and privileges that entailed. In the time of [[Augustus]], there were nearly 50 upon his succession but this was reduced to about 25\u201335 permanent standing legions and this remained the figure for most of the empire's history.\n\n==Evolution ==\nThe legion evolved from 3,000 men in the [[Roman Republic]] to over 5,200 men in the [[Roman Empire]], consisting of [[centuria|centuries]] as the basic units. Until the middle of the first century, ten [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (about 500 men) made up a Roman legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with six centuries at 80 men each) with the first cohort being of double strength (five double-strength centuries with 160 men each). By the fourth century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. This had come about as the large formation legion and auxiliary unit, 10,000 men, was broken down into smaller units - originally temporary detachments - to cover more territory.  In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller. In terms of organisation and function, the Republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian [[phalanx]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Size==\nThe size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 [[equites]] (drawn from the wealthier classes&nbsp;\u2013 in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the republican period of Rome (the infantry were split into 10 [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] each of four [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of 120 legionaries), to 5,200 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Roman army|Military history of ancient Rome|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n\n=== Roman kings (to c. 500 BC) ===\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n\nIn the period before the raising of the ''legio'' and the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Republic, forces are described as being organized into ''[[Centuria|centuries]]'' of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or raised them. Such independent organization persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalized as a [[centurion]]), [[Optio|second in command]] and [[Aquilifer|standard bearer]] are referenced in this early period.\n\nRome's early period is undocumented and shrouded in myths, but those myths tell that during the rule of [[Servius Tullius]], the [[census]] (from [[Latin]]: ''cense\u014d'' \u2013 accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organized into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or ''legio'' (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship; during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service. These individuals would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.\n\n=== Roman Republic (509\u2013107 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n\nAt some point, possibly in the beginning of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman Republic#Overthrow of the kings|kings were overthrown]], the ''legio'' was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. In 494 BC, when three foreign threats emerged, the dictator [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] raised ten legions which [[Livy]] says was a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.30</ref>\n\nAlso, some warfare was still conducted by Roman forces outside the legionary structure, the most famous example being the campaign in 479 BC by the clan army of gens Fabia against the Etruscan city of Veii (in which the clan was annihilated). Legions became more formally organized in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions each.\n\nIn the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome's Italian allies were required to provide approximately ten cohorts (auxilia were not organized into legions) to support each Roman Legion.\n\nIn the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:\n* ''[[Equites]]'' (cavalry): The [[cavalry]] was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more [[lance]]s. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of ''circa'' 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men. These men were commanded by [[Decurion (military)|decurions]]. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the ''hastati'' or the ''equites''. In battle, they were used to disrupt and [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before [[stirrup]]s.<ref>Mccall, Jeremiah B. ''The Cavalry of the Roman Republic: Cavalry Combat and Elite Reputations in the Middle and Late Republic.'' (New York, Routledge, 2002) pp. 53ff</ref>\n* ''[[Velites]]'' ([[light infantry]]): The ''velites'' were mainly poorer citizens who could not afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as [[skirmishers]] \u2013 javelin-throwers, who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the [[velites]] were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organization or formation.\n* [[Heavy infantry]]: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and [[pilum]], a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 BC, the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the [[gladius]], a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (''[[caligae]]'') were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Prior to the Marian reforms (see below), the heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:\n** The ''[[hastati]]'' (sing. ''hastatus'') consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.\n** The ''[[principes]]'' (sing. ''princeps'') These were the more experienced soldiers, often better equipped than the Hastati, and having more experience on the battlefield, they would take up the second line in the battle in the event the Hastati failed or fled. They were the second wave in an early Republican Legion before the military reforms of Marius.\n** The ''[[triarii]]'' (sing. ''triarius'') were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The ''triarii'' served primarily as reserves or [[barrier troops]] designed to backstop the ''hastati'' and ''principes'', and were equipped with long ''[[Hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (spears) rather than the ''pilum'' and ''gladius'' (the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a [[phalanx formation]]. The sight of an advancing armored formation of ''triarii'' legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating ''hastati'' and ''principes'' troops. ''Ad triarios redisse'' \u2013 ''To fall back upon the triarii'' was a Roman [[idiom]] \u2013 meaning to use one's last resort.\n\nEach of these three lines was subdivided into (usually 10) chief tactical units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]. A maniple consisted of two [[Centuria|centuries]] and was commanded by the senior of the two [[centurion]]s. At this time, each century of hastati and principes consisted of 60 men; a century of triarii was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican (\"manipular\") legion a nominal strength of about 4,500 men.\n\n=== Late Republic (107\u201330 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\n[[File:Legion Task ORG.png|thumb|500px|Visual representation of the post Marian Reform Legion showing size and disposition for Infantry formations]]\n''See also [[List of Roman legions]] for details of notable late Republican legions''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\nThe Marian reforms (of Gaius Marius) enlarged the centuries to 80 men, and grouped them into six-century \"cohorts\" (rather than two-century maniples). Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (''contubernia'') of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and [[cooking pot]].\n\nFollowing the reforms of the general [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in the 2nd century BC, the legions took on the second, narrower meaning that is familiar in the popular imagination as close-order citizen heavy infantry.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd century BC, [[Gaius Marius]] reformed the previously ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled [[Julius Caesar]] to cross the [[Rubicon]] with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic and early Empire are often called ''Marian'' legions. Following the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the ''Principes'': armed with two heavy javelins called ''pila'' (singular ''[[pilum]]''), the short sword called ''gladius'', chain mail (''[[lorica hamata]]''), helmet and rectangular shield (''[[scutum (shield)|scutum]]'').\n\nThe role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called ''Auxilia''. ''Auxilia'' contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, [[light infantry]] or ''[[velites]]'', and labourers. There was also a [[reconnaissance]] [[squad]] of 10 or more light [[mounted infantry]] called ''[[speculatores]]'' who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of [[military intelligence]] service.\n\nAs part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]''. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries and in the case of the first cohort 5 double strength centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an ''[[optio]]''. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. Ranking within the legion was based on length of service, with the senior Centurion commanding the first century of the first cohort; he was called the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (First Spear), and reported directly to the superior officers (legates and tribuni). All career soldiers could be promoted to the higher ranks in recognition of exceptional acts of bravery or valour. A newly promoted junior Centurion would be assigned to the sixth century of the tenth cohort and slowly progressed through the ranks from there.\n\nEvery legion had a large baggage train, which included 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25\u201330&nbsp;kg (50\u201360 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed ''Marius' Mules'' because of the amount of gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from the main body of the legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.\n\nA typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 11,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries. During the Later Roman Empire, the legion was reduced in size to 1,000 to allow for easier provisioning and to expand the regions under surveillance. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; [[Julius Caesar]]'s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.\n\nTactics were not very different from the past, but their effectiveness was largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.\n\n[[Image:Centurio 70 aC - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor as a Roman centurion, ''c.'' 70.]]\n[[Image:Roman legionaire in lorica segmentata.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, showing a Roman [[Legionary|''miles'']], (2nd century).]]\n\nAfter the Marian reforms and throughout the history of Rome's Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC, the threat of the legions under a [[demagogue]] was recognized. [[Roman Governor|Governors]] were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When [[Julius Caesar]] broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the [[Rubicon]] into Italy, he precipitated a [[constitutional crisis]]. This crisis and the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] under [[Augustus]] in 27 BC.\n\n[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|left|100px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117\u201338), showing the '''legions''' deployed in 125]]\n\n=== Early Empire (27 BC\u2013AD 284) ===\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\n''See  [[List of Roman legions#Early Empire legions|List of Roman legions of the early Empire]]''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\n[[File:Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 14 AD.Source: http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg]]\n\nGenerals, during the recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. During this time, there was a high incidence of ''Gemina'' (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a [[legatus]] and six duces). At the end of the civil war against [[Mark Antony]], Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]], in which 3 legions were completely destroyed by the [[Germanics]]).\n\nBeside streamlining the army, Augustus also regulated the soldiers' pay. At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the [[Praetorian Guard]] along with a permanent [[Roman Navy|navy]] where served the ''liberti'', or freed slaves.\nThe legions also became permanent at this time, and not recruited for particular campaigns. They were also allocated to static bases with permanent ''[[castra]] legionaria'' (legionary fortresses).\n\nAugustus' military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions (hence the wry remark of the philosopher [[Favorinus]] that ''It is ill arguing with the master of 30 legions''). With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops (according to Tacitus), the total force available to a legion commander during the [[Pax Romana]] probably ranged from 11,000 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. By the time of the emperor [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], 193-211, the auxiliaries may have composed 55 to 60% of the army, 250,000 of 447,000. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000\u201316,000 or about the size of a modern [[Division (military)|division]].\n\nThroughout the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] or take it away. For example, the defeat of [[Vitellius]] in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] was decided when the [[Danube|Danubian]] legions chose to support [[Vespasian]].\n\nIn the empire, the legion was standardized, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a ''[[legatus]]'' or ''legate''. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three-year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected ''military tribunes'' \u2013 five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the ''praefectus castrorum'' (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.\n\n=== Later Empire (from 284 AD) ===\n{{Main|Late Roman army}}\n{{See also|List of Roman legions}}\n[[File:Roman soldier end of third century northern province - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, portraying a legionary at the end of the 3rd century]]\n[[File:Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 212 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg |title=Map |website=.hypotheses.org}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the [[Late Antiquity|Later Roman Empire]], the number of legions was increased and the [[Military establishment of the Roman empire|Roman Army]] expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the [[Tetrarchy]], although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite ''legiones palatinae'' created by [[Diocletian]] and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old Legions. The earliest ''legiones palatinae'' were the ''Lanciarii'', ''Joviani'', ''[[Herculians|Herculiani]]'' and ''Divitenses''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]]. In addition to the elite ''[[palatini (Roman military)|palatini]]'', other legions called ''[[comitatenses]]'' and ''[[pseudocomitatenses]]'', along with the ''[[auxilia palatina]]'', provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The [[Notitia Dignitatum]] lists 25 ''legiones palatinae'', 70 ''legiones comitatenses'', 47 ''legiones pseudocomitatenses'' and 111 ''auxilia palatina'' in the field armies, and a further 47 ''legiones'' in the frontier armies.<ref>Totals from summary of Notitia Dignitatum in Richardot, Philippe, ''La fin de l'arm\u00e9e romaine 284\u2013476'' [3rd ed.] Economica, 2005. {{ISBN|2-7178-4861-4}}.</ref> Legion names such as ''[[Honorius (emperor)|Honoriani]]'' and ''[[Gratian]]enses'' found in the Notitia suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from ''[[vexillatio]]nes'' or from old legions. In addition, there were 24 vexillationes palatini, 73 vexillationes comitatenses; 305 other units in the Eastern limitanei and 181 in the Western limitanei.<ref>Jones, Later Roman Empire, pp. 1449\u201350</ref>\n\nAccording to the late Roman writer [[Vegetius]]' ''[[De Re Militari]]'', each century had a [[ballista]] and each cohort had an [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]], giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers, each manned by 10 ''libritors'' (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps ([[castra]]) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as [[field artillery]] during battles or in support of river crossings.\n\nDespite a number of reforms, the Legion system survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and was continued in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until around 7th century, when reforms begun by Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the increasing need for soldiers around the Empire resulted in the [[Theme system]]. Despite this, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions, and were maintained with similar level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization.\n\n==Legionary ranks==\nAside from the rank and file [[legionary]] (who received the base wage of 10 [[as (coin)|ass\u0113s]] a day or 225 [[denarius|denarii]] a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the Marian reforms (104 BC) until the military reforms of [[Diocletian#Economic and military reforms|Diocletian]] (c. 290).\n\n===Senior officers===\n* '''''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''''', '''Imperial Legate''': The commander of two or more legions. The Imperial Legate also served as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of [[Roman Senate|Senatorial rank]], the Imperial Legate was appointed by the Emperor and usually held command for 3 or 4 years. In the present time, an Imperial Legate would be called a General.\n* '''''[[Legatus legionis]]''''', '''Legion Legate''': The overall legion commander. The post was usually filled by a [[Roman Senate|senator]], appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a [[Roman province]] with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial [[Roman governor|governor]]. In such circumstances, the Legatus was dual-hatted as both Legion Legate and Imperial Legate. The Legion Legate also served as commander of the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] attached to the legion though they were not formally a part of the legion's command structure.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribunus laticlavius]]''''', '''Broad Band Tribune''': Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience he was not the actual second in command in battle, but if the legate died he would take command of the legion.\n* '''''[[Praefectus castrorum]]''''', '''Camp Prefect''': The Camp Prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the ''tribunii'' whom he outranked, and who previously had served as ''primus pilus'' and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of [[auxilia]]ires.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribuni angusticlavii]]''''', '''Narrow Band Tribunes''': Each legion had five lower ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers.<ref>Bowman, Garnsey, Rathbone (eds) ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 11'' pp. 326\u201327</ref> This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man's political career (see [[cursus honorum]]).<ref>Birley, Anthony R. ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor.'' (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1989) p. 40</ref>\n\n===Centurions===\nThe rank of [[centurion]] was an officer grade that included many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort's first century was known as a ''pilus prior'' and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the four other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as ''primi ordines''.\n\n[[File:Centurion 2 Boulogne Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|160px|A historical reenactor in Roman centurion costume]]\n\nThe six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:\n* The forward hastati (forward spears)\n* The rear hastati (rear spears)\n* The forward principes (forward principal line)\n* The rear principes (rear principal line)\n* The forward triarii (forward third line)\n* The rear triarii (rear third line)\n\nThe centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.\n* '''''[[Primus pilus]]''''', literally '''First File''': The ''Primus Pilus'' was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a \"front spear\" and a \"back spear\" century.) The primus pilus had a chance of later becoming a ''Praefectus Castrorum''. When the primus pilus retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. Primus Pilus were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.\n* ''Pilus prior'': The \"front file\" centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of their entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.\n* ''Primi ordines'': The \"ranks of the first [cohort]\" were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.\n* ''Other centurions'': Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage''.\n\n===Lower ranks===\n* ''[[Optio]]'': One for each centurion (59\u201360), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were paid twice the basic wage. Equivalent to a modern [[First Sergeant]].<ref name=\"CCW20\">Caesar's Civil War, Adrian Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKTABZiThz4C&pg=PA20 p. 20]</ref>\n* ''[[Tesserarius]]'': (Guard commander) One for each century. They acted as seconds to the Optios and were paid one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard. Equivalent to a modern [[Staff Sergeant]].\n* ''[[Decurion (military)|Decurion]]'': Commanded a cavalry unit (''[[turma]]'') of 10 to 30 ''eques legionis''.<ref name=\"CCW20\"/>\n* ''[[Decanus]]'': Commanded a ''[[contubernium]]'' or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants,  equivalent to a [[Sergeant]] or [[Corporal]].  A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a [[Quaternion (disambiguation)|Quaternion]].\n\n===Special duty posts===\n* ''[[Aquilifer]]'': A single position within the legion. The aquilifer was the legion's [[Heraldic standard|standard]]\u2013 or [[Aquila (Roman)|''Aquila'']] (eagle)\u2013 bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the aquila was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Signifer]]'': Each century had a ''signifer'' (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] the 1st century's ''signifer'' would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the ''centurial signum'', a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the ''signum'', the ''signifer'' also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Cornicen]]'' (Horn blower): Worked hand in hand with the signifer drawing the attention of the men to the centurial signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Imaginifer]]'': A special position from the time of [[Augustus]] onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops' loyalty to him. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Immunes]]'': Immunes were legionary soldiers who possessed specialized skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. [[Engineer]]s, [[artillerymen]], [[musician]]s, clerks, [[quartermaster]]s, drill and weapons instructors, [[carpenter]]s, [[hunter]]s, medical staff and [[military police]] were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.\n* ''[[Evocatus]]'': A veteran of the Roman army who had earned his [[Roman military diploma|military diploma]] for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.\n* ''[[Duplicarius]]'': A special pay grade that could also be awarded regardless of rank, received double the basic pay.\n\n==Pay==\nFrom the time of [[Gaius Marius]] onwards, legionaries received 225 ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' a year (equal to 900 [[Sestertius|''Sestertii'']]); this basic rate remained unchanged until [[Domitian]], who increased it to 300 denarii. <!-- need info on how long this timespan was? --> In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of [[Septimius Severus]], who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the [[P.O.W.|prisoners of war]] and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.\n\nAll legionary soldiers would also receive a ''praemia'' ([[veterans' benefits]]) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 ''denarii'' from the time of [[Augustus]]) and/or a plot of good [[Farming in ancient Rome|farmland]] (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under [[Caracalla]], the ''praemia'' increased to 5,000 ''denarii''.\n\n==Symbols==\nFrom 104 BC onwards, each legion used an [[aquila (Roman)|aquila]] (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as [[aquilifer]], and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.<ref name=\"Authors2015\">{{cite book|author=Several Authors|title=History of The Roman Legions: History of Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLQ2CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1069|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Self-Publish|pages=1069\u2013|id=GGKEY:DXPWT430TXP}}</ref>\n[[File:Roman soldiers with aquilifer signifer centurio 70 aC.jpg|thumb|Reenacters portraying Roman legionaries of [[Legio XV Apollinaris]].]]\nIn ''Gallic War'' (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55 BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]] threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.\n\nWith the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called [[imaginifer]], whose role was to carry a pike with the ''imago'' (image, sculpture) of the emperor as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nEach legion, furthermore, had a ''[[vexillifer]]'' who carried a ''vexillum'' or ''signum'', with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, ''[[vexillatio]]nes''. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.\n\nCivilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an arrow without a head. This was considered a great honour and would bring the recipient much prestige.\n\n==Discipline==\n{{Main|Roman military decorations and punishments}}\n\nThe military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess [[Disciplina]], whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.\n\n===Minor punishments===\n* '''Castigatio''' \u2013 being hit by the centurion with his staff or ''animadversio fustium'' (Tac. Annals I, 23)\n* \u2013 ''Reduction of rations'' or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration\n* '''Pecuniaria mulcta''' \u2013 Reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance\n*\u2013 ''Flogging'' in front of the century, cohort or legion\n* \u2013 ''Whipping'' with the ''[[flagrum]]'' (''flagellum'', ''flagella''), or \"short whip\" \u2013 a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The \"short whip\" was used by slave volunteers, ''volones'', who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.\n* '''[[Gradus deiectio]]''' \u2013 Reduction in rank\n* '''[[Missio ignominiosa]]''' \u2013 Dishonourable discharge\n* \u2013 Loss of ''time in service'' advantages\n* '''[[Militiae mutatio]]''' \u2013 Relegation to inferior service or duties.\n* '''[[Munerum indictio]]''' \u2013 Additional duties\n\n===Major punishments===\n* ''[[Fustuarium]]'' \u2013 a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by [[cudgel]]s, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of ''fustuarium'' who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the [[Tribune]] would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The Tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the [[Fustuarium]]. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=The Histories of Polybius: Fragments of Book VI p.357|last=Edwards|first=H.

Carthaginians' [[quinquereme]]), as well as military units, such as [[cataphract|heavy mounted cavalry]] and [[horse archer|mounted archers]] ([[Parthia]]ns and [[Numidians]]).\n* Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents. Over time, the legions effectively handled challenges ranging from cavalry, to guerrillas, and to siege warfare.\n* Roman discipline (cf. [[decimation (Roman army)]]), organization and systematization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, field fortification etc.\n* The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents. Wars with Carthage and the Parthians and most notably, the campaigns against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], illustrate this.\n* Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.\n* The influence of Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n* Strict, and more importantly, uniform discipline made commanding, maintaining, and replacing Roman legionaries a much more consistent exercise.\n* Roman military equipment (cf. [[Roman military personal equipment]]), particularly armor, was more withstanding and far more ubiquitous, especially in the late Republican and Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.\n* Roman engineering skills were second to none in ancient Europe, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications (cf. [[Sudis (stake)|sudis]], [[castra]]), was another major advantage for the Roman legions.\n* Roman military training focused on the more effective thrusting of the sword rather than the slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)]]\n* [[Early Roman army]]\n* [[Imperial Roman army]]\n* [[Late Roman army]]\n* [[Legionary]]\n* [[List of Roman wars]]\n* [[List of Roman battles]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[List of Roman legions]]\n* [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Marian Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army of the mid-Republic]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structural history of the Roman military]]\n* For a more detailed analysis, as well as the Romans in battle, see the articles [[Roman infantry tactics]] and [[Roman military personal equipment]].\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah19101/full ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient History'', Legions, history and location of]\n* ''History of the Art of War.

J. (1995): The Beginnings of Rome</ref> The subsequent organization of legions varied greatly over time but legions were typically composed of around five thousand soldiers. During much of the [[Roman Republic|republican era]], a legion was divided into three lines of ten ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]''. In the late republic and much of the imperial period (from about 100 BC), a legion was divided into ten [[cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]], each of six (or five) centuries. Legions also included a small ''[[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]]'', or cavalry, unit. By the third century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller.

(Provincials who aspired to [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]] gained it when [[Honesta missio|honourably discharged]] from the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].) The Roman army, for most of the Imperial period, consisted mostly of auxiliaries rather than legions.<ref>Data in: Goldsworthy, Adrian (2003).

See table in article \"Auxiliaries (Roman military)\" for compilation of this data.</ref>\n\n==Longevity ==\nMany of the legions founded before 40 BC were still active until at least the fifth century, notably [[Legio V Macedonica]], which was founded by [[Augustus]] in 43 BC and was in Egypt in the seventh century during the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]].\n\n==Overview of typical organization and strength==\n\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n[[File:Roman Legionaries-MGR Lyon-IMG 1050.JPG|thumb|Imperial Roman legionaries in tight formation, a relief from [[Glanum]], a Roman town in what is now [[southern France]] that was inhabited from 27 BC to 260 AD (when it was sacked by invading [[Alemanni]])]]\nBecause legions were not permanent units until the [[Marian reforms]] (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. The republican legions were composed of levied men that paid for their own equipment and thus the structure of the Roman army at this time reflected the society, and at any time there would be four consular legions (with command divided between the two ruling consuls) and in time of war extra legions could be levied. Toward the end of the 2nd century BC, Rome started to experience manpower shortages brought about by property and financial qualifications to join the army. This prompted consul [[Gaius Marius]] to remove property qualifications and decree that all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for service in the Roman army with equipment and rewards for fulfilling years of service provided by the state. The Roman army became a volunteer, professional and standing army which extended service beyond Roman citizens but also to non-citizens who could sign on as [[Auxilia|''auxillia'']] (auxiliaries) and were rewarded [[Roman citizenship]] upon completion of service and all the rights and privileges that entailed. In the time of [[Augustus]], there were nearly 50 upon his succession but this was reduced to about 25\u201335 permanent standing legions and this remained the figure for most of the empire's history.\n\n==Evolution ==\nThe legion evolved from 3,000 men in the [[Roman Republic]] to over 5,200 men in the [[Roman Empire]], consisting of [[centuria|centuries]] as the basic units. Until the middle of the first century, ten [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (about 500 men) made up a Roman legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with six centuries at 80 men each) with the first cohort being of double strength (five double-strength centuries with 160 men each). By the fourth century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. This had come about as the large formation legion and auxiliary unit, 10,000 men, was broken down into smaller units - originally temporary detachments - to cover more territory.  In the fourth century AD, [[East Roman army|East Roman]] [[border guard]] legions (''[[limitanei]]'') may have become even smaller. In terms of organisation and function, the Republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian [[phalanx]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Size==\nThe size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 [[equites]] (drawn from the wealthier classes&nbsp;\u2013 in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the republican period of Rome (the infantry were split into 10 [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] each of four [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of 120 legionaries), to 5,200 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Roman army|Military history of ancient Rome|Structural history of the Roman military}}\n\n=== Roman kings (to c. 500 BC) ===\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n\nIn the period before the raising of the ''legio'' and the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Republic, forces are described as being organized into ''[[Centuria|centuries]]'' of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or raised them. Such independent organization persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalized as a [[centurion]]), [[Optio|second in command]] and [[Aquilifer|standard bearer]] are referenced in this early period.\n\nRome's early period is undocumented and shrouded in myths, but those myths tell that during the rule of [[Servius Tullius]], the [[census]] (from [[Latin]]: ''cense\u014d'' \u2013 accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organized into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or ''legio'' (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship; during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service. These individuals would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.\n\n=== Roman Republic (509\u2013107 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n\nAt some point, possibly in the beginning of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman Republic#Overthrow of the kings|kings were overthrown]], the ''legio'' was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. In 494 BC, when three foreign threats emerged, the dictator [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] raised ten legions which [[Livy]] says was a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.30</ref>\n\nAlso, some warfare was still conducted by Roman forces outside the legionary structure, the most famous example being the campaign in 479 BC by the clan army of gens Fabia against the Etruscan city of Veii (in which the clan was annihilated). Legions became more formally organized in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions each.\n\nIn the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome's Italian allies were required to provide approximately ten cohorts (auxilia were not organized into legions) to support each Roman Legion.\n\nIn the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:\n* ''[[Equites]]'' (cavalry): The [[cavalry]] was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more [[lance]]s. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of ''circa'' 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men. These men were commanded by [[Decurion (military)|decurions]]. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the ''hastati'' or the ''equites''. In battle, they were used to disrupt and [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before [[stirrup]]s.<ref>Mccall, Jeremiah B. ''The Cavalry of the Roman Republic: Cavalry Combat and Elite Reputations in the Middle and Late Republic.'' (New York, Routledge, 2002) pp. 53ff</ref>\n* ''[[Velites]]'' ([[light infantry]]): The ''velites'' were mainly poorer citizens who could not afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as [[skirmishers]] \u2013 javelin-throwers, who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the [[velites]] were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organization or formation.\n* [[Heavy infantry]]: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and [[pilum]], a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 BC, the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the [[gladius]], a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (''[[caligae]]'') were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Prior to the Marian reforms (see below), the heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:\n** The ''[[hastati]]'' (sing. ''hastatus'') consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.\n** The ''[[principes]]'' (sing. ''princeps'') These were the more experienced soldiers, often better equipped than the Hastati, and having more experience on the battlefield, they would take up the second line in the battle in the event the Hastati failed or fled. They were the second wave in an early Republican Legion before the military reforms of Marius.\n** The ''[[triarii]]'' (sing. ''triarius'') were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The ''triarii'' served primarily as reserves or [[barrier troops]] designed to backstop the ''hastati'' and ''principes'', and were equipped with long ''[[Hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (spears) rather than the ''pilum'' and ''gladius'' (the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a [[phalanx formation]]. The sight of an advancing armored formation of ''triarii'' legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating ''hastati'' and ''principes'' troops. ''Ad triarios redisse'' \u2013 ''To fall back upon the triarii'' was a Roman [[idiom]] \u2013 meaning to use one's last resort.\n\nEach of these three lines was subdivided into (usually 10) chief tactical units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]. A maniple consisted of two [[Centuria|centuries]] and was commanded by the senior of the two [[centurion]]s. At this time, each century of hastati and principes consisted of 60 men; a century of triarii was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican (\"manipular\") legion a nominal strength of about 4,500 men.\n\n=== Late Republic (107\u201330 BC) ===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\n[[File:Legion Task ORG.png|thumb|500px|Visual representation of the post Marian Reform Legion showing size and disposition for Infantry formations]]\n''See also [[List of Roman legions]] for details of notable late Republican legions''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\nThe Marian reforms (of Gaius Marius) enlarged the centuries to 80 men, and grouped them into six-century \"cohorts\" (rather than two-century maniples). Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (''contubernia'') of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and [[cooking pot]].\n\nFollowing the reforms of the general [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in the 2nd century BC, the legions took on the second, narrower meaning that is familiar in the popular imagination as close-order citizen heavy infantry.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd century BC, [[Gaius Marius]] reformed the previously ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled [[Julius Caesar]] to cross the [[Rubicon]] with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic and early Empire are often called ''Marian'' legions. Following the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the ''Principes'': armed with two heavy javelins called ''pila'' (singular ''[[pilum]]''), the short sword called ''gladius'', chain mail (''[[lorica hamata]]''), helmet and rectangular shield (''[[scutum (shield)|scutum]]'').\n\nThe role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called ''Auxilia''. ''Auxilia'' contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, [[light infantry]] or ''[[velites]]'', and labourers. There was also a [[reconnaissance]] [[squad]] of 10 or more light [[mounted infantry]] called ''[[speculatores]]'' who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of [[military intelligence]] service.\n\nAs part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]''. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries and in the case of the first cohort 5 double strength centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an ''[[optio]]''. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. Ranking within the legion was based on length of service, with the senior Centurion commanding the first century of the first cohort; he was called the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (First Spear), and reported directly to the superior officers (legates and tribuni). All career soldiers could be promoted to the higher ranks in recognition of exceptional acts of bravery or valour. A newly promoted junior Centurion would be assigned to the sixth century of the tenth cohort and slowly progressed through the ranks from there.\n\nEvery legion had a large baggage train, which included 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25\u201330&nbsp;kg (50\u201360 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed ''Marius' Mules'' because of the amount of gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from the main body of the legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.\n\nA typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 11,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries. During the Later Roman Empire, the legion was reduced in size to 1,000 to allow for easier provisioning and to expand the regions under surveillance. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; [[Julius Caesar]]'s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.\n\nTactics were not very different from the past, but their effectiveness was largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.\n\n[[Image:Centurio 70 aC - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor as a Roman centurion, ''c.'' 70.]]\n[[Image:Roman legionaire in lorica segmentata.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, showing a Roman [[Legionary|''miles'']], (2nd century).]]\n\nAfter the Marian reforms and throughout the history of Rome's Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC, the threat of the legions under a [[demagogue]] was recognized. [[Roman Governor|Governors]] were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When [[Julius Caesar]] broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the [[Rubicon]] into Italy, he precipitated a [[constitutional crisis]]. This crisis and the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] under [[Augustus]] in 27 BC.\n\n[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|left|100px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117\u201338), showing the '''legions''' deployed in 125]]\n\n=== Early Empire (27 BC\u2013AD 284) ===\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\n''See  [[List of Roman legions#Early Empire legions|List of Roman legions of the early Empire]]''<br />\n''See also [[List of Roman army unit types#Sub-Units of the Roman legion|Sub-Units of the Roman legion]]''\n\n[[File:Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 14 AD.Source: http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-14-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg]]\n\nGenerals, during the recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. During this time, there was a high incidence of ''Gemina'' (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a [[legatus]] and six duces). At the end of the civil war against [[Mark Antony]], Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]], in which 3 legions were completely destroyed by the [[Germanics]]).\n\nBeside streamlining the army, Augustus also regulated the soldiers' pay. At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the [[Praetorian Guard]] along with a permanent [[Roman Navy|navy]] where served the ''liberti'', or freed slaves.\nThe legions also became permanent at this time, and not recruited for particular campaigns. They were also allocated to static bases with permanent ''[[castra]] legionaria'' (legionary fortresses).\n\nAugustus' military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions (hence the wry remark of the philosopher [[Favorinus]] that ''It is ill arguing with the master of 30 legions''). With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops (according to Tacitus), the total force available to a legion commander during the [[Pax Romana]] probably ranged from 11,000 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. By the time of the emperor [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], 193-211, the auxiliaries may have composed 55 to 60% of the army, 250,000 of 447,000. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000\u201316,000 or about the size of a modern [[Division (military)|division]].\n\nThroughout the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] or take it away. For example, the defeat of [[Vitellius]] in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] was decided when the [[Danube|Danubian]] legions chose to support [[Vespasian]].\n\nIn the empire, the legion was standardized, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a ''[[legatus]]'' or ''legate''. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three-year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected ''military tribunes'' \u2013 five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the ''praefectus castrorum'' (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.\n\n=== Later Empire (from 284 AD) ===\n{{Main|Late Roman army}}\n{{See also|List of Roman legions}}\n[[File:Roman soldier end of third century northern province - cropped.jpg|thumb|100px|A re-enactor, portraying a legionary at the end of the 3rd century]]\n[[File:Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg|thumb|Map of Roman legions by 212 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1447/files/2014/05/Roman-legions-212-AD-Centrici-site-Keilo-Jack.jpg |title=Map |website=.hypotheses.org}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the [[Late Antiquity|Later Roman Empire]], the number of legions was increased and the [[Military establishment of the Roman empire|Roman Army]] expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the [[Tetrarchy]], although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite ''legiones palatinae'' created by [[Diocletian]] and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old Legions. The earliest ''legiones palatinae'' were the ''Lanciarii'', ''Joviani'', ''[[Herculians|Herculiani]]'' and ''Divitenses''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]]. In addition to the elite ''[[palatini (Roman military)|palatini]]'', other legions called ''[[comitatenses]]'' and ''[[pseudocomitatenses]]'', along with the ''[[auxilia palatina]]'', provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The [[Notitia Dignitatum]] lists 25 ''legiones palatinae'', 70 ''legiones comitatenses'', 47 ''legiones pseudocomitatenses'' and 111 ''auxilia palatina'' in the field armies, and a further 47 ''legiones'' in the frontier armies.<ref>Totals from summary of Notitia Dignitatum in Richardot, Philippe, ''La fin de l'arm\u00e9e romaine 284\u2013476'' [3rd ed.] Economica, 2005. {{ISBN|2-7178-4861-4}}.</ref> Legion names such as ''[[Honorius (emperor)|Honoriani]]'' and ''[[Gratian]]enses'' found in the Notitia suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from ''[[vexillatio]]nes'' or from old legions. In addition, there were 24 vexillationes palatini, 73 vexillationes comitatenses; 305 other units in the Eastern limitanei and 181 in the Western limitanei.<ref>Jones, Later Roman Empire, pp. 1449\u201350</ref>\n\nAccording to the late Roman writer [[Vegetius]]' ''[[De Re Militari]]'', each century had a [[ballista]] and each cohort had an [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]], giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers, each manned by 10 ''libritors'' (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps ([[castra]]) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as [[field artillery]] during battles or in support of river crossings.\n\nDespite a number of reforms, the Legion system survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and was continued in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until around 7th century, when reforms begun by Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the increasing need for soldiers around the Empire resulted in the [[Theme system]]. Despite this, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions, and were maintained with similar level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization.\n\n==Legionary ranks==\nAside from the rank and file [[legionary]] (who received the base wage of 10 [[as (coin)|ass\u0113s]] a day or 225 [[denarius|denarii]] a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the Marian reforms (104 BC) until the military reforms of [[Diocletian#Economic and military reforms|Diocletian]] (c. 290).\n\n===Senior officers===\n* '''''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''''', '''Imperial Legate''': The commander of two or more legions. The Imperial Legate also served as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of [[Roman Senate|Senatorial rank]], the Imperial Legate was appointed by the Emperor and usually held command for 3 or 4 years. In the present time, an Imperial Legate would be called a General.\n* '''''[[Legatus legionis]]''''', '''Legion Legate''': The overall legion commander. The post was usually filled by a [[Roman Senate|senator]], appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a [[Roman province]] with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial [[Roman governor|governor]]. In such circumstances, the Legatus was dual-hatted as both Legion Legate and Imperial Legate. The Legion Legate also served as commander of the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] attached to the legion though they were not formally a part of the legion's command structure.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribunus laticlavius]]''''', '''Broad Band Tribune''': Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience he was not the actual second in command in battle, but if the legate died he would take command of the legion.\n* '''''[[Praefectus castrorum]]''''', '''Camp Prefect''': The Camp Prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the ''tribunii'' whom he outranked, and who previously had served as ''primus pilus'' and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of [[auxilia]]ires.\n* '''''[[Military tribune|Tribuni angusticlavii]]''''', '''Narrow Band Tribunes''': Each legion had five lower ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers.<ref>Bowman, Garnsey, Rathbone (eds) ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 11'' pp. 326\u201327</ref> This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man's political career (see [[cursus honorum]]).<ref>Birley, Anthony R. ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor.'' (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1989) p. 40</ref>\n\n===Centurions===\nThe rank of [[centurion]] was an officer grade that included many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the ''[[primus pilus]]'' (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort's first century was known as a ''pilus prior'' and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as ''primi ordines''.\n\n[[File:Centurion 2 Boulogne Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|160px|A historical reenactor in Roman centurion costume]]\n\nThe six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:\n* The forward hastati (forward spears)\n* The rear hastati (rear spears)\n* The forward principes (forward principal line)\n* The rear principes (rear principal line)\n* The forward triarii (forward third line)\n* The rear triarii (rear third line)\n\nThe centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.\n* '''''[[Primus pilus]]''''', literally '''First File''': The ''Primus Pilus'' was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a \"front spear\" and a \"back spear\" century.) The primus pilus had a chance of later becoming a ''Praefectus Castrorum''. When the primus pilus retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. Primus Pilus were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.\n* ''Pilus prior'': The \"front file\" centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of their entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.\n* ''Primi ordines'': The \"ranks of the first [cohort]\" were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.\n* ''Other centurions'': Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage''.\n\n===Lower ranks===\n* ''[[Optio]]'': One for each centurion (59\u201360), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were paid twice the basic wage. Equivalent to a modern [[First Sergeant]].<ref name=\"CCW20\">Caesar's Civil War, Adrian Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKTABZiThz4C&pg=PA20 p. 20]</ref>\n* ''[[Tesserarius]]'': (Guard commander) One for each century. They acted as seconds to the Optios and were paid one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard. Equivalent to a modern [[Staff Sergeant]].\n* ''[[Decurion (military)|Decurion]]'': Commanded a cavalry unit (''[[turma]]'') of 10 to 30 ''eques legionis''.<ref name=\"CCW20\"/>\n* ''[[Decanus]]'': Commanded a ''[[contubernium]]'' or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants,  equivalent to a [[Sergeant]] or [[Corporal]].  A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a [[Quaternion (disambiguation)|Quaternion]].\n\n===Special duty posts===\n* ''[[Aquilifer]]'': A single position within the legion. The aquilifer was the legion's [[Heraldic standard|standard]]\u2013 or [[Aquila (Roman)|''Aquila'']] (eagle)\u2013 bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the aquila was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Signifer]]'': Each century had a ''signifer'' (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] the 1st century's ''signifer'' would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the ''centurial signum'', a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the ''signum'', the ''signifer'' also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Cornicen]]'' (Horn blower): Worked hand in hand with the signifer drawing the attention of the men to the centurial signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Imaginifer]]'': A special position from the time of [[Augustus]] onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops' loyalty to him. He was paid twice the basic wage.\n* ''[[Immunes]]'': Immunes were legionary soldiers who possessed specialized skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. [[Engineer]]s, [[artillerymen]], [[musician]]s, clerks, [[quartermaster]]s, drill and weapons instructors, [[carpenter]]s, [[hunter]]s, medical staff and [[military police]] were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.\n* ''[[Evocatus]]'': A veteran of the Roman army who had earned his [[Roman military diploma|military diploma]] for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.\n* ''[[Duplicarius]]'': A special pay grade that could also be awarded regardless of rank, received double the basic pay.\n\n==Pay==\nFrom the time of [[Gaius Marius]] onwards, legionaries received 225 ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' a year (equal to 900 [[Sestertius|''Sestertii'']]); this basic rate remained unchanged until [[Domitian]], who increased it to 300 denarii. <!-- need info on how long this timespan was? --> In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of [[Septimius Severus]], who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the [[P.O.W.|prisoners of war]] and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.\n\nAll legionary soldiers would also receive a ''praemia'' ([[veterans' benefits]]) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 ''denarii'' from the time of [[Augustus]]) and/or a plot of good [[Farming in ancient Rome|farmland]] (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under [[Caracalla]], the ''praemia'' increased to 5,000 ''denarii''.\n\n==Symbols==\nFrom 104 BC onwards, each legion used an [[aquila (Roman)|aquila]] (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as [[aquilifer]], and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.<ref name=\"Authors2015\">{{cite book|author=Several Authors|title=History of The Roman Legions: History of Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLQ2CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1069|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Self-Publish|pages=1069\u2013|id=GGKEY:DXPWT430TXP}}</ref>\n[[File:Roman soldiers with aquilifer signifer centurio 70 aC.jpg|thumb|Reenacters portraying Roman legionaries of [[Legio XV Apollinaris]].]]\nIn ''Gallic War'' (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55 BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the [[Legio X Gemina|tenth legion]] threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.\n\nWith the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called [[imaginifer]], whose role was to carry a pike with the ''imago'' (image, sculpture) of the emperor as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nEach legion, furthermore, had a ''[[vexillifer]]'' who carried a ''vexillum'' or ''signum'', with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, ''[[vexillatio]]nes''. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.\n\nCivilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an arrow without a head. This was considered a great honour and would bring the recipient much prestige.\n\n==Discipline==\n{{Main|Roman military decorations and punishments}}\n\nThe military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess [[Disciplina]], whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.\n\n===Minor punishments===\n* '''Castigatio''' \u2013 being hit by the centurion with his staff or ''animadversio fustium'' (Tac. Annals I, 23)\n* \u2013 ''Reduction of rations'' or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration\n* '''Pecuniaria mulcta''' \u2013 Reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance\n*\u2013 ''Flogging'' in front of the century, cohort or legion\n* \u2013 ''Whipping'' with the ''[[flagrum]]'' (''flagellum'', ''flagella''), or \"short whip\" \u2013 a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The \"short whip\" was used by slave volunteers, ''volones'', who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.\n* '''[[Gradus deiectio]]''' \u2013 Reduction in rank\n* '''[[Missio ignominiosa]]''' \u2013 Dishonourable discharge\n* \u2013 Loss of ''time in service'' advantages\n* '''[[Militiae mutatio]]''' \u2013 Relegation to inferior service or duties.\n* '''[[Munerum indictio]]''' \u2013 Additional duties\n\n===Major punishments===\n* ''[[Fustuarium]]'' \u2013 a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by [[cudgel]]s, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of ''fustuarium'' who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the [[Tribune]] would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The Tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the [[Fustuarium]]. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html|title=The Histories of Polybius: Fragments of Book VI p.357|last=Edwards|first=H.

One out of every ten men, chosen by lots, would be beaten to death, usually by the other nine with their bare hands, who would be forced to live outside the camp and in some instances obliged to renew the military oath, the ''[[Sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Factors in the legion's success ==\n[[File:Villa-borg-2011-legionaere.ogv|thumbtime=22|thumb|Reenactment: Training]]\n[[Montesquieu]] wrote that \"the main reason for the Romans becoming masters of the world was that, having fought successively against all peoples, they always gave up their own practices as soon as they found better ones.\"<ref>Montesquieu C., ''Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and Their Decline'', Hacket, 1999, p. 24</ref>\n\nExamples of ideas that were copied and adapted include weapons like the [[gladius]] (Iberians) and warship design (cf. Carthaginians' [[quinquereme]]), as well as military units, such as [[cataphract|heavy mounted cavalry]] and [[horse archer|mounted archers]] ([[Parthia]]ns and [[Numidians]]).\n* Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents. Over time, the legions effectively handled challenges ranging from cavalry, to guerrillas, and to siege warfare.\n* Roman discipline (cf. [[decimation (Roman army)]]), organization and systematization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, field fortification etc.\n* The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents. Wars with Carthage and the Parthians and most notably, the campaigns against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], illustrate this.\n* Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.\n* The influence of Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n* Strict, and more importantly, uniform discipline made commanding, maintaining, and replacing Roman legionaries a much more consistent exercise.\n* Roman military equipment (cf. [[Roman military personal equipment]]), particularly armor, was more withstanding and far more ubiquitous, especially in the late Republican and Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.\n* Roman engineering skills were second to none in ancient Europe, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications (cf. [[Sudis (stake)|sudis]], [[castra]]), was another major advantage for the Roman legions.\n* Roman military training focused on the more effective thrusting of the sword rather than the slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)]]\n* [[Early Roman army]]\n* [[Imperial Roman army]]\n* [[Late Roman army]]\n* [[Legionary]]\n* [[List of Roman wars]]\n* [[List of Roman battles]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[List of Roman legions]]\n* [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Marian Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army]]\n* [[Roman army of the mid-Republic]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structural history of the Roman military]]\n* For a more detailed analysis, as well as the Romans in battle, see the articles [[Roman infantry tactics]] and [[Roman military personal equipment]].\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah19101/full ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient History'', Legions, history and location of]\n* ''History of the Art of War.
