Since [[pasteurization]] was not yet available, many children faced sickness from consuming [[raw milk]]. Wood arranged for doctors to certify his milk was sanitary and safe for consumption, which convinced many consumers to buy the product.<ref name=\"Wawaplace3\"/> The strategy worked, and allowed the Wawa dairy to grow. Demand for dairy products grew rapidly during the 1920s, and so did the company. Wawa began using the slogan \"Buy Health by the Bottle\"; they served customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, delivering milk to customers' homes.\n\nIn the 1960s, however, many consumers began buying milk in stores instead of using home delivery. Wawa started to open its own stores to adjust to these market changes.<ref name=\"AboutWawa\"/><ref name=\"Wawaplace3\"/> On April 16, 1964, Grahame Wood, George Wood's grandson, opened the first Wawa Food Market at 1212 MacDade Boulevard in [[Folsom, Pennsylvania]],<ref name=\"WawaTimeline\"/> which remained in operation until June 17, 2016, when it closed in favor of a new \"Super Wawa\" down the street.

Open both earlier and later than traditional [[supermarket]]s, they carried other foods and beverages besides milk, as well as other items from the Wawa dairy.\n[[File:Wawa Dairy Farms.JPG|thumb|The old Wawa Dairy Farms building in [[Wawa, Pennsylvania]]]]\n\nIn 1977, Wawa began sharing ownership of the company with its associates through [[profit-sharing]] plans. In 1992, Wawa formalized its associate ownership with its [[Employee Stock Ownership Plan]] (ESOP), with stock being awarded to associates annually based on the prior year's service. Because the company is privately held, Wawa secures an independent assessment of its stock value at regular intervals to ensure that the ESOP is fairly maintained.  Today, the ESOP accounts for more than 40% of Wawa stock.\n\n==Company==\n\n===Name and logo===\nThe [[store chain|chain]]'s name comes from the site of the company's first milk plant and corporate headquarters in the [[Wawa, Pennsylvania]] area.

Wawa began using the slogan \"Buy Health by the Bottle\"; they served customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, delivering milk to customers' homes.\n\nIn the 1960s, however, many consumers began buying milk in stores instead of using home delivery.

He was defeated the following year, but elected [[alderman]] in 1850, 1853 and 1854, when he was elected mayor. He also served on the executive of the [[Bytown Mechanics' Institute]].\n\nThe municipality of Bytown became the new city of Ottawa in 1855. Friel was elected alderman there from 1855 to 1858 and in 1864, 1865 and 1867. In 1863, he was a member of the first Board of Police Commissioners for Ottawa. The board, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary expense, originally concluded that there was no need for a salaried police force in the city. However, in May that same year, the militia had to be called in to control a riot in the city. In 1865, a bylaw was introduced establishing an official police force. In 1868, while mayor, Friel posted a proclamation announcing a $2,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the assassin of [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]].\n\n== Professional life ==\nIn 1846, he purchased the ''[[Bytown Packet]]'', a local newspaper, with John George Bell. He sold this paper in October 1849 to Robert Bell, who renamed it the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' in 1849. In 1858, he established a new paper, the ''Ottawa Union'', also referred to as the ''Daily Union''. He later sold it to a rival paper, the ''Ottawa Times'' in 1866.\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe died in Ottawa in 1869 of [[pneumonia]] while still in office.

His family moved to Bytown, which was later renamed Ottawa, in 1827.\n\n== Political Life ==\nFriel was [[1847 Bytown municipal election|elected to Bytown's first town council in 1847]]. He was defeated the following year, but elected [[alderman]] in 1850, 1853 and 1854, when he was elected mayor. He also served on the executive of the [[Bytown Mechanics' Institute]].\n\nThe municipality of Bytown became the new city of Ottawa in 1855. Friel was elected alderman there from 1855 to 1858 and in 1864, 1865 and 1867. In 1863, he was a member of the first Board of Police Commissioners for Ottawa. The board, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary expense, originally concluded that there was no need for a salaried police force in the city. However, in May that same year, the militia had to be called in to control a riot in the city. In 1865, a bylaw was introduced establishing an official police force. In 1868, while mayor, Friel posted a proclamation announcing a $2,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the assassin of [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]].\n\n== Professional Life ==\nIn 1846, he purchased the [[Bytown Packet]], a local newspaper, with John George Bell. He sold this paper in October 1849 to Robert Bell, who renamed it the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' in 1849. In 1858, he established a new paper, the ''Ottawa Union'', also referred to as the ''Daily Union''. He later sold it to a rival paper, the ''Ottawa Times'' in 1866.\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe died in Ottawa in 1869 of [[pneumonia]] while still in office.

Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction.

This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route turns northeast, passing through a predominantly rural and agricultural area, and about {{convert|19|mi|km}} later comes to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|State Route 109]] (SR 109).

legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction.

When quark\u2013gluon plasma disassembles into [[hadron]]s in a breakup process, the high availability of strange [[quark|antiquarks]] helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds.\n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581|doi=10.1038/35001196|pmid=10688162|bibcode=2000Natur.403..581A|issn=0028-0836|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|bibcode=2010PhT....63e..39J|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks.

The [[ALICE experiment]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy.

Instead, this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|Mueller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size.

Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions remains an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around.

In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==ALICE: Resolution of remaining questions about strangeness as signature  of quark-gluon plasma==\n[[File:Alice1807StrangeY.png|thumb|280px|Universal dependence of <math>p(uud)+\\bar{p}(\\bar{u}\\bar{u}\\bar{d}),</math><math> K_s(d\\bar{s}+\\bar{d}s),</math><math> \\Lambda(uds)+\\bar{\\Lambda}(\\bar{u}\\bar{d}\\bar{s}), \\phi(s\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Xi^-(dss)+\\bar{\\Xi}^+(\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Omega(sss)+\\bar{\\Omega}(\\bar{s}\\bar{s}\\bar{s})</math> multiplicities (scaled by yield of <math>\\pi^++\\pi^-</math>) obtained in p-p, p-A and A-A by LHC-ALICE experiment at LHC collision energies indicated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Albuquerque|first=D.S.D.|year=2019|title=Hadronic resonances, strange and multi-strange particle production in Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947418301775|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=982|pages=823\u2013826|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.08.033|via=}}</ref>]]\n[[File:AliceEventMultiplicityPrelim159143.png|thumb|280px|Ratio to pion of integrated yields for <math>p, K^0_s, \\Lambda, \\phi, \\Xi</math> and <math>\\Omega</math>.

Among the most discussed challenges has been the question if the abundance of particles produced is enhanced or if the comparison base line is suppressed. Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is produced rarely. This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Rolf|date=|year=1968|title=Statistical thermodynamics of strong interactions at high energies - III : heavy pair(quark) production rates|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/936485|journal=Nuovo Cimento Suppl.|volume=6|pages=311-354|via=}}</ref> and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears.

This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) compared to <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>). [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) there since the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) which requires two pairs minimum to be made.  However, we also see an increase at very high volume - this is an effect at the level of one-two standard deviations. Similar results were already recognized before by Petran et al..<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petr\u00e1\u0148|first=Michal|last2=Rafelski|first2=Johann|year=2010|title=Multistrange particle production and the statistical hadronization model|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=82|issue=1|pages=011901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother highly praised [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] result<ref name=\":0\" /> is the observation of same strangeness enhancement not only on AA  (nucleus-nucleus) but also in pA (proton-nucleus) and pp (proton-proton) collisions when the particle production yields are presented as a function of the multiplicity, which as noted corresponds to the available [[hadronization]] volume. ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume, there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|Mueller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions is today an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=I. Kuznetsova|author2=J.

These results are presented as function of the variable called [[rapidity]] which characterizes the speed of the source. The peak of emission indicates that the additionally formed antimatter particles do not originate from the colliding nuclei themselves, but from a source that moves at a speed corresponding to one-half of the rapidity of the incident nucleus that is a common center of momentum frame of reference source formed when both nuclei collide, that is the hot quark\u2013gluon plasma fireball.\n==Horn in <math>K \\rightarrow \\pi </math> ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb|280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions.]]One of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gazdzicki|first=Marek|last2=Gorenstein|first2=Mark|last3=Seyboth|first3=Peter|year=2020|title=Brief history of the search for critical structures in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02255|journal=arXiv:2004.02255 [hep-ph, physics:nucl-ex, physics:nucl-th]|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> It is natural to expect that if such a threshold exists the particle yields/ratios we have shown above should indicate that.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becattini|first=F.|year=2012|title=Strangeness and onset of deconfinement|journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei|language=en|volume=75|issue=5|pages=646\u2013649|doi=10.1134/S106377881205002X|bibcode=2012PAN....75..646B|issn=1063-7788}}</ref> One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative [[Kaon]] yield ratio.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=N.K.

The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content.

Jomsom has the only hospital.<ref name=GHT/>\n\nBecause of low access to facilities and other socio-cultural factors, for most people in Mustang, traditional herbal medicines are the popular mode of medical care and ''Amchis'' (traditional Tibetan healers) are the local medical experts.<ref name=BMed/> Local ''Amchis'' use 72 species of medicinal plants to treat 43 human ailments.<ref name=RMW/> They use different forms of medication including pastes (60 species), powders (48), decoctions (35), tablets (7), pills (5), cold infusions (5), and others means, administered through oral, nasal, topical and other routes. Most people here have deep faith in the ''Amchis''.<ref name=BMed/>\n\n''Amchis''  have a unique method of maintaining quality of the medicine. They collect medicinal plants always on their own, because only they have experience extensive enough to identify the right plants. Also, only an ''Amchi'' knows when to collect the plants, as the timing, while very important in capturing active principles of the plants, varies by days, even months.<ref name=BMed/>\n\nThen they store their herbs in bags made from the skin of [[Moschus chrysogaster]] (Himalayan musk deer), tied twice with a thread. Tying a herb in musk deer skin helps it, according to ''Amchis'', to remain effective for a couple of years. Horn and urine of musk deer and tortoise bones, as well as parts of other animal are also used along with plant parts.<ref name=BMed/>\n\nThey use a stone slab to grind their medicine, because they believe the heat created by an electric grinder would degrade the active principles of the plant powder, reducing its quality. Powdered ingredients are then mixed with water. Sufficient amount of additives are also added. Plant parts are commonly prepared using water, hot or cold, as the solvent (100 species), but occasionally remedies are prepared with milk (14 species), honey (2), [[jaggery]] or Indian [[cane sugar]] (2), [[ghee]] or Indian [[clarified butter]] (2) and oil (1) in preparing pills in round or rectangular shapes.

Jomsom has the only hospital.<ref name=GHT/>\n\nBecause of low access to facilities and other socio-cultural factors, for most people in Mustang, traditional herbal medicines are the popular mode of medical care and ''Amchis'' (traditional Tibetan healers) are the local medical experts.<ref name=BMed/> Local ''Amchis'' use 72 species of medicinal plants to treat 43 human ailments.<ref name=RMW/> They use different forms of medication including pastes (60 species), powders (48), decoctions (35), tablets (7), pills (5), cold infusions (5), and others means, administered through oral, nasal, topical and other routes. Most people here have deep faith in the ''Amchis''.<ref name=BMed/>\n\n''Amchis''  have a unique method of maintaining quality of the medicine. They collect medicinal plants always on their own, because only they have experience extensive enough to identify the right plants. Also, only an ''Amchi'' knows when to collect the plants, as the timing, while very important in capturing active principles of the plants, varies by days, even months.<ref name=BMed/>\n\nThen they store their herbs in bags made from the skin of [[Moschus chrysogaster]] (Himalayan musk deer), tied twice with a thread. Tying a herb in musk deer skin helps it, according to ''Amchis'', to remain effective for a couple of years. Horn and urine of musk deer and tortoise bones, as well as parts of other animal are also used along with plant parts.<ref name=BMed/>\n\nThey use a stone slab to grind their medicine, because they believe the heat created by an electric grinder would degrade the active principles of the plant powder, reducing its quality. Powdered ingredients are then mixed with water. Sufficient amount of additives are also added. Plant parts are commonly prepared using water, hot or cold, as the solvent (100 species), but occasionally remedies are prepared with milk (14 species), honey (2), [[jaggery]] or Indian [[cane sugar]] (2), [[ghee]] or Indian [[clarified butter]] (2) and oil (1) in preparing pills in round or rectangular shapes.

Baldy]] viewed from Beaver, photographed by [[William Bell (photographer)|William Bell]] during the 1872 [[Wheeler Survey]]]]\n\nIndigenous peoples lived in this area for thousands of years, as shown by archeological evidence. A number of identified prehistoric sites have been found in Beaver County, dating to the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic]] and Sevier [[Fremont culture|Fremont]] periods. A prehistoric [[obsidian]] quarry site has been identified in the nearby [[Mineral Mountains (Utah)|Mineral Mountains]].\n\nThe historic [[Southern Paiute]] inhabited the region well before encounter with the first European explorers. The 1776 [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition]] is the first known European exploration in this area. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1847\u20131848, Mormons from the United States developed a trade route through the Beaver River valley between their new settlements at [[Salt Lake City]] in the Utah Territory and [[Los Angeles]], which was still part of [[Alta California]], [[Mexico]]. The original route crossed the river 3 miles downstream from Beaver at the site that later was developed as [[Greenville, Utah|Greenville]]. This route became known during the [[California Gold Rush]] as the Southern Route of the [[California Trail]]. Later called the [[Mormon Road]] or California Road, it passed over the [[Black Mountains (Utah)|Black Mountains]] between the crossing and [[Muley Point (Iron County, Utah)|Muley Point]]. Following United States victory in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848), it took over California and the Southwest.\n\nIn 1855, as part of improvements, the Mormon Road over the Black Mountains was realigned eastward. It was routed from the site that developed as Beaver to [[Muley Point (Iron County, Utah)|Muley Point]] through more wagon-friendly terrain in [[Nevershine Hollow]] and over [[Beaver Ridge (Beaver County, Utah)|Beaver Ridge]] into the canyon of [[Fremont Wash]], rejoining the original road above Muley Point.  This road became a winter commercial wagon road, known in California as the Los Angeles \u2013 Salt Lake Road, and in Mormon settlements in [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[Arizona Territory]] (now southern Nevada) as the California Road.\n\nBeaver was settled in 1856 by [[Mormon pioneers]] traveling this road; it was one of a string of Mormon settlements along the road through Utah. By design, these settlements were located a day's ride on horseback apart, which explains the regularity of their spacing. They were generally {{convert|30|mi}} apart. Where intervening settlements failed or were absorbed, they became {{convert|60|mi}} apart. Beaver was developed between the settlements in the [[Pahvant Valley]] and those in the [[Parowan Valley]].\n\nIn 1873 the US Army established [[Fort Cameron]] two miles from Beaver because of Indian raids on the area Mormon settlements. To serve this isolated area, the territorial government placed the Second Judicial Court of the Utah Territory in Beaver from 1870 until 1896, when Utah became a state. Also included in this court's jurisdiction were Iron, [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]], [[Kane County, Utah|Kane]], [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield]], and [[Piute County, Utah|Piute]] counties. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1856 Mormons migrated to the [[Beaver Valley (Utah)|Beaver Valley]] from [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] to the south. George A. Smith called a council meeting in February 1856, and the men elected Simeon F. Howd as presiding elder and Edward W. Thompson, clerk. In 1858, numerous migrants from [[San Bernardino, California]], settled here.<ref>''Sketches from Life and Labors of Wilson Gates Nowers'' by Reinhard Maeser, PD.B.B.D Beaver City, Utah, 1914.</ref>  In December 1859, W.

A [[hydroelectric]] generation plant was constructed on the [[Beaver River (Utah)|Beaver River]] early in the 20th century.

The [[Beaver River (Utah)|Beaver River]] flows out of the mountains and through the city of Beaver, passing south of downtown before continuing west towards [[Minersville, Utah|Minersville]] and the [[Escalante Desert]] basin. The [[Mineral Mountains (Utah)|Mineral Mountains]] rise to the west of Beaver, and the South Hills are to the south.\n\nInterstate 15 runs along the western edge of Beaver, with access from exits 109 and 112. I-15 leads north {{convert|22|mi|abbr=on}} to the western end of [[Interstate 70]] at [[Cove Fort]], {{convert|55|mi|abbr=on}} north to [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]], and {{convert|53|mi|abbr=on}} south to [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]].

The hottest recorded temperature in Beaver is {{convert|102|F|C|1|disp=or}}, which has occurred twice on June 21, 1913 and July 26, 1931, and 23.3 days will on average top {{convert|90|F|C|1|disp=or}}, although the hottest monthly mean minimum is only {{convert|62.0|F|C|disp=or}} in July 1968.\n\nWinters are cold, though not severe, and generally dry, with the city's intermountain valley location making it sufficiently dry that only {{convert|34.1|in|m|2|disp=or}} of snowfall can be expected each winter. Typically temperatures fall below freezing on all but six nights during winter and on 193.7 nights during an entire year; however maxima will top freezing on all but 14.3 afternoons. Temperatures below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} occur on 9.8 nights per winter, and the coldest temperature on record is {{convert|&minus;34|F|C|1|disp=or}} on February 9, 1933 during an exceptionally cold western winter. The most snowfall has been at least {{convert|80.50|in|m}} between July 1948 and June 1949, and the most in a month {{convert|33.5|in|m|2}} during the notoriously cold January 1949 which averaged a record low {{convert|9.9|F|C|disp=or}} with mean minimum as low as {{convert|&minus;2.1|F|C|disp=or}}; by way of contrast, no measurable snow fell during the mild, dry winter of 1962\u201363.

Baldy]] viewed from Beaver, photographed by [[William Bell (photographer)|William Bell]] during the 1872 [[Wheeler Survey]]]]\n\nIndigenous peoples lived in this area for thousands of years, as shown by archeological evidence. A number of identified prehistoric sites have been found in Beaver County, dating to the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic]] and Sevier [[Fremont culture|Fremont]] periods. A prehistoric [[obsidian]] quarry site has been identified in the nearby [[Mineral Mountains (Utah)|Mineral Mountains]].\n\nThe historic [[Southern Paiute]] inhabited the region well before encounter with the first European explorers. The 1776 [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition]] is the first known European exploration in this area. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1847\u20131848, Mormons from the United States developed a trade route through the Beaver River valley between their new settlements at [[Salt Lake City]] in the Utah Territory and [[Los Angeles]], which was still part of [[Alta California]], [[Mexico]]. The original route crossed the river 3 miles downstream from Beaver at the site that later was developed as [[Greenville, Utah|Greenville]]. This route became known during the [[California Gold Rush]] as the Southern Route of the [[California Trail]]. Later called the [[Mormon Road]] or California Road, it passed over the [[Black Mountains (Utah)|Black Mountains]] between the crossing and [[Muley Point (Iron County, Utah)|Muley Point]]. Following United States victory in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848), it took over California and the Southwest.\n\nIn 1855, as part of improvements, the Mormon Road over the Black Mountains was realigned eastward. It was routed from the site that developed as Beaver to [[Muley Point (Iron County, Utah)|Muley Point]] through more wagon-friendly terrain in [[Nevershine Hollow]] and over [[Beaver Ridge (Beaver County, Utah)|Beaver Ridge]] into the canyon of [[Fremont Wash]], rejoining the original road above Muley Point.  This road became a winter commercial wagon road, known in California as the Los Angeles \u2013 Salt Lake Road, and in Mormon settlements in [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[Arizona Territory]] (now southern Nevada) as the California Road.\n\nBeaver was settled in 1856 by [[Mormon pioneers]] traveling this road; it was one of a string of Mormon settlements along the road through Utah. By design, these settlements were located a day's ride on horseback apart, which explains the regularity of their spacing. They were generally {{convert|30|mi}} apart. Where intervening settlements failed or were absorbed, they became {{convert|60|mi}} apart. Beaver was developed between the settlements in the [[Pahvant Valley]] and those in the [[Parowan Valley]].\n\nIn 1873 the US Army established [[Fort Cameron]] two miles from Beaver because of Indian raids on the area Mormon settlements. To serve this isolated area, the territorial government placed the Second Judicial Court of the Utah Territory in Beaver from 1870 until 1896, when Utah became a state. Also included in this court's jurisdiction were Iron, [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]], [[Kane County, Utah|Kane]], [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield]], and [[Piute County, Utah|Piute]] counties. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1856 Mormons migrated to the [[Beaver Valley (Utah)|Beaver Valley]] from [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] to the south. George A. Smith called a council meeting in February 1856, and the men elected Simeon F. Howd as presiding elder and Edward W. Thompson, clerk. In 1858, numerous migrants from [[San Bernardino, California]], settled here.<ref>''Sketches from Life and Labors of Wilson Gates Nowers'' by Reinhard Maeser, PD.B.B.D Beaver City, Utah, 1914.</ref>  In December 1859, W.

(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 53</ref>\n\nDuring the 1870s, settlers made an effort to establish a woolen mill, a tannery, and a dairy industry. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Most were engaged in stock raising.\n\nBeaver was the first town in Utah to be [[electrified]]. A [[hydroelectric]] generation plant was constructed on the [[Beaver River (Utah)|Beaver River]] early in the 20th century. The plant continues to provide a large part of Beaver's power requirements today.\n\nIn 2006, Beaver won a contest for best tasting rural water in the United States.<ref name=water>{{cite news |author=[[Lee Benson]] |title=Beaver's water is worth a stop |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=November 18, 2009 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705345308/Beavers-water-is-worth-a-stop.html |accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2010, Beaver took top honors in the world for best tasting water.<ref name=bestwater>{{cite news|title=Utah water dubbed 'world's best'|newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=April 21, 2010 |url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_14927314}}</ref> Its welcome billboards along I-15 highlight the water quality.\n\n==Notable natives and residents==\n<!-- Put and keep in alphabetical order by surname -->\n* [[Butch Cassidy]], born here, became a notorious outlaw in the American West\n* [[Philo T.

To the east of Beaver lie the [[Tushar Mountains]]. The peaks in these mountains rise to over {{convert|12000|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Beaver River (Utah)|Beaver River]] flows out of the mountains and through the city of Beaver, passing south of downtown before continuing west towards [[Minersville, Utah|Minersville]] and the [[Escalante Desert]] basin. The [[Mineral Mountains (Utah)|Mineral Mountains]] rise to the west of Beaver, and the South Hills are to the south.\n\nInterstate 15 runs along the western edge of Beaver, with access from exits 109 and 112. I-15 leads north {{convert|22|mi|abbr=on}} to the western end of [[Interstate 70]] at [[Cove Fort]], {{convert|55|mi|abbr=on}} north to [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]], and {{convert|53|mi|abbr=on}} south to [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]].

Owing to the absence of cloudiness caused by the Great Salt Lake, nights are much cooler than in Salt Lake City or Ogden during this season. The hottest recorded temperature in Beaver is {{convert|102|F|C|1|disp=or}}, which has occurred twice on June 21, 1913 and July 26, 1931, and 23.3 days will on average top {{convert|90|F|C|1|disp=or}}, although the hottest monthly mean minimum is only {{convert|62.0|F|C|disp=or}} in July 1968.\n\nWinters are cold, though not severe, and generally dry, with the city's intermountain valley location making it sufficiently dry that only {{convert|34.1|in|m|2|disp=or}} of snowfall can be expected each winter. Typically temperatures fall below freezing on all but six nights during winter and on 193.7 nights during an entire year; however maxima will top freezing on all but 14.3 afternoons. Temperatures below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} occur on 9.8 nights per winter, and the coldest temperature on record is {{convert|&minus;34|F|C|1|disp=or}} on February 9, 1933 during an exceptionally cold western winter. The most snowfall has been at least {{convert|80.50|in|m}} between July 1948 and June 1949, and the most in a month {{convert|33.5|in|m|2}} during the notoriously cold January 1949 which averaged a record low {{convert|9.9|F|C|disp=or}} with mean minimum as low as {{convert|&minus;2.1|F|C|disp=or}}; by way of contrast, no measurable snow fell during the mild, dry winter of 1962\u201363.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.
