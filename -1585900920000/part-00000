It measures approximately {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, about half the diameter of [[Pluto]]. The object was discovered by American astronomers [[Chad Trujillo]] and [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] on 4 June 2002.<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> Signs of water ice on the surface of Quaoar have been found, which suggests that [[cryovolcanism]] may be occurring on Quaoar.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> A small amount of [[methane]] is present on its surface, which can only be retained by the largest Kuiper belt objects.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/> In February 2007, [[Weywot (moon)|Weywot]], a synchronous moon in orbit around Quaoar, was discovered by Brown.<ref name=\"IAUC8812\"/> Weywot is measured to be {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.<ref name=\"JOA2020-1\"/> Both objects were named after mythological figures from the Native American [[Tongva people]] in Southern California.

Brown|Michael Brown]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]] in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> The discovery formed part of the Caltech Wide Area Sky Survey, which was designed to search for the brightest [[Kuiper belt object]]s using the Palomar Observatory's 1.22-meter [[Samuel Oschin telescope]].<ref name=\"Trujillo2003\"/> Quaoar was first identified in images by Trujillo on 5 June 2002, when he noticed a dim, 18.6-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] object slowly moving among the stars of the [[constellation]] [[Ophiuchus]].<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> Quaoar appeared relatively bright for a distant object, suggesting that it could have a size comparable to the diameter of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]].<ref name=\"nasascience\"/>\n\nTo ascertain Quaoar's orbit, Brown and Trujillo initiated a search for archival [[precovery]] images. They obtained several precovery images taken by the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] survey from various observatories in 1996 and 2000\u20132002.<ref name=\"precovery\"/> In particular, they had also found two archival [[photographic plate]]s taken by astronomer [[Charles T. Kowal]] in May 1983,<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> who at the time was searching for the hypothesized [[Planet X]] at the Palomar Observatory.<ref name=\"caltech\"/><ref name=\"NYT-20021008\"/> From these precovery images, Brown and Trujillo were able to calculate Quaoar's orbit and distance. Additional precovery images of Quaoar have been later identified, with the earliest known found on a photographic plate imaged on 25 May 1954 from the [[Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]].<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/><ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n\nBefore announcing the discovery of Quaoar, Brown had planned to conduct follow-up observations using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] to measure Quaoar's size.<ref name=\"hubblesite\"/> He had also planned to announce the discovery as soon as possible and found it necessary to keep the discovery information confidential during the follow-up observations.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Rather than submitting his Hubble proposal under [[peer review]], Brown submitted his proposal directly to one of Hubble's operators, who promptly allocated time to Brown.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"HST-9678\"/> While setting up the observing algorithm for Hubble, Brown had also planned to use one of the [[Keck telescopes]] in [[Mauna Kea, Hawaii]], as a part of a study on [[cryovolcanism]] on the [[Moons of Uranus|moons]] of [[Uranus]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> This provided him additional time for follow-up observations and took advantage of the whole observing session in July to analyze Quaoar's [[spectrum]] and characterize its surface composition.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/>\n\nThe discovery of Quaoar was formally announced by the [[Minor Planet Center]] in a [[Minor Planet Center#Publications|Minor Planet Electronic Circular]] on 7 October 2002.<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> It was given the [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2002 LM|60}}, indicating that its discovery took place during the first half of June 2001.<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/><ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/> Quaoar was the 1,512nd object discovered in the first half of May, as indicated by the preceding letter and numbers in its provisional designation.{{efn|In the convention for minor planet provisional designations, the first letter represents the half-month of the year of discovery while the second letter and numbers indicate the order of discovery within that half-month.

They announced Quaoar was the largest Kuiper belt object found yet, surpassing previous record holders [[20000 Varuna]] and {{mpl|2002 AW|197}}.<ref name=\"hubblesite\"/><ref name=\"Trujillo2003\"/> Quaoar's discovery has been cited as Brown as having contributed to the [[2006 definition of planet|reclassification of Pluto]] as a dwarf planet.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Since then, Brown has contributed to the discovery of larger trans-Neptunian objects, including [[Haumea]], {{dp|Eris}}, [[Makemake]], and {{dp|Gonggong}}.\n\n=== Naming ===\nUpon Quaoar's discovery, it was initially given the temporary nickname \"Object X\" as a reference to Planet X, due to its potentially large size and unknown nature.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> At the time, Quaoar's size was uncertain, and its high brightness led the discovery team to speculate that it may be a possible tenth planet. After measuring Quaoar's size with the Hubble Space Telescope in July, the team began considering names for the object, particularly those from [[New World]] mythologies.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Following the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s (IAU's) [[planetary nomenclature|naming convention]] for [[minor planet]]s, non-resonant Kuiper belt objects are to be named after [[Creator deity|creation deities]].<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/> The team settled on selecting names from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythologies local to the Palomar Mountain region, the location where they discovered Quaoar. Through [[Internet search]]ing, the team eventually decided upon the name ''[[Quaoar (mythology)|Kwawar]]'', the creator god of the [[Tongva people]] indigenous to the area around [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> The Tongva were the first inhabitants of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], where Michael Brown's institute, the [[California Institute of Technology]], is located.<ref name=\"caltech\"/>\n\nIn Tongva mythology, Kwawar (or Quaoar) is the creation force of the universe, singing and dancing deities into existence.<ref name=\"Schmadel2006\"/> Quaoar has no form or gender, although the deity is generally referred to with masculine pronouns.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> He first sings and dances to create Weywot (Sky Father), then they sing Chehooit (Earth Mother) and Tamit (Grandfather Sun) into existence. As they sang and danced deities into existence, the creation force became more complex as each joined the singing and dancing. Eventually, after reducing chaos to order, they created the great seven giants that upheld the world.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"hubblesite\"/> They then gave rise to the lower animals and eventually the first man and woman, Tobohar and Pahavit.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/>\n\nUpon their investigation of names from Tongva mythology, Brown and Trujillo realized that there were existing members of the Tongva and considered contacting them for permission.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> They consulted tribal historian Marc Acu\u00f1a, who suggested that the name ''Kwawar'' was appropriate for the newly-discovered object.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> The name was then changed to ''Qua-o-ar'' as this spelling was preferred among the Tongva.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> However, the name's spelling was later reconsidered by Brown due to its ambiguous pronunciation resulting from the four-vowel combination ''uaoa''\u2014no other word in the English language has this particular combination of vowels.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/>{{efn|name=dict-def}} (Indeed, even if one takes the ''u'' to be part of the initial consonant ''qu'', no other word in English has the vowel sequence ''aoa'', though it occurs in the place name [[Paraoa]].) Regardless, the name and discovery of Quaoar were publicly announced in October, though Brown had not sought approval of the name by the IAU's [[Committee on Small Body Nomenclature]] (CSBN).<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Quaoar's name was announced before the official numbering of the object, which [[Brian G. Marsden|Brian Marsden]]\u2014the head of the Minor Planet Center\u2014remarked in 2004 to be a violation of the protocol during the time that the name of {{dp|Sedna}}\u2014another large trans-Neptunian object discovered by Brown\u2014was announced.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"MPEC-2004-S73\"/> Despite this, the name was approved by the CSBN, and the naming citation, along with Quaoar's official numbering, was published in a [[Minor Planet Circular]] on 20 November 2002.<ref name=\"MPC47066\"/>\n\nQuaoar was given the [[minor planet number]] 50000, which was not by coincidence but to commemorate its large size, being that it was found in the search for a Pluto-sized object in the Kuiper belt.<ref name=\"MPC47066\"/> The large Kuiper belt object 20000 Varuna has been similarly numbered for a similar occasion.<ref name=\"MPC41805\"/> However, subsequent even larger discoveries such as [[136199 Eris]] were simply numbered according to the order in which their orbits were confirmed.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Quaoar-red-ssc2004-05c (edit).jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of Quaoar's moderately red surface along with its moon Weywot.]]\nQuaoar's [[albedo]] or reflectivity could be as low as 0.1, similar to {{dp|Varuna}}'s albedo of 0.127.<ref name=\"TNOsCool9\"/> This may indicate that fresh ice has disappeared from Quaoar's surface.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> The surface is moderately red, meaning that Quaoar is relatively more reflective in the red and near-infrared spectrum than in the blue.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> The Kuiper belt objects Varuna and {{dp|Ixion}} are also moderately red in the spectral class. Larger Kuiper belt objects are often much brighter because they are covered in more fresh ice and have a higher albedo, and thus they present a neutral color.<ref name=\"Brown2008\"/> A 2006 model of internal heating via [[radioactive decay]] suggested that, unlike [[90482 Orcus]], Quaoar may not be capable of sustaining an [[internal ocean]] of liquid water at the mantle\u2013core boundary.<ref name=\"Hussman2006\"/>\n\nThe presence of methane and other [[volatiles]] on Quaoar's surface suggest that it may support a tenuous [[atmosphere]] produced from the [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of volatiles.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> With a measured mean temperature of ~&thinsp;{{convert|44|K|C}}, the upper limit of Quaoar's [[atmospheric pressure]] is expected to be in the range of a few [[bar (pressure)|microbar]]s.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> Due to Quaoar's small size and mass, the possibility of Quaoar having an atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] has been ruled out, since the gases would escape from Quaoar.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> The possibility of a methane atmosphere, with the upper limit being less than 1 microbar,<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> was considered until 2013, when Quaoar [[occulted]] a 15.8 magnitude star and revealed no sign of a substantial atmosphere, placing an upper limit to at least 20 nanobars, under the assumption that Quaoar's mean temperature is {{convert|42|K|C}} and that its atmosphere consists of mostly methane.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> The upper limit of atmosphere pressure was tightened to 10 nanobars after another stellar occultation in 2019.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n\n=== Mass and density ===\nBecause Quaoar is a [[Minor-planet moon|binary]] object, the mass of the system can be calculated from the orbit of the secondary. Quaoar's estimated density of around {{val|2.2|u=g/cm3}} and estimated size of {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} suggests that it is a [[dwarf planet]]. American astronomer [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] estimates that rocky bodies around {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter relax into [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and that icy bodies relax into hydrostatic equilibrium somewhere between {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Brown-DP\"/> With an estimated mass greater than {{val|1.6|e=21|u=kg}}, Quaoar has the mass and diameter \"usually\" required for being in hydrostatic equilibrium according to the [[IAU definition of planet#Draft proposal|2006 IAU draft definition of a planet]] (5{{e|20}} kg, 800&nbsp;km),<ref name=\"IAU0601\"/> and Brown states that Quaoar \"must be\" a [[dwarf planet]].<ref name=\"Brown-dplist\"/> Light-curve-amplitude analysis shows only small deviations, suggesting that Quaoar is indeed a spheroid with small albedo spots and hence a dwarf planet.<ref name=\"Tancredi2008\"/>\n\nPlanetary scientist [[Erik Ian Asphaug|Erik Asphaug]] has suggested that Quaoar may have collided with a much larger body, stripping the lower-density mantle from Quaoar, and leaving behind the denser core. He envisioned that Quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} bigger than its present size, and that it collided with another Kuiper belt object about twice its size\u2014an object roughly the diameter of Pluto, or even approaching the size of [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Musser2009\"/> This model was made assuming Quaoar actually had a density of 4.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, but more recent estimates have given it a more Pluto-like density of only 2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, with no more need for the collision theory.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/>\n\n=== Size ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-right: 12px;\"\n|+ Size estimates for Quaoar\n!Year!!Diameter (km)!!Method!!Refs\n|-\n|2004\n|{{val|1260|190}}\n|imaging\n|<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/>\n|-\n|2007\n|{{val|844|207|190}}\n|thermal\n|<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/>\n|-\n|2010\n|{{val|890|70}}\n|thermal/imaging\n|<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/>\n|-\n|2013\n|{{val|1074|138}}\n|thermal\n|<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/>\n|-\n|2013\n|{{val|1110|5}}\n|occultation\n|<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/>\n|-\n|2019\n|{{val|1121|1.2}}\n|occultation\n|<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n|}\n[[File:Quaoar hubble.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hubble photo used to measure size of Quaoar]]\n[[File:Quaoar, Earth & Moon size comparison.png|thumb|upright|right|Quaoar compared to the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]].]]\n\nQuaoar is thought to be an [[oblate spheroid]] around {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, being slightly flattened in shape.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/><ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> The estimates come from observations of [[stellar occultation]]s by Quaoar, in which it passes in front of a star, in 2013 and 2019.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/> Given that Quaoar has an estimated [[oblateness]] of {{val|0.0897|0.006}} and a measured equatorial diameter of {{val|1138|+48|-34|u=km}}, Quaoar is believed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, being described as a [[Maclaurin spheroid]].<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> Quaoar is about as large and massive as (if somewhat smaller than) Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].{{efn|name=mass|Charon's mass is {{val|1.586|0.015|e=21|u=kg}}<ref name=\"Stern2018\"/> while Quaoar's mass is {{val|1.4|0.1|e=21|u=kg}}.<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/> Both values are approximately similar, though Charon is slightly more massive. In a similar case, Charon's diameter is {{val|1212|1|u=km}} while Quaoar's diameter is {{val|1121|1.2|u=km}}, being slightly smaller than Charon.}} Quaoar is roughly half the size of Pluto.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/>\n\nQuaoar was the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] to be measured ''directly'' from [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images, using a method comparing images with the Hubble [[point spread function]] (PSF).<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> In 2004, Quaoar was estimated to have a diameter of {{convert|1260|km|mi|abbr=on}} with an uncertainty of {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=on}}, using Hubble's measurements.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/><ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2011\"/> Given its distance Quaoar is on the limit of Hubble's resolution of 40 [[Minute of arc|milliarcseconds]] and its image is consequently \"smeared\" on a few adjacent pixels.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> By comparing carefully this image with the images of stars in the background and using a sophisticated model of Hubble optics (PSF), Brown and Trujillo were able to find the best-fit disk size that would give a similar blurred image.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> This method was also applied by the same authors to measure the size of the dwarf planet Eris.<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/>\n\nAt the time of its discovery in 2002, Quaoar was the largest object found in the [[Solar System]] since the discovery of [[Pluto]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Quaoar's size was subsequently revised downward and was later superseded in size as larger objects ({{dp|Eris}}, {{dp|Haumea}},  {{dp|Makemake}} and {{dp|Gonggong}}) were discovered. The uncorrected 2004 Hubble estimates only marginally agree with the 2007 [[infrared]] measurements by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] that suggest a higher [[albedo]] (0.19) and consequently a smaller diameter ({{val|844.4|+206.7|-189.6|u=km}}).<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/> Adopting a Uranian satellite [[limb darkening]] profile suggests that the 2004 Hubble size estimate for Quaoar was approximately 40 percent too large, and that a more proper estimate would be about 900&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> In 2010, Quaoar was estimated to be about {{val|890|u=km}} in diameter, using a weighted average of Spitzer and corrected Hubble estimates.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> In observations of the object's shadow as it occulted an unnamed 16th-magnitude star on 4 May 2011, Quaoar was estimated to be {{convert|1170|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2011\"/> Measurements from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] in 2013 suggested that Quaoar has a diameter of {{convert|1070|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/> In that same year, Quaoar occulted a 15.8 magnitude star, yielding a [[chord (astronomy)|chord]] length of {{val|1100|5|u=km}}, consistent with the Herschel estimate.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> Another occultation by Quaoar in June 2019 also yielded a similar chord length of {{val|1121|1.2|u=km}}.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n\n=== Cryovolcanism ===\nIn 2004, signs of [[crystal]]line [[ice]] were found on Quaoar, indicating that the temperature rose to at least {{convert|110|K|C}} sometime in the last ten million years.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> Speculation began as to what could have caused Quaoar to heat up from its natural temperature of {{convert|55|K|C}}. Some have theorized that a barrage of mini-[[meteor]]s may have raised the temperature, but the most discussed theory speculates that [[Cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]] may be occurring, spurred by the decay of [[radioactive]] elements within Quaoar's core.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> Since then (2006), crystalline water ice was also found on {{dp|Haumea}}, but present in larger quantities and thought to be responsible for the very high albedo of that object (0.7).<ref name=\"Trujillo2007\"/> More precise observations of Quaoar's near [[infrared spectrum]] in 2007 indicated the presence of small quantities (5%) of solid [[methane]] and [[ethane]]. Given its [[boiling point]] of {{convert|112|K|C}}, methane is a volatile ice at average surface temperatures of Quaoar, unlike water ice or ethane. Both models and observations suggest that only a few larger bodies ([[Pluto]], {{dp|Eris}}, and {{dp|Makemake}}) can retain the volatile ices whereas the dominant population of small [[Trans-Neptunian object|TNOs]] lost them. Quaoar, with only small amounts of methane, appears to be in an intermediary category.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/>\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n[[File:Cubewanos.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Polar view of Quaoar's orbit (yellow) along with various other large Kuiper belt objects]]\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Quaoar.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ecliptic]] view of Quaoar's orbit (blue) compared to Pluto (red) and Neptune (white).

It measures approximately {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, about half the diameter of [[Pluto]]. The object was discovered by American astronomers [[Chad Trujillo]] and [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] on 4 June 2002.<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> Signs of water ice on the surface of Quaoar have been found, which suggests that [[cryovolcanism]] may be occurring on Quaoar.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> A small amount of [[methane]] is present on its surface, which can only be retained by the largest Kuiper belt objects.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/> In February 2007, [[Weywot (moon)|Weywot]], a synchronous moon in orbit around Quaoar, was discovered by Brown.<ref name=\"IAUC8812\"/> Weywot is measured to be {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.<ref name=\"JOA2020-1\"/> Both objects were named after mythological figures from the Native American [[Tongva people]] in Southern California.

Brown|Michael Brown]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]] in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> The discovery formed part of the Caltech Wide Area Sky Survey, which was designed to search for the brightest [[Kuiper belt object]]s using the Palomar Observatory's 1.22-meter [[Samuel Oschin telescope]].<ref name=\"Trujillo2003\"/> Quaoar was first identified in images by Trujillo on 5 June 2002, when he noticed a dim, 18.6-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] object slowly moving among the stars of the [[constellation]] [[Ophiuchus]].<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> Quaoar appeared relatively bright for a distant object, suggesting that it could have a size comparable to the diameter of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]].<ref name=\"nasascience\"/>\n\nTo ascertain Quaoar's orbit, Brown and Trujillo initiated a search for archival [[precovery]] images. They obtained several precovery images taken by the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] survey from various observatories in 1996 and 2000\u20132002.<ref name=\"precovery\"/> In particular, they had also found two archival [[photographic plate]]s taken by astronomer [[Charles T. Kowal]] in May 1983,<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> who at the time was searching for the hypothesized [[Planet X]] at the Palomar Observatory.<ref name=\"caltech\"/><ref name=\"NYT-20021008\"/> From these precovery images, Brown and Trujillo were able to calculate Quaoar's orbit and distance. Additional precovery images of Quaoar have been later identified, with the earliest known found on a photographic plate imaged on 25 May 1954 from the [[Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]].<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/><ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n\nBefore announcing the discovery of Quaoar, Brown had planned to conduct follow-up observations using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] to measure Quaoar's size.<ref name=\"hubblesite\"/> He had also planned to announce the discovery as soon as possible and found it necessary to keep the discovery information confidential during the follow-up observations.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Rather than submitting his Hubble proposal under [[peer review]], Brown submitted his proposal directly to one of Hubble's operators, who promptly allocated time to Brown.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"HST-9678\"/> While setting up the observing algorithm for Hubble, Brown had also planned to use one of the [[Keck telescopes]] in [[Mauna Kea, Hawaii]], as a part of a study on [[cryovolcanism]] on the [[Moons of Uranus|moons]] of [[Uranus]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> This provided him additional time for follow-up observations and took advantage of the whole observing session in July to analyze Quaoar's [[spectrum]] and characterize its surface composition.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/>\n\nThe discovery of Quaoar was formally announced by the [[Minor Planet Center]] in a [[Minor Planet Center#Publications|Minor Planet Electronic Circular]] on 7 October 2002.<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/> It was given the [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2002 LM|60}}, indicating that its discovery took place during the first half of June 2001.<ref name=\"MPEC-2002-T34\"/><ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/> Quaoar was the 1,512nd object discovered in the first half of May, as indicated by the preceding letter and numbers in its provisional designation.{{efn|In the convention for minor planet provisional designations, the first letter represents the half-month of the year of discovery while the second letter and numbers indicate the order of discovery within that half-month. In the case for {{mp|2002 LM|60}}, the first letter 'L' corresponds to the first half-month of May 2002 while the preceding letter 'M' indicates that it is the 12th object discovered on the 61st cycle of discoveries (with 60 cycles completed). Each completed cycle consists of 25 letters representing discoveries, hence 12&thinsp;+&thinsp;(60 completed cycles \u00d7 25 letters)&thinsp;{{=}}&thinsp;1,512.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>}} On that same day, Trujillo and Brown reported their scientific results from observations of Quaoar at the 34th annual meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]]'s [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. They announced Quaoar was the largest Kuiper belt object found yet, surpassing previous record holders [[20000 Varuna]] and {{mpl|2002 AW|197}}.<ref name=\"hubblesite\"/><ref name=\"Trujillo2003\"/> Quaoar's discovery has been cited as Brown as having contributed to the [[2006 definition of planet|reclassification of Pluto]] as a dwarf planet.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Since then, Brown has contributed to the discovery of larger trans-Neptunian objects, including [[Haumea]], {{dp|Eris}}, [[Makemake]], and {{dp|Gonggong}}.\n\n=== Naming ===\nUpon Quaoar's discovery, it was initially given the temporary nickname \"Object X\" as a reference to Planet X, due to its potentially large size and unknown nature.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> At the time, Quaoar's size was uncertain, and its high brightness led the discovery team to speculate that it may be a possible tenth planet. After measuring Quaoar's size with the Hubble Space Telescope in July, the team began considering names for the object, particularly those from [[New World]] mythologies.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Following the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s (IAU's) [[planetary nomenclature|naming convention]] for [[minor planet]]s, non-resonant Kuiper belt objects are to be named after [[Creator deity|creation deities]].<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/> The team settled on selecting names from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythologies local to the Palomar Mountain region, the location where they discovered Quaoar. Through [[Internet search]]ing, the team eventually decided upon the name ''[[Quaoar (mythology)|Kwawar]]'', the creator god of the [[Tongva people]] indigenous to the area around [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> The Tongva were the first inhabitants of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], where Michael Brown's institute, the [[California Institute of Technology]], is located.<ref name=\"caltech\"/>\n\nIn Tongva mythology, Kwawar (or Quaoar) is the creation force of the universe, singing and dancing deities into existence.<ref name=\"Schmadel2006\"/> Quaoar has no form or gender, although the deity is generally referred to with masculine pronouns.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> He first sings and dances to create Weywot (Sky Father), then they sing Chehooit (Earth Mother) and Tamit (Grandfather Sun) into existence. As they sang and danced deities into existence, the creation force became more complex as each joined the singing and dancing. Eventually, after reducing chaos to order, they created the great seven giants that upheld the world.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"hubblesite\"/> They then gave rise to the lower animals and eventually the first man and woman, Tobohar and Pahavit.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/>\n\nUpon their investigation of names from Tongva mythology, Brown and Trujillo realized that there were existing members of the Tongva and considered contacting them for permission.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> They consulted tribal historian Marc Acu\u00f1a, who suggested that the name ''Kwawar'' was appropriate for the newly-discovered object.<ref name=\"FAQ-Quaoar\"/><ref name=\"Street2008\"/> The name was then changed to ''Qua-o-ar'' as this spelling was preferred among the Tongva.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> However, the name's spelling was later reconsidered by Brown due to its ambiguous pronunciation resulting from the four-vowel combination ''uaoa''\u2014no other word in the English language has this particular combination of vowels.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/>{{efn|name=dict-def}} (Indeed, even if one takes the ''u'' to be part of the initial consonant ''qu'', no other word in English has the vowel sequence ''aoa'', though it occurs in the place name [[Paraoa]].) Regardless, the name and discovery of Quaoar were publicly announced in October, though Brown had not sought approval of the name by the IAU's [[Committee on Small Body Nomenclature]] (CSBN).<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Quaoar's name was announced before the official numbering of the object, which [[Brian G. Marsden|Brian Marsden]]\u2014the head of the Minor Planet Center\u2014remarked in 2004 to be a violation of the protocol during the time that the name of {{dp|Sedna}}\u2014another large trans-Neptunian object discovered by Brown\u2014was announced.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/><ref name=\"MPEC-2004-S73\"/> Despite this, the name was approved by the CSBN, and the naming citation, along with Quaoar's official numbering, was published in a [[Minor Planet Circular]] on 20 November 2002.<ref name=\"MPC47066\"/>\n\nQuaoar was given the [[minor planet number]] 50000, which was not by coincidence but to commemorate its large size, being that it was found in the search for a Pluto-sized object in the Kuiper belt.<ref name=\"MPC47066\"/> The large Kuiper belt object 20000 Varuna has been similarly numbered for a similar occasion.<ref name=\"MPC41805\"/> However, subsequent even larger discoveries such as [[136199 Eris]] were simply numbered according to the order in which their orbits were confirmed.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Quaoar-red-ssc2004-05c (edit).jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of Quaoar's moderately red surface along with its moon Weywot.]]\nQuaoar's [[albedo]] or reflectivity could be as low as 0.1, similar to {{dp|Varuna}}'s albedo of 0.127.<ref name=\"TNOsCool9\"/> This may indicate that fresh ice has disappeared from Quaoar's surface.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> The surface is moderately red, meaning that Quaoar is relatively more reflective in the red and near-infrared spectrum than in the blue.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> The Kuiper belt objects Varuna and {{dp|Ixion}} are also moderately red in the spectral class. Larger Kuiper belt objects are often much brighter because they are covered in more fresh ice and have a higher albedo, and thus they present a neutral color.<ref name=\"Brown2008\"/> A 2006 model of internal heating via [[radioactive decay]] suggested that, unlike [[90482 Orcus]], Quaoar may not be capable of sustaining an [[internal ocean]] of liquid water at the mantle\u2013core boundary.<ref name=\"Hussman2006\"/>\n\nThe presence of methane and other [[volatiles]] on Quaoar's surface suggest that it may support a tenuous [[atmosphere]] produced from the [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of volatiles.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> With a measured mean temperature of ~&thinsp;{{convert|44|K|C}}, the upper limit of Quaoar's [[atmospheric pressure]] is expected to be in the range of a few [[bar (pressure)|microbar]]s.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> Due to Quaoar's small size and mass, the possibility of Quaoar having an atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] has been ruled out, since the gases would escape from Quaoar.<ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> The possibility of a methane atmosphere, with the upper limit being less than 1 microbar,<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> was considered until 2013, when Quaoar [[occulted]] a 15.8 magnitude star and revealed no sign of a substantial atmosphere, placing an upper limit to at least 20 nanobars, under the assumption that Quaoar's mean temperature is {{convert|42|K|C}} and that its atmosphere consists of mostly methane.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Fraser2013b\"/> The upper limit of atmosphere pressure was tightened to 10 nanobars after another stellar occultation in 2019.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n\n=== Mass and density ===\nBecause Quaoar is a [[Minor-planet moon|binary]] object, the mass of the system can be calculated from the orbit of the secondary. Quaoar's estimated density of around {{val|2.2|u=g/cm3}} and estimated size of {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} suggests that it is a [[dwarf planet]]. American astronomer [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] estimates that rocky bodies around {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter relax into [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and that icy bodies relax into hydrostatic equilibrium somewhere between {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Brown-DP\"/> With an estimated mass greater than {{val|1.6|e=21|u=kg}}, Quaoar has the mass and diameter \"usually\" required for being in hydrostatic equilibrium according to the [[IAU definition of planet#Draft proposal|2006 IAU draft definition of a planet]] (5{{e|20}} kg, 800&nbsp;km),<ref name=\"IAU0601\"/> and Brown states that Quaoar \"must be\" a [[dwarf planet]].<ref name=\"Brown-dplist\"/> Light-curve-amplitude analysis shows only small deviations, suggesting that Quaoar is indeed a spheroid with small albedo spots and hence a dwarf planet.<ref name=\"Tancredi2008\"/>\n\nPlanetary scientist [[Erik Ian Asphaug|Erik Asphaug]] has suggested that Quaoar may have collided with a much larger body, stripping the lower-density mantle from Quaoar, and leaving behind the denser core. He envisioned that Quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} bigger than its present size, and that it collided with another Kuiper belt object about twice its size\u2014an object roughly the diameter of Pluto, or even approaching the size of [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Musser2009\"/> This model was made assuming Quaoar actually had a density of 4.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, but more recent estimates have given it a more Pluto-like density of only 2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, with no more need for the collision theory.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/>\n\n=== Size ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-right: 12px;\"\n|+ Size estimates for Quaoar\n!Year!!Diameter (km)!!Method!!Refs\n|-\n|2004\n|{{val|1260|190}}\n|imaging\n|<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/>\n|-\n|2007\n|{{val|844|207|190}}\n|thermal\n|<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/>\n|-\n|2010\n|{{val|890|70}}\n|thermal/imaging\n|<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/>\n|-\n|2013\n|{{val|1074|138}}\n|thermal\n|<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/>\n|-\n|2013\n|{{val|1110|5}}\n|occultation\n|<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/>\n|-\n|2019\n|{{val|1121|1.2}}\n|occultation\n|<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n|}\n[[File:Quaoar hubble.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hubble photo used to measure size of Quaoar]]\n[[File:Quaoar, Earth & Moon size comparison.png|thumb|upright|right|Quaoar compared to the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]].]]\n\nQuaoar is thought to be an [[oblate spheroid]] around {{convert|1121|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, being slightly flattened in shape.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/><ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> The estimates come from observations of [[stellar occultation]]s by Quaoar, in which it passes in front of a star, in 2013 and 2019.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/><ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/> Given that Quaoar has an estimated [[oblateness]] of {{val|0.0897|0.006}} and a measured equatorial diameter of {{val|1138|+48|-34|u=km}}, Quaoar is believed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, being described as a [[Maclaurin spheroid]].<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> Quaoar is about as large and massive as (if somewhat smaller than) Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].{{efn|name=mass|Charon's mass is {{val|1.586|0.015|e=21|u=kg}}<ref name=\"Stern2018\"/> while Quaoar's mass is {{val|1.4|0.1|e=21|u=kg}}.<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/> Both values are approximately similar, though Charon is slightly more massive. In a similar case, Charon's diameter is {{val|1212|1|u=km}} while Quaoar's diameter is {{val|1121|1.2|u=km}}, being slightly smaller than Charon.}} Quaoar is roughly half the size of Pluto.<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/>\n\nQuaoar was the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] to be measured ''directly'' from [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images, using a method comparing images with the Hubble [[point spread function]] (PSF).<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> In 2004, Quaoar was estimated to have a diameter of {{convert|1260|km|mi|abbr=on}} with an uncertainty of {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=on}}, using Hubble's measurements.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/><ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2011\"/> Given its distance Quaoar is on the limit of Hubble's resolution of 40 [[Minute of arc|milliarcseconds]] and its image is consequently \"smeared\" on a few adjacent pixels.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> By comparing carefully this image with the images of stars in the background and using a sophisticated model of Hubble optics (PSF), Brown and Trujillo were able to find the best-fit disk size that would give a similar blurred image.<ref name=\"Brown2004\"/> This method was also applied by the same authors to measure the size of the dwarf planet Eris.<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/>\n\nAt the time of its discovery in 2002, Quaoar was the largest object found in the [[Solar System]] since the discovery of [[Pluto]].<ref name=\"plutokiller\"/> Quaoar's size was subsequently revised downward and was later superseded in size as larger objects ({{dp|Eris}}, {{dp|Haumea}},  {{dp|Makemake}} and {{dp|Gonggong}}) were discovered. The uncorrected 2004 Hubble estimates only marginally agree with the 2007 [[infrared]] measurements by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] that suggest a higher [[albedo]] (0.19) and consequently a smaller diameter ({{val|844.4|+206.7|-189.6|u=km}}).<ref name=\"Stansberry2008\"/> Adopting a Uranian satellite [[limb darkening]] profile suggests that the 2004 Hubble size estimate for Quaoar was approximately 40 percent too large, and that a more proper estimate would be about 900&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> In 2010, Quaoar was estimated to be about {{val|890|u=km}} in diameter, using a weighted average of Spitzer and corrected Hubble estimates.<ref name=\"Fraser2010\"/> In observations of the object's shadow as it occulted an unnamed 16th-magnitude star on 4 May 2011, Quaoar was estimated to be {{convert|1170|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2011\"/> Measurements from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] in 2013 suggested that Quaoar has a diameter of {{convert|1070|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"TNOsCool8\"/> In that same year, Quaoar occulted a 15.8 magnitude star, yielding a [[chord (astronomy)|chord]] length of {{val|1100|5|u=km}}, consistent with the Herschel estimate.<ref name=\"Braga-Ribas2013\"/> Another occultation by Quaoar in June 2019 also yielded a similar chord length of {{val|1121|1.2|u=km}}.<ref name=\"Arimatsu2019\"/>\n\n=== Cryovolcanism ===\nIn 2004, signs of [[crystal]]line [[ice]] were found on Quaoar, indicating that the temperature rose to at least {{convert|110|K|C}} sometime in the last ten million years.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> Speculation began as to what could have caused Quaoar to heat up from its natural temperature of {{convert|55|K|C}}. Some have theorized that a barrage of mini-[[meteor]]s may have raised the temperature, but the most discussed theory speculates that [[Cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]] may be occurring, spurred by the decay of [[radioactive]] elements within Quaoar's core.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\"/> Since then (2006), crystalline water ice was also found on {{dp|Haumea}}, but present in larger quantities and thought to be responsible for the very high albedo of that object (0.7).<ref name=\"Trujillo2007\"/> More precise observations of Quaoar's near [[infrared spectrum]] in 2007 indicated the presence of small quantities (5%) of solid [[methane]] and [[ethane]]. Given its [[boiling point]] of {{convert|112|K|C}}, methane is a volatile ice at average surface temperatures of Quaoar, unlike water ice or ethane. Both models and observations suggest that only a few larger bodies ([[Pluto]], {{dp|Eris}}, and {{dp|Makemake}}) can retain the volatile ices whereas the dominant population of small [[Trans-Neptunian object|TNOs]] lost them. Quaoar, with only small amounts of methane, appears to be in an intermediary category.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/>\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n[[File:Cubewanos.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Polar view of Quaoar's orbit (yellow) along with various other large Kuiper belt objects]]\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Quaoar.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ecliptic]] view of Quaoar's orbit (blue) compared to Pluto (red) and Neptune (white).

(2007)]]\nEnvoy began as a collection of regional carriers with contracts to carry the American Eagle brand name.  The first American Eagle flight was operated by [[Metroflight Airlines]], which was a wholly owned subsidiary of '''Metro Airlines''' (formerly '''Houston Metro Airlines'''), on November 1, 1984, from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]] and [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. Metroflight utilized Convair 580 turboprop aircraft that had been formerly operated by Frontier Airlines.  Other carriers that have flown in [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] livery include [[Executive Airlines]], [[Command Airways]], Air Virginia, [[Simmons Airlines]], Chaparral Airlines and [[Wings West Airlines]]. Among other aircraft in its fleet, Chaparral flew Grumman I-C turboprops which were stretched, 37 passenger regional airliner versions of Grumman's successful propjet business aircraft and was one of only a few air carriers to ever operate the type in scheduled passenger service.\n\nUntil 1987 these third-party carriers flew under contract with [[American Airlines]] to provide regional feed to its hubs. During 1987 and 1988 AMR Corp. acquired its regional carriers, starting with Simmons Airlines.  AMR's final airline [[d/b/a]] American Eagle acquisition was Executive Airlines in 1989.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eKe4Iok06H4C&pg=PA140&dq=american+eagle+1987+airline#v=onepage|title=Growth from Chaos: Developing Your Firm's Resources to Achieve Profitability Without Cost Cutting|first=Michael L.|last=Pettus|date=June 19, 2017|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567206333|access-date=June 19, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1991 AMR had consolidated the number of carriers to four.  The May 15, 1998, merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons (and the name change of Simmons Airlines to American Eagle Airlines) reduced the number of carriers flying as American Eagle under separate operating certificates to two:  American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc.\n\nDuring 2007, AMR began studying ways to spin American Eagle Airlines off into a separate company, including, but not limited to, the possibilities of selling the company to either stockholders or to an unaffiliated third party.

Among other aircraft in its fleet, Chaparral flew Grumman I-C turboprops which were stretched, 37 passenger regional airliner versions of Grumman's successful propjet business aircraft and was one of only a few air carriers to ever operate the type in scheduled passenger service.\n\nUntil 1987 these third-party carriers flew under contract with [[American Airlines]] to provide regional feed to its hubs. During 1987 and 1988 AMR Corp. acquired its regional carriers, starting with Simmons Airlines.  AMR's final airline [[d/b/a]] American Eagle acquisition was Executive Airlines in 1989.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eKe4Iok06H4C&pg=PA140&dq=american+eagle+1987+airline#v=onepage|title=Growth from Chaos: Developing Your Firm's Resources to Achieve Profitability Without Cost Cutting|first=Michael L.|last=Pettus|date=June 19, 2017|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567206333|access-date=June 19, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1991 AMR had consolidated the number of carriers to four.  The May 15, 1998, merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons (and the name change of Simmons Airlines to American Eagle Airlines) reduced the number of carriers flying as American Eagle under separate operating certificates to two:  American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc.\n\nDuring 2007, AMR began studying ways to spin American Eagle Airlines off into a separate company, including, but not limited to, the possibilities of selling the company to either stockholders or to an unaffiliated third party.  In 2008, AMR said any plans had been put on hold until the airline industry stabilized after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|worldwide financial crisis]].  In July 2011, AMR announced the spin-off of American Eagle Airlines but those plans were again put on hold when Parent AMR Corp. filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In 2014 the company changed its name to Envoy Air Inc., but American Eagle continues to live on as a brand, as well as livery for Envoy-operated and third party-operated regional flights.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n|+ American Eagle carriers\n|-\n!Carrier\n!Eagle service began\n!Acquired by AMR\n!Eagle service ended\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Metro Airlines|Metroflight Airlines]] (formerly Metro Airlines)\n|{{nobreak|November 1, 1984}}\n|May 28, 1993\n|May 28, 1993\n|Bankrupt;  assets acquired by Simmons Airlines<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=2233 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|AVAir (formerly Air Virginia)\n|May 15, 1985\n|May 1988\n|May 1988\n|Bankrupt;  assets acquired by Nashville Eagle<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=2417 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Simmons Airlines]]\n|October 1, 1985\n|August 1, 1987\n|May 15, 1998\n|Merged with Flagship and Wings West to form American Eagle Airlines<ref name = \"sm\">[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=1515 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Command Airways]]\n|April 27, 1986\n|{{nobreak|September 28, 1988}}\n|June 1, 1991\n|Merged into Nashville Eagle to form Flagship Airlines<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=2422 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Wings West Airlines|Wings West]]\n|June 1986\n|August 9, 1987\n|May 15, 1998\n|Merged into Simmons to form American Eagle Airlines, Inc.<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=1522 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Executive Airlines]]\n|November 1, 1986\n|1990<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=2423 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|{{nobreak|March 31, 2013}}\n|San Juan (SJU) American Eagle hub shut down with ATR-72 turboprop aircraft phased out of fleet\n|-\n|Nashville Eagle\n|January 1988\n|January 1988\n|June 1, 1991\n|Merged with Command Airways to form Flagship Airlines<ref name=\"ne\">[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=2416 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Flagship Airlines]]\n|June 1, 1991\n|June 1, 1991\n|May 15, 1998\n|Formed by the merger of Command Airways into Nashville Eagle;  merged into Simmons to form American Eagle Airlines, Inc.<ref>[http://rzjets.net/operators/update.php?opid=459 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|American Eagle Airlines\n|May 15, 1998\n|May 15, 1998\n|Apr 15, 2014\n|Formed by the merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons<ref name = \"sm\" />\n|-\n|Envoy Air\n|Apr 15, 2014\n|May 15, 1998\n|Still Operating\n|American Eagle Airlines rebranded to Envoy\n|}\n* In January 1988, Nashville Eagle became AMR Corp.\u2019s first and only start-up airline, using equipment acquired from Air Midwest.<ref name = \"ne\" />\n* American Eagle Airlines launched its [[regional jet]] service in May 1998 using [[Embraer ERJ 145 family|Embraer ERJ 145]] aircraft.\n* [[Business Express]] was acquired by AMR Eagle Holdings Corporation in March 1999,<ref>\"Company News: American Eagle Air buying Business Express.\" ''The New York Times.''

She is shooting a news segment on [[childhood obesity]] in an elementary school cafeteria when one of the students begins to choke; after the [[choking|heimlich maneuver]] fails, she performs a cricothyrotomy with a kitchen knife and a drinking straw. It is also used many other times, especially in the trauma room, when an airway can't be established.\n\nIn the film ''[[Playing God (1997 film)|Playing God]]'' (1997), [[David Duchovny]] plays a famed LA surgeon, stripped of his license due to drug abuse, who finds himself witnessing a gunfight at a bar. He saves a mafia crime figure by performing an emergency cricothyrotomy.  This endears him with the mafia family and drives the plot forward. \n\nIn the BBC3 medical drama ''[[Bodies (TV series)|Bodies]]'', the main protagonist Rob Lake, a newly appointed obstetrics and gynaecology registrar (played by [[Max Beesley]]), is called to a patient who is having difficulty breathing due to epiglottitis. Lake calls for emergency assistance but help is slow coming, so fearing for the patient's life decides to undertake a cricothyrotomy himself - a procedure he has not been trained in. The procedure is unsuccessful and the patient dies before help arrives. The guilt surrounding the event combined with the covering up by his consultant provides an important backdrop to the further development of the character and his relationship with his consultant.\n\nOn ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; Sully, the white man raised by Native Americans who is her lover and companion, performs the procedure on one of Dr. Quinn's boys using a bird's feather (the base where it is hollow).\n\nDuring an episode of the [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary \"Inside Combat Rescue\",<ref>[http://prehospitalmed.com/2013/03/20/combat-cricothyrotomy-inflight-inside-combat-rescue-series/ Combat cricothyrotomy inflight -Inside Combat Rescue series | PHARM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a US Air Force Pararescueman in Afghanistan performs an actual cricothyrotomy on a wounded civilian in a helicopter maneuvering under combat conditions.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
