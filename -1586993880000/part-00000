It is located near the [[Melbourne City Centre]], on two campuses: one \u2013 the [[Melbourne Conservatorium of Music]] (The Conservatorium) \u2013 on the [[Parkville, Victoria|Parkville]] campus of the University of Melbourne, and the other \u2013 the [[Victorian College of the Arts]] (VCA) \u2013 on [[St Kilda Road]], at [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]].\n\nSince 2019 a large majority of the Melbourne Conservatorium has moved to the Southbank campus alongside the VCA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finearts-music.unimelb.edu.au/campus-experience|title=Faculty of Fine Arts and Music Campus Experience|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n\n==History==\nThe faculty was created in 2009 from the amalgamation of the university's faculty of music (founded as the University Conservatorium in 1895) and faculty of the Victorian College of the Arts. Founded in 1972, the VCA integrated into the University of Melbourne in 2007 as a separate faculty. Due to dissatisfaction \u2013 particularly from students of the old VCA \u2013 with the structural changes imposed by the university, in November 2009 former Telstra CEO [[Ziggy Switkowski]] was appointed to chair a review. A number of his recommendations were adopted, resulting in the resignation of the inaugural dean,<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/vca-chief-quits-amid-overhaul-20100723-10niw.html VCA chief quits amid overhaul] accessed 4 Feb. 2011</ref> abandonment of the previous push for full amalgamation, the creation of the present divisional structure with a more centralised administration and two relatively distinct teaching entities at the Parkville and Southbank campuses,<ref>http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news-article/opinions/performing-arts/vcams-new-conservatorium-of-music-181828</ref> and a change in the title of the head of the two divisions to Director.

Overactive factor H may result in reduced complement activity on pathogenic cells - increasing susceptibility to microbial infections.  Underactive factor H may result in increased complement activity on healthy host cells - resulting in autoimmune diseases.  It is not surprising therefore that [[mutations]] or [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) in factor H often result in pathologies.

It was released in September 1975 by [[United Artists Records]] and on 14 November 1975 in the United Kingdom by [[Jet Records]]. The album moves away from the large-scale classical orchestrated sound from the previous album, ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', in favor of more \"radio-friendly\" rock/pop songs, though the string sections are still very prominent. The new sound proved successful for the group as ''Face the Music'' was the first ELO album to go platinum.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftmusic.com/facethemusic/index.html|title=ELO Remaster Series - FACE THE MUSIC - INTRO|last=Greenwell|first=Ken|website=www.ftmusic.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nBy January 1975, [[Bass guitar|bass]] player [[Mike de Albuquerque]] and [[Cello|cellist]] [[Mike Edwards (musician)|Mike Edwards]] had left the band entirely during the ''Eldorado''<nowiki/>'s recording sessions and subsequent tour, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/eldoradotour/|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Electric Light Orchestra - Eldorado Tour|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Bass player [[Kelly Groucutt]] and classically-trained cellist [[Melvyn Gale]] both joined the band in full as their replacements. Following the conclusion of the Eldorado's European leg of the tour, the band began recording the new album at [[Musicland Studios]] in [[Munich|Munich, Germany]]. This was the first time ELO recorded at Musicland and the band would later return to record most of the future albums here due to [[Lead vocalist|frontman]] Jeff Lynne's great fondness for it and his working relationship with sound engineer [[Reinhold Mack|Mack]].\n\nLynne, also the band's sole songwriter, wanted to move towards more tunes that would be memorable rather than the usual prog-rock style of the group's first three albums and straight symphonic sound of the ''Eldorado''. New measures were taken to ensure a more-complex but satisfying sound, such as backing female vocalists of [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Collins, Nancy O'Neill and Marge Raymond, a choir, and the band's string trio of [[Mik Kaminski]], [[Hugh McDowell]] and Melvyn Gale mixed into the backing 30-piece string section and also allowing them to perform solo bits on some of the records.<ref name=\":0\" /> While Lynne was the lead vocalist for a vast majority of the band's songs, Kelly Groucutt sang lead vocals on \"Poker\" and (alternating with Lynne) on \"Nightrider\", giving the tracks a dynamic sound. The backing orchestra was recorded separately from the band's initial sessions, being recorded instead at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\nThe back cover of the record sleeve shows the members of the band with their faces pressed against a glass panel, supposedly watching the \"[[electric chair|electrocution]]\" depicted on the front cover. The band member who is looking away is [[Richard Tandy]], who didn't like the idea and didn't want to participate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bevan |first=Bev |editor-last=Pearce |editor-first=Garth |title=The Electric Light Orchestra Story |year=1980 |publisher=Mushroom Books |isbn=0-907394-01-9 |page=152 }}</ref> The back cover image was the inspiration for an advertising campaign for the [[2004 in film|2004]] [[horror comedy film]] ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/30930515@N07/18174675198/|title=Shaun of the Dead - Face the Music|date=1 June 2015|publisher=|via=Flickr}}</ref>\n\nThe new lineup introduced for this album became a stabilized and iconic one for the band's next 5 years and has been called by ELO fans the \"classic line-up\".\n\n== Songs ==\n\n=== Side One ===\n\n==== \"Fire on High\" ====\n{{Main|Fire On High}}\n\"Fire on High\" is the opening track of the album.\n\nIt begins with a haunting synthesizer (provided by Richard Tandy) playing a repeating broken chord of E\u266d, A, C, A along with a backing choir. The backing orchestration is minimal, featuring small bits here and there during which a \"knocking\" sound suddenly appears and fades out before a baritone voice fades in speaking a back-masked message. Drummer, [[Bev Bevan]] provided the voice and when the record is played backwards, he exclaims \"The music is reversible but time is not. Turn back, turn back, turn back, turn back\". This inclusion was a joke by Jeff Lynne, who faced mild controversy from a Christian fundamentalist group, accusing him of including backwards Satanic messages on the track \"Eldorado\" from their previous album of the same name.<ref>''[[Big Secrets]]'': Chapter 26, pages 200, 203, 204, 205 & 206. 0-688-04830-7</ref> The orchestration grows as a choir chants \"Hallelujah\" similar to the fashion of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] \"[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]\". The haunting opening concludes with the backing orchestra repeating the same broken chord as the synthesizer before transitioning into a more symphonic-rock bridge accompanied by the drums. The synthesizer plays an arpeggio during which the strings play riffs. Following this, Lynne provides a guitar-solo and the strings follow after. The song suddenly shifts to a rock sound with a prominent acoustic guitar riff where Kelly Groucutt joins on the bass guitar. Kaminski, McDowell and Gale all solo together on this rock-section. The rock section is followed by another symphonic-rock bridge with another guitar solo which, again, leads into a rock section. The choir at the end of the track chants \"Fire on high\" several times, providing the song the only set of true lyrics.\n\nJeff Lynne later remarked the entire concept of the song started with the idea of classical symphonic sound would collide with a rock and roll sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=FireOnHigh197529_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n\"Fire on High\" was released as the b-side to the U.S.'s \"[[Sweet Talkin' Woman]]\" single and the U.K.'s \"[[Livin' Thing]]\" single.\n\n==== \"Waterfall\" ====\n\"Waterfall\" is the second track on the album and the shortest track on side one.\n\nOpening with an orchestra intro and guitar solo, \"Waterfall\" is a slower and softer song in contrast to its predecessor. Lynne sings the lead vocals while Groucutt sings harmony vocals on the chorus. Kaminski, McDowell and Gale all play together mixed with the backing orchestra in the song's entirety, adding an extra layer of orchestration.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=Waterfall197533_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> The guitar and orchestral outro fade into the orchestra opening to \"Evil Woman\". The song is written in [[D major|D Major]].\n\nThe song was not released as a single anywhere with the exception of France and Australia where it became a minor hit.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJeff Lynne has gone on record saying that \"Waterfall\" is one of his favorite songs in the ELO catalogue.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe full instrumental (save for the guitar and string fade in) of this song was released as a bonus track for the 2006 ''Face the Music'' reissue. It includes a small section of in-studio banter and Lynne doing a count-in and also includes a slightly extended studio ending.\n\n==== \"Evil Woman\" ====\n{{main|Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|l1=Evil Woman}}\n\"Evil Woman\" is the third track on the album.\n\nThe song was written by Lynne in a matter of just a few minutes near the end of the Face the Music studio sessions in June 1975.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=EvilWoman197536_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Originally supposed to be a filler track to give the album a longer runtime, it quickly became a worldwide hit and was released as a single only a month after the album's release. The main song features a more disco-like rhythm (aside from the short orchestral interlude on the album version) with Tandy's piano riff and Lynne's acoustic guitar playing the chords Am, Em7 and Dm7. The female backing vocalists sang on the track during the \"ha ha\" pieces, the \"hey hey hey\" in the middle section of the song and the chorus, alongside with Lynne and Groucutt. The chorus featured an iconic riff of the clavinet (played by Tandy). The second verse includes the ELO string players playing the string rhythm section behind Lynne's vocals. The lyrics \"There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in\" is a reference to [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\". The final chord of the opening section (You made a fool of me) is actually mixed into \"Fire on High\" during the back-masked message.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/evilwoman/|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Electric Light Orchestra - Evil Woman song analysis|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe middle section features a piano solo by Tandy and a string ascending melody together before cutting an unusual string break. This break is actually a reversed cut of a string crescendo from the next track \"Nightrider\" put onto the track merely because, as Lynne described it, \"[the two songs] were in the same [[Musical key|key]].\" Lynne later remarked how amazed he was on how well the transition fit into place.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAn additional verse was written for the song but was cut from the final mix as proven in the stripped mix of the song which is found as a bonus track on the reissue of the album.\n\n==== \"Nightrider\" ====\n{{Main|Nightrider (song)|l1=Nightrider}}\n\"Nightrider\" is the fourth and final song on side one of the album. It was released as a single but did not chart unlike the other two album singles.\n\nThe track is unique for featuring both Lynne and Groucutt (though alternating) singing the lead vocals. It starts with a moog chord progression and string backing. The first verse has the ELO string trio playing the solo bits. The drums, guitar and bass all join on the pre-chorus (\"Hold on, nightrider\") along with backing harmonies from Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond. Just before each chorus, there is a small orchestral and choir break, the third of which is extended and includes a string crescendo which was later reversed and used on \"Evil Woman\".  Raymond later revealed on an ELO [[Facebook]] fan page that Lynne instructed the backing vocalists to emulate the sounds of the strings on the final verse for a specific sound, saying:<blockquote>\"On the part where he sings 'desolation degradation row, etc.' listen in the background... You hear string, but its also our voices emulating the string parts... I thought that was simply genius on Jeff Lynne's part to come up with that. Vocals that emulate string parts.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=Nightrider197545_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> \u2014 Marge Raymond</blockquote>\n\n=== Side Two ===\n\n==== \"Poker\" ====\n\"Poker\" is the opening track to (and shortest track on) side two of the album and the fifth track overall.\n\nThe song is a fast-tempo guitar-rocker featuring Kelly Groucutt on both lead and harmony vocals, one of few times where Jeff Lynne does not sing the lead. Bev Bevan plays fast, bombastic drum fills in between verses and Richard Tandy provides a moog synthesizer arpeggio rhythm section. The middle section of the song slows down into a slow, bluesy bridge (\"Play me another hand\") with Tandy adding in some synthesizer fillers. Lynne's harmony vocals come in on the final verse of the song.\n\n\"Poker\" was released as a b-side to the U.S.'s \"[[Confusion (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Confusion]]\" single and U.K.'s \"[[Rockaria!]]\" single.\n\n==== \"Strange Magic\" ====\n{{Main|Strange Magic}}\n\"Strange Magic\" is the sixth track on the album and second on side two. It was the second single lifted from ''Face the Music'', being released in February 1976, though was not as successful as \"Evil Woman\".\n\nThe track opens with a 21-second orchestra intro before cutting to a guitar lick with a soft piano. The choruses feature Lynne solely singing \"Strange magic\" three times, before jumping an [[octave]] higher singing \"Got a strange magic\" along with Groucutt, Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond on harmony vocals. Each chorus features more instrumentation than the previous: the first being just a guitar with a phaser effect, piano and mild percussion, the second having drums and an ascending string orchestration added and the third having more layers of strings. The bridge following the third chorus features some of the female singers singing \"It's magic, it's magic, it's magic\" and the final choruses include an additional different \"Strange magic\" melody done by the women. The album version fades into a back-masked reprise of the chorus of \"Waterfall\", ultimately leading into the next track \"Down Home Town\".\n\nAn oddity of the song is the fact that the guitar solo is played by Tandy rather than Lynne, the latter recalled:<blockquote>\"I just couldn't work it out. It was such a long run with two fingers.\" \u2014 Jeff Lynne, interview with Uncle Joe Benson</blockquote>Lynne also admitted in the [[Flashback (Electric Light Orchestra album)|''Flashback'']] liner notes that he wrote the song on various pianos in separate places while on tour in England with the band, presumably during the ''Eldorado'' tour.\n\nThough drums are a feature used in the studio recording of the song, drummer Bev Bevan would leave his drum set and join Lynne and Groucutt on the front of the stage, playing tambourine and singing the baritone parts of the song during live performances.\n\n==== \"Down Home Town\" ====\n\"Down Home Town\" is the seventh track on the album and the third on side two.\n\nThe song opens with a backmasked reprise of chorus of the track \"Waterfall\" but contrasts into an American folk-rock based sound. The ELO string trio has a greater influence on sound of this track, playing independently from the backing orchestra in a more [[fiddle]]-like fashion. Lynne sings the lead with a nasally, \"Nashville hoedown\" style.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Electric Light Orchestra Song by Song|last=Van Der Kiste|first=John|publisher=Fonthill|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78155-600-9|location=Stroud|pages=39}}</ref> While the four female singers usually sang in unison, this track features four part harmonies during the \"Look away\" section and, according to Raymond, the four were also allowed to add small bits with Lynne's approval such as Raymond's line \"Ooh, I feel you comin' down now.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=DownHomeTown197552_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> The song makes direct references to the \"[[Dixie|Land of Dixie]]\". During the final verse, there is a lyrical reference to The Beatles' song \"[[She Loves You]]\" in \"She loves you, no, no, no. Down home town.\" \n\n\"Down Home Town\" was released as the b-side to U.S. \"[[Last Train to London]]\" single and the U.K.'s \"[[The Diary of Horace Wimp]]\" single.\n\n==== \"One Summer Dream\" ====\n{{Main|One Summer Dream}}\n\"One Summer Dream\" is the eighth and final track on the album.\n\nThe song features an orchestral opening with Lynne singing with a soft tenor voice; the main verses and chorus feature Lynne on acoustic guitar with a phaser effect on it. Only Marge Raymond was featured on the track and sang the female chorus parts. The song includes a long fade of the lyrics \"One summer dream\", concluding the album.\n\nLynne's father, who had been vocally critical about Lynne's early albums admired the song and Lynne recalled that his father would hum the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=OneSummerDream197555_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThough a peaceful, easy-listening ballad, Lynne remarked on the Flashback notes that it was a \"protest\" song.\n\n\"One Summer Dream\" was released as the b-side to the \"[[Mr. Blue Sky]]\" single.\n\n==Release==\nThe singles \"[[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\" and \"[[Strange Magic]]\" were the most commercial songs they had recorded up to that point. \"Evil Woman\" was a big hit in the UK and the US, embracing disco rhythms while still embodying ELO's classic sound. Lynne wrote the chords and melody of this song in only six minutes, making it his fastest feat of composition.\n\n\"Nightrider\" became the third single from the album; despite an appearance on the UK chart television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', it failed to chart.\n\nNotwithstanding the success of the singles, the LP failed to chart in the UK. The album was remastered and released in September 2006 with bonus tracks.\n\n''Face the Music'' is generally seen by Lynne as the turning point for ELO as the success of the album and the singles \"Evil Woman\" and \"Strange Magic\" led to the band's popularity changed from minor popularity in America to major success (though it wouldn't be until their follow-up album ''[[A New World Record]]'' that launch them into global success).\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Jeff Lynne]], unless noted.\n\n{{Tracklist\n|headline = Side one\n|title1  = [[Fire On High]]\n|length1 = 5:30\n|title2  = Waterfall\n|length2 = 4:11\n|title3  = [[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\n|length3 = 4:35\n|title4  = [[Nightrider (song)|Nightrider]]\n|length4 = 4:26\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n|headline = Side two\n|title5  = Poker\n|length5 = 3:31\n|title6  = [[Strange Magic]]\n|length6 = 4:29\n|title7  = Down Home Town\n|length7 = 3:53\n|title8  = [[One Summer Dream]]\n|length8 = 5:47\n| total_length = 36:22\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline = 2006 remaster bonus tracks\n| title9 = Fire On High Intro\n| note9 = early alternate mix\n| length9 = 3:23\n| title10 = Evil Woman\n| note10 = stripped down mix\n| length10 = 5:00\n| title11 = Strange Magic\n| note11 = US single edit\n| length11 = 3:27\n| title12 = Waterfall\n| note12 = instrumental mix\n| length12 = 4:15\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Jeff Lynne]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[guitar]]s, [[Record producer|producer]]\n* [[Bev Bevan]] \u2013 [[drum kit|drums]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], spoken intro (backwards), [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]\n* [[Richard Tandy]] \u2013 [[piano]], [[clavinet]], [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], guitar, [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], [[tack piano]]\n* [[Kelly Groucutt]] \u2013 [[Singing|vocals]], [[bass guitar|bass]], backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Poker\", co-lead vocals on \"Nightrider\"\n* [[Mik Kaminski]] \u2013 [[violin]]\n* [[Hugh McDowell]] \u2013 [[cello]]\n* [[Melvyn Gale]] \u2013 cello\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n\n* [[Ellie Greenwich]] \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Susan Collins \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Nancy O'Neill \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Marge Raymond \u2013 uncredited vocals\n*[[Reinhold Mack|Mack]] \u2013 [[Audio engineer|engineer]]\n* Jeff Lynne, Richard Tandy and Louis Clark \u2013 [[Orchestra]]l and [[Choir|choral]] [[arrangement]]s\n* Orchestra conducted by [[Louis Clark]]\n* Although Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond are not credited as vocalists, the liner notes indicated 'special thanks' to them.\n\n==Chart positions==\n* US: number 13 ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|CashBox]]'';

It was released in September 1975 by [[United Artists Records]] and on 14 November 1975 in the United Kingdom by [[Jet Records]]. The album moves away from the large-scale classical orchestrated sound from the previous album, ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', in favor of more \"radio-friendly\" rock/pop songs, though the string sections are still very prominent. The new sound proved successful for the group as ''Face the Music'' was the first ELO album to go platinum.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftmusic.com/facethemusic/index.html|title=ELO Remaster Series - FACE THE MUSIC - INTRO|last=Greenwell|first=Ken|website=www.ftmusic.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nBy January 1975, [[Bass guitar|bass]] player [[Mike de Albuquerque]] and [[Cello|cellist]] [[Mike Edwards (musician)|Mike Edwards]] had left the band entirely during the ''Eldorado''<nowiki/>'s recording sessions and subsequent tour, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/eldoradotour/|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Electric Light Orchestra - Eldorado Tour|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Bass player [[Kelly Groucutt]] and classically-trained cellist [[Melvyn Gale]] both joined the band in full as their replacements. Following the conclusion of the Eldorado's European leg of the tour, the band began recording the new album at [[Musicland Studios]] in [[Munich|Munich, Germany]]. This was the first time ELO recorded at Musicland and the band would later return to record most of the future albums here due to [[Lead vocalist|frontman]] Jeff Lynne's great fondness for it and his working relationship with sound engineer [[Reinhold Mack|Mack]].\n\nLynne, also the band's sole songwriter, wanted to move towards more tunes that would be memorable rather than the usual prog-rock style of the group's first three albums and straight symphonic sound of the ''Eldorado''. New measures were taken to ensure a more-complex but satisfying sound, such as backing female vocalists of [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Collins, Nancy O'Neill and Marge Raymond, a choir, and the band's string trio of [[Mik Kaminski]], [[Hugh McDowell]] and Melvyn Gale mixed into the backing 30-piece string section and also allowing them to perform solo bits on some of the records.<ref name=\":0\" /> While Lynne was the lead vocalist for a vast majority of the band's songs, Kelly Groucutt sang lead vocals on \"Poker\" and (alternating with Lynne) on \"Nightrider\", giving the tracks a dynamic sound. The backing orchestra was recorded separately from the band's initial sessions, being recorded instead at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\nThe back cover of the record sleeve shows the members of the band with their faces pressed against a glass panel, supposedly watching the \"[[electric chair|electrocution]]\" depicted on the front cover. The band member who is looking away is [[Richard Tandy]], who didn't like the idea and didn't want to participate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bevan |first=Bev |editor-last=Pearce |editor-first=Garth |title=The Electric Light Orchestra Story |year=1980 |publisher=Mushroom Books |isbn=0-907394-01-9 |page=152 }}</ref> The back cover image was the inspiration for an advertising campaign for the [[2004 in film|2004]] [[horror comedy film]] ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/30930515@N07/18174675198/|title=Shaun of the Dead - Face the Music|date=1 June 2015|publisher=|via=Flickr}}</ref>\n\nThe new lineup introduced for this album became a stabilized and iconic one for the band's next 5 years and has been called by ELO fans the \"classic line-up\".\n\n== Songs ==\n\n=== Side One ===\n\n==== \"Fire on High\" ====\n{{Main|Fire On High}}\n\"Fire on High\" is the opening track of the album.\n\nIt begins with a haunting synthesizer (provided by Richard Tandy) playing a repeating broken chord of E\u266d, A, C, A along with a backing choir. The backing orchestration is minimal, featuring small bits here and there during which a \"knocking\" sound suddenly appears and fades out before a baritone voice fades in speaking a back-masked message. Drummer, [[Bev Bevan]] provided the voice and when the record is played backwards, he exclaims \"The music is reversible but time is not. Turn back, turn back, turn back, turn back\". This inclusion was a joke by Jeff Lynne, who faced mild controversy from a Christian fundamentalist group, accusing him of including backwards Satanic messages on the track \"Eldorado\" from their previous album of the same name.<ref>''[[Big Secrets]]'': Chapter 26, pages 200, 203, 204, 205 & 206. 0-688-04830-7</ref> The orchestration grows as a choir chants \"Hallelujah\" similar to the fashion of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] \"[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]\". The haunting opening concludes with the backing orchestra repeating the same broken chord as the synthesizer before transitioning into a more symphonic-rock bridge accompanied by the drums. The synthesizer plays an arpeggio during which the strings play riffs. Following this, Lynne provides a guitar-solo and the strings follow after. The song suddenly shifts to a rock sound with a prominent acoustic guitar riff where Kelly Groucutt joins on the bass guitar. Kaminski, McDowell and Gale all solo together on this rock-section. The rock section is followed by another symphonic-rock bridge with another guitar solo which, again, leads into a rock section. The choir at the end of the track chants \"Fire on high\" several times, providing the song the only set of true lyrics.\n\nJeff Lynne later remarked the entire concept of the song started with the idea of classical symphonic sound would collide with a rock and roll sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=FireOnHigh197529_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n\"Fire on High\" was released as the b-side to the U.S.'s \"[[Sweet Talkin' Woman]]\" single and the U.K.'s \"[[Livin' Thing]]\" single.\n\n==== \"Waterfall\" ====\n\"Waterfall\" is the second track on the album and the shortest track on side one.\n\nOpening with an orchestra intro and guitar solo, \"Waterfall\" is a slower and softer song in contrast to its predecessor. Lynne sings the lead vocals while Groucutt sings harmony vocals on the chorus. Kaminski, McDowell and Gale all play together mixed with the backing orchestra in the song's entirety, adding an extra layer of orchestration.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=Waterfall197533_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> The guitar and orchestral outro fade into the orchestra opening to \"Evil Woman\". The song is written in [[D major|D Major]].\n\nThe song was not released as a single anywhere with the exception of France and Australia where it became a minor hit.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJeff Lynne has gone on record saying that \"Waterfall\" is one of his favorite songs in the ELO catalogue.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe full instrumental (save for the guitar and string fade in) of this song was released as a bonus track for the 2006 ''Face the Music'' reissue. It includes a small section of in-studio banter and Lynne doing a count-in and also includes a slightly extended studio ending.\n\n==== \"Evil Woman\" ====\n{{main|Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|l1=Evil Woman}}\n\"Evil Woman\" is the third track on the album.\n\nThe song was written by Lynne in a matter of just a few minutes near the end of the Face the Music studio sessions in June 1975.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=EvilWoman197536_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Originally supposed to be a filler track to give the album a longer runtime, it quickly became a worldwide hit and was released as a single only a month after the album's release. The main song features a more disco-like rhythm (aside from the short orchestral interlude on the album version) with Tandy's piano riff and Lynne's acoustic guitar playing the chords Am, Em7 and Dm7. The female backing vocalists sang on the track during the \"ha ha\" pieces, the \"hey hey hey\" in the middle section of the song and the chorus, alongside with Lynne and Groucutt. The chorus featured an iconic riff of the clavinet (played by Tandy). The second verse includes the ELO string players playing the string rhythm section behind Lynne's vocals. The lyrics \"There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in\" is a reference to [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\". The final chord of the opening section (You made a fool of me) is actually mixed into \"Fire on High\" during the back-masked message.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/evilwoman/|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Electric Light Orchestra - Evil Woman song analysis|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe middle section features a piano solo by Tandy and a string ascending melody together before cutting an unusual string break. This break is actually a reversed cut of a string crescendo from the next track \"Nightrider\" put onto the track merely because, as Lynne described it, \"[the two songs] were in the same [[Musical key|key]].\" Lynne later remarked how amazed he was on how well the transition fit into place.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAn additional verse was written for the song but was cut from the final mix as proven in the stripped mix of the song which is found as a bonus track on the reissue of the album.\n\n==== \"Nightrider\" ====\n{{Main|Nightrider (song)|l1=Nightrider}}\n\"Nightrider\" is the fourth and final song on side one of the album. It was released as a single but did not chart unlike the other two album singles.\n\nThe track is unique for featuring both Lynne and Groucutt (though alternating) singing the lead vocals. It starts with a moog chord progression and string backing. The first verse has the ELO string trio playing the solo bits. The drums, guitar and bass all join on the pre-chorus (\"Hold on, nightrider\") along with backing harmonies from Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond. Just before each chorus, there is a small orchestral and choir break, the third of which is extended and includes a string crescendo which was later reversed and used on \"Evil Woman\".  Raymond later revealed on an ELO [[Facebook]] fan page that Lynne instructed the backing vocalists to emulate the sounds of the strings on the final verse for a specific sound, saying:<blockquote>\"On the part where he sings 'desolation degradation row, etc.' listen in the background... You hear string, but its also our voices emulating the string parts... I thought that was simply genius on Jeff Lynne's part to come up with that. Vocals that emulate string parts.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=Nightrider197545_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> \u2014 Marge Raymond</blockquote>\n\n=== Side Two ===\n\n==== \"Poker\" ====\n\"Poker\" is the opening track to (and shortest track on) side two of the album and the fifth track overall.\n\nThe song is a fast-tempo guitar-rocker featuring Kelly Groucutt on both lead and harmony vocals, one of few times where Jeff Lynne does not sing the lead. Bev Bevan plays fast, bombastic drum fills in between verses and Richard Tandy provides a moog synthesizer arpeggio rhythm section. The middle section of the song slows down into a slow, bluesy bridge (\"Play me another hand\") with Tandy adding in some synthesizer fillers. Lynne's harmony vocals come in on the final verse of the song.\n\n\"Poker\" was released as a b-side to the U.S.'s \"[[Confusion (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Confusion]]\" single and U.K.'s \"[[Rockaria!]]\" single.\n\n==== \"Strange Magic\" ====\n{{Main|Strange Magic}}\n\"Strange Magic\" is the sixth track on the album and second on side two. It was the second single lifted from ''Face the Music'', being released in February 1976, though was not as successful as \"Evil Woman\".\n\nThe track opens with a 21-second orchestra intro before cutting to a guitar lick with a soft piano. The choruses feature Lynne solely singing \"Strange magic\" three times, before jumping an [[octave]] higher singing \"Got a strange magic\" along with Groucutt, Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond on harmony vocals. Each chorus features more instrumentation than the previous: the first being just a guitar with a phaser effect, piano and mild percussion, the second having drums and an ascending string orchestration added and the third having more layers of strings. The bridge following the third chorus features some of the female singers singing \"It's magic, it's magic, it's magic\" and the final choruses include an additional different \"Strange magic\" melody done by the women. The album version fades into a back-masked reprise of the chorus of \"Waterfall\", ultimately leading into the next track \"Down Home Town\".\n\nAn oddity of the song is the fact that the guitar solo is played by Tandy rather than Lynne, the latter recalled:<blockquote>\"I just couldn't work it out. It was such a long run with two fingers.\" \u2014 Jeff Lynne, interview with Uncle Joe Benson</blockquote>Lynne also admitted in the [[Flashback (Electric Light Orchestra album)|''Flashback'']] liner notes that he wrote the song on various pianos in separate places while on tour in England with the band, presumably during the ''Eldorado'' tour.\n\nThough drums are a feature used in the studio recording of the song, drummer Bev Bevan would leave his drum set and join Lynne and Groucutt on the front of the stage, playing tambourine and singing the baritone parts of the song during live performances.\n\n==== \"Down Home Town\" ====\n\"Down Home Town\" is the seventh track on the album and the third on side two.\n\nThe song opens with a backmasked reprise of chorus of the track \"Waterfall\" but contrasts into an American folk-rock based sound. The ELO string trio has a greater influence on sound of this track, playing independently from the backing orchestra in a more [[fiddle]]-like fashion. Lynne sings the lead with a nasally, \"Nashville hoedown\" style<ref>{{Cite book|title=Electric Light Orchestra Song by Song|last=Van Der Kiste|first=John|publisher=Fonthill|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78155-600-9|location=Stroud|pages=39}}</ref>. While the four female singers usually sang in unison, this track features four part harmonies during the \"Look away\" section and, according to Raymond, the four were also allowed to add small bits with Lynne's approval such as Raymond's line \"Ooh, I feel you comin' down now.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=DownHomeTown197552_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref> The song makes direct references to the \"[[Dixie|Land of Dixie]]\". During the final verse, there is a lyrical reference to The Beatles' song \"[[She Loves You]]\" in \"She loves you, no, no, no. Down home town.\" \n\n\"Down Home Town\" was released as the b-side to U.S. \"[[Last Train to London]]\" single and the U.K.'s \"[[The Diary of Horace Wimp]]\" single.\n\n==== \"One Summer Dream\" ====\n{{Main|One Summer Dream}}\n\"One Summer Dream\" is the eighth and final track on the album.\n\nThe song features an orchestral opening with Lynne singing with a soft tenor voice; the main verses and chorus feature Lynne on acoustic guitar with a phaser effect on it. Only Marge Raymond was featured on the track and sang the female chorus parts. The song includes a long fade of the lyrics \"One summer dream\", concluding the album.\n\nLynne's father, who had been vocally critical about Lynne's early albums admired the song and Lynne recalled that his father would hum the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/popup.php?data=OneSummerDream197555_popupplus|title=Jeff Lynne Song Database - Song Details|website=www.jefflynnesongs.com|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThough a peaceful, easy-listening ballad, Lynne remarked on the Flashback notes that it was a \"protest\" song.\n\n\"One Summer Dream\" was released as the b-side to the \"[[Mr. Blue Sky]]\" single.\n\n==Release==\nThe singles \"[[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\" and \"[[Strange Magic]]\" were the most commercial songs they had recorded up to that point. \"Evil Woman\" was a big hit in the UK and the US, embracing disco rhythms while still embodying ELO's classic sound. Lynne wrote the chords and melody of this song in only six minutes, making it his fastest feat of composition.\n\n\"Nightrider\" became the third single from the album; despite an appearance on the UK chart television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', it failed to chart.\n\nNotwithstanding the success of the singles, the LP failed to chart in the UK. The album was remastered and released in September 2006 with bonus tracks.\n\n''Face the Music'' is generally seen by Lynne as the turning point for ELO as the success of the album and the singles \"Evil Woman\" and \"Strange Magic\" led to the band's popularity changed from minor popularity in America to major success (though it wouldn't be until their follow-up album ''[[A New World Record]]'' that launch them into global success).\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Jeff Lynne]], unless noted.\n\n{{Tracklist\n|headline = Side one\n|title1  = [[Fire On High]]\n|length1 = 5:30\n|title2  = Waterfall\n|length2 = 4:11\n|title3  = [[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\n|length3 = 4:35\n|title4  = [[Nightrider (song)|Nightrider]]\n|length4 = 4:26\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n|headline = Side two\n|title5  = Poker\n|length5 = 3:31\n|title6  = [[Strange Magic]]\n|length6 = 4:29\n|title7  = Down Home Town\n|length7 = 3:53\n|title8  = [[One Summer Dream]]\n|length8 = 5:47\n| total_length = 36:22\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline = 2006 remaster bonus tracks\n| title9 = Fire On High Intro\n| note9 = early alternate mix\n| length9 = 3:23\n| title10 = Evil Woman\n| note10 = stripped down mix\n| length10 = 5:00\n| title11 = Strange Magic\n| note11 = US single edit\n| length11 = 3:27\n| title12 = Waterfall\n| note12 = instrumental mix\n| length12 = 4:15\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Jeff Lynne]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[guitar]]s, [[Record producer|producer]]\n* [[Bev Bevan]] \u2013 [[drum kit|drums]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], spoken intro (backwards), [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]\n* [[Richard Tandy]] \u2013 [[piano]], [[clavinet]], [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], guitar, [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], [[tack piano]]\n* [[Kelly Groucutt]] \u2013 [[Singing|vocals]], [[bass guitar|bass]], backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Poker\", co-lead vocals on \"Nightrider\"\n* [[Mik Kaminski]] \u2013 [[violin]]\n* [[Hugh McDowell]] \u2013 [[cello]]\n* [[Melvyn Gale]] \u2013 cello\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n\n* [[Ellie Greenwich]] \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Susan Collins \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Nancy O'Neill \u2013 uncredited vocals\n* Marge Raymond \u2013 uncredited vocals\n*[[Reinhold Mack|Mack]] \u2013 [[Audio engineer|engineer]]\n* Jeff Lynne, Richard Tandy and Louis Clark \u2013 [[Orchestra]]l and [[Choir|choral]] [[arrangement]]s\n* Orchestra conducted by [[Louis Clark]]\n* Although Greenwich, Collins, O'Neill and Raymond are not credited as vocalists, the liner notes indicated 'special thanks' to them.\n\n==Chart positions==\n* US: number 13 ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|CashBox]]''; number 8 [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]];<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/electric-light-orchestra-mn0000163229/awards |title=Electric Light Orchestra - Awards |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]]: number 11 (1976); [[RIAA]] certification: Gold\n* UK: did not chart on its own when first released, but reached number 38 in 1978 as part of the 3-LP box-set ''[[Three Light Years]]''.\n* ITA: number 24 [[FIMI Albums Chart]]\n* AUS: number 30 [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]]\n* CAN: number 31 [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Albums Chart]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ftmusic.com/facethemusic/index.html Face the Music Remastered info] at ftmusic\n\n{{Electric Light Orchestra}}\n\n[[Category:Electric Light Orchestra albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Jeff Lynne]]\n[[Category:1975 albums]]\n[[Category:Epic Records albums]]\n[[Category:United Artists Records albums]]\n[[Category:Jet Records albums]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Music_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_album)"}
