Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]].

The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.\n\nA Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-punic-wars/ Appian, The Punic Wars]. livius.org</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tunisia/history|title=History of Tunisia \u2013 Lonely Planet Travel Information|website=lonelyplanet.com|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.\n\n[[File:Archaeological Site of Carthage-130238.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Carthage]]]]\n\nDuring the Roman period, the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.\n\nBy the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.\n[[File:Amphitheatre El Jem(js)1.jpg|thumb|The Roman amphitheater in [[El Djem]], built during the first half of the 3rd century AD]]\n\nThere was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to Italy, in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire).\n\nBerber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169009/Donatist | title = Donatist | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli.

It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long.

[[Phoenicia]]n immigration began in the 12th century BC; these immigrants founded [[Carthage]]. A major mercantile power and a military rival of the [[Roman Republic]], Carthage was [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|defeated]] by the Romans in 146 BC. The Romans occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introduced [[Christianity]] and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater. After several attempts starting in 647, [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslims conquered]] the whole of Tunisia by 697 and introduced [[Islam]]. After a series of campaigns beginning in 1534 to conquer and colonize the region, the [[Ottoman Empire]] established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years afterwards.

Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.\n\nBy the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.

It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30\u00b0]] and [[38th parallel north|38\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east.\n\nThough it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.\n\nThe [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].\n\nTunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|1|lk=in}}, and a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|1}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ewan W.|first=Anderson|title=International Boundaries: Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&pg=PA816|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=816}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nTunisia's climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |title=Climate of Tunisia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The south of the country is desert.

Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Elias Levy|Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name=\"tangka3\">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state.

Jung's work was influential in the fields of [[psychiatry]], anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] hospital, under [[Eugen Bleuler]]. During this time, he came to the attention of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]]. The two men conducted a [[The Freud/Jung Letters|lengthy correspondence]] and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [[synchronicity]], [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal phenomena]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]], and [[extraversion and introversion]].\n\nJung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\n====Childhood====\n[[File:Pfarrhaus Kleinh\u00fcningen.jpg|thumb|The clergy house in Kleinh\u00fcningen, Basel where Jung grew up]]\nCarl Gustav Jung{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As a university student Jung changed the modernized spelling of Karl to the original family form of Carl. {{cite book|last=Bair|first=Deirdre|authorlink=Deirdre Bair|title=Jung: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-15938-8|pages=7, 53}}}} was born in [[Kesswil]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Thurgau]], on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842\u20131896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848\u20131923).

As a boy, he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case.

He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]].

There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family members were clergymen as well. For a time, Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach archaeology. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided instead to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> His interest was immediately captured\u2014it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<ref name=\"jungbio1\">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung].

For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'', which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured\u2014each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. In 1900, Jung completed his degree, and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist, [[Eugen Bleuler]] at Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital.<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. (1987). ''Jung \u2013 A Biography''. Boston/Shaftesbury: Shambhala. {{ISBN|0 87773 455 0}}. p.&nbsp;77</ref> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899). In the early 1900s [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"psycho-analysis.\" At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burgh\u00f6lzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', and later sent a copy of this book to Freud\u2014who had already bought a copy.<ref name=diagnostic/> Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time, in Vienna on 3 March 1907.<ref>Wehr, p. 105-6.</ref> In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded ''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research.''\n\nIn 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] to the United States; they took part in a conference at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. The conference at [[Clark University]] was planned by the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists.

Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the [[Fordham University]] lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', (subsequently republished as ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''). While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a \"psychoanalytical Jung\" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades.

This rejection caused what Jung described in his (posthumous) 1962 autobiography, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', as a \"resounding censure\". Everyone he knew dropped away except for two of his colleagues.

He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, \"[[active imagination]]s\". He recorded everything he felt in small journals.

In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G.

William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref> Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.\n\nThe ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the \"collective psyche\", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the \"persona-mask\" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is \"a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be\".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]\", The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious\", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their \"own self\" \u2013 by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.\n\nJung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate \"management persona\" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, \"How to Look and Act Like a Leader\", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], \"May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement \u2013 Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism\".

The shadow is the result of an individual's attempt to adapt to cultural norms and expectations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society, but also those  that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.\n\nJung argues that the ''shadow'' plays an important role in balancing one's overall psyche - \"where there is light, there must also be shadow\u201d. Without a well-developed ''shadow'', an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others - i.e., a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].<ref name=\":0\" /> Not wanting to look at their shadow's directly, Jung argues, causes many individuals to project them onto others. Basically, the qualities an individual may hate in another, are actually also present in that individual, who wishes not to see them.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.\n\n===Spirituality===\nJung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential.

After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.\n\nHazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].\n\nThe above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.

Jung's work was influential in the fields of [[psychiatry]], anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] hospital, under [[Eugen Bleuler]]. During this time, he came to the attention of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]]. The two men conducted a [[The Freud/Jung Letters|lengthy correspondence]] and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [[synchronicity]], [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal phenomena]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]], and [[extraversion and introversion]].\n\nJung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\n====Childhood====\n[[File:Pfarrhaus Kleinh\u00fcningen.jpg|thumb|The clergy house in Kleinh\u00fcningen, Basel where Jung grew up]]\nCarl Gustav Jung{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As a university student Jung changed the modernized spelling of Karl to the original family form of Carl. {{cite book|last=Bair|first=Deirdre|authorlink=Deirdre Bair|title=Jung: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-15938-8|pages=7, 53}}}} was born in [[Kesswil]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Thurgau]], on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842\u20131896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848\u20131923).

Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished [[Basel]] churchman and academic, {{Interlanguage link multi|Samuel Preiswerk|de}} (1799\u20131871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was ''[[antistes]]'', the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a [[Hebraist]], author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at [[Basel University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17 17\u201319]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [[Laufen-Uhwiesen|Laufen]], but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night.<ref name=\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\">{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=18}}</ref> Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.<ref name=\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\"/>\n\nJung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near [[Basel]] for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with \"innate unreliability\", whereas \"father\" meant for him reliability but also powerlessness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|page=5|last=Dunne|first=Claire|publisher=Continuum|year=2002}}</ref> In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the \"handicap I started off with.

Although Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.<ref>Wehr records that Paul Jung's chosen career path was to achieve a doctorate in philology. He was an Arabist; but the family money ran out for his studies. Relief came from a family legacy, however, a condition of the will was that it should only be offered to a family member who intended to study theology and become a pastor. Paul Jung therefore had his career determined by a will, not his will. See page 20.</ref>\n\nA number of childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.<ref name=\"art-therapy\">{{cite book|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy A.|title=The Art Therapy Sourcebook|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vno0XgRuRhcC&pg=PA134|isbn=978-0-07-146827-5|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref> He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [[totem]]s in [[indigenous cultures]], such as the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]] or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22\u201323}}</ref> His observations about symbols, [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]] were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 144</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the [[:de:Gymnasium am M\u00fcnsterplatz|Humanistisches Gymnasium]] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him\u2014\"now you won't have to go to school anymore.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=30}}</ref> From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, \"was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=32}}</ref>\n\n====University studies and early career====\nInitially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister in his early life. There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family members were clergymen as well. For a time, Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach archaeology. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided instead to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> His interest was immediately captured\u2014it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<ref name=\"jungbio1\">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung].

They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 57.</ref> During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of [[Goethe]] and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1900, Jung moved to [[Z\u00fcrich]] and began working at the [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] psychiatric hospital under [[Eugen Bleuler]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|pp=234, 259}} Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]]. Jung's [[dissertation]], published in 1903, was titled ''On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena.'' In 1905 Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and also became a lecturer ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in the medical faculty of Zurich University.<ref>Wehr, pp. 79\u201385.</ref> In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', which Freud obtained a copy of.<ref name=diagnostic>{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=William|title=The Freud/Jung Letters|year=1979|publisher=Picador|pages=12\u201313|isbn=978-0330258913}}</ref> In 1909, Jung left the psychiatric hospital and began a private practice in his home in [[K\u00fcsnacht]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=259}}\n\nEventually a close friendship and a strong professional association developed between the elder [[#Relationship with Freud|Freud and Jung]], which left a sizeable [[Freud-Jung Letters|correspondence]]. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'', which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured\u2014each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. In 1900, Jung completed his degree, and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist, [[Eugen Bleuler]] at Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital.<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. (1987). ''Jung \u2013 A Biography''. Boston/Shaftesbury: Shambhala. {{ISBN|0 87773 455 0}}. p.&nbsp;77</ref> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899). In the early 1900s [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"psycho-analysis.\" At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burgh\u00f6lzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', and later sent a copy of this book to Freud\u2014who had already bought a copy.<ref name=diagnostic/> Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time, in Vienna on 3 March 1907.<ref>Wehr, p. 105-6.</ref> In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded ''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research.''\n\nIn 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] to the United States; they took part in a conference at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. The conference at [[Clark University]] was planned by the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America.

While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Heth|title=Psychology: The Science of Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434 434]|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434}}</ref> Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [[Ludwig Binswanger]] in [[Kreuzlingen]] without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as \"the Kreuzlingen gesture\". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the [[Fordham University]] lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', (subsequently republished as ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''). While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a \"psychoanalytical Jung\" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless it was their publication which, Jung declared, \"cost me my friendship with Freud\".<ref name=\"Gay 2006 225\">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Gay|title= Freud: A Life for Our Time|publisher=Norton| date =2006 | pages = 225|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.<ref>Mary Williams, \"The Indivisibility of the Personal and Collective Unconscious\", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 8.1, January 1963.

This constituted the introduction of some of the key concepts which came to distinguish Jung's work from Freud's in the next half century.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Midlife isolation====\nIt was the publication of Jung's book ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' in 1912 that led to the break with Freud. Letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his (posthumous) 1962 autobiography, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', as a \"resounding censure\". Everyone he knew dropped away except for two of his colleagues. Jung described his book as \"an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview.\" The book was later revised and retitled ''Symbols of Transformation'' in 1922.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=====London 1913\u201314=====\nJung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914.

He worried at times that he was \"menaced by a psychosis\" or was \"doing a schizophrenia\". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, \"[[active imagination]]s\". He recorded everything he felt in small journals.

Jung's interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to view him as a mystic, although his preference was to be seen as a man of science.<ref name=\"Lachmanpage258\">{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=Jung the Mystic|year=2010|publisher=Tarcher/Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58542-792-5|page=258}}</ref>\n\n===Key concepts===\nThe major concepts of [[analytical psychology]] as developed by Jung include:<ref>Anthony Stevens (1991) ''On Jung'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 27\u201353</ref>\n\n'''[[Jungian archetypes|Archetype]]''' \u2013  a concept \"borrowed\" from [[anthropology]] to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes.

In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G.

William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref> Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.\n\nThe ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the \"collective psyche\", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the \"persona-mask\" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is \"a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be\".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]\", The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious\", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their \"own self\" \u2013 by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.\n\nJung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate \"management persona\" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, \"How to Look and Act Like a Leader\", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], \"May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement \u2013 Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism\".

Vienna: Akademische Verlagsanstalt, 2009, pp. 192, 193, 194.</ref>\n\n=== Shadow ===\n''See also: [[shadow (psychology)]]''\n\nThe ''shadow'' exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals dislike/would rather ignore: repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. The shadow is the result of an individual's attempt to adapt to cultural norms and expectations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society, but also those  that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.\n\nJung argues that the ''shadow'' plays an important role in balancing one's overall psyche - \"where there is light, there must also be shadow\u201d. Without a well-developed ''shadow'', an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others - i.e., a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].<ref name=\":0\" /> Not wanting to look at their shadow's directly, Jung argues, causes many individuals to project them onto others. Basically, the qualities an individual may hate in another, are actually also present in that individual, who wishes not to see them.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.\n\n===Spirituality===\nJung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called [[individuation]], is at the mystical heart of all religions.

After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.\n\nHazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].\n\nThe above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984) ''Pass It On: The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A.A. Message Reached the World.'' New York: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. {{ISBN|0-916856-12-7}}, page. 381\u2013386.</ref> Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his ''Collected Works'', ''The Symbolic Life,''\n\n{{blockquote|For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group.

For decades he attended [[seance]]s and claimed to have witnessed \"parapsychic phenomena\". Initially he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on \"The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits\".<ref name=\"Jung1997\">{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=6|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref> However, he began to \"doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question\"<ref name=\"Jung1997\"/> and stated that \"the spirit hypothesis yields better results\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=7|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref>\n\nJung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in \"[[synchronicity]]\", his idea that meaningful connections in the world manifest through coincidence with no apparent causal link.

However, until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and there were allegations that he himself was a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nIn 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in restructuring of the [[International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy|General Medical Society for Psychotherapy]] (''Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie''), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:\n# A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie, led by [[Matthias G\u00f6ring]], an [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] psychotherapist<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/psychotherapy-in-the-third-reich.html Lifton, Robert Jay (27 January 1985) \"Psychotherapy in the Third Reich\"] ''The New York Times''</ref> and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\n# International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung.

He wrote that because of the speeches he delivered he was blacklisted by the Nazis.

Dulles referred to Jung as \"Agent 488\" and offered the following description of his service: \"Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side\".

Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [[dream interpretation|dream analysis]] and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the \"psychologization of religion\", [[spirituality]] and the [[New Age]] movement has been immense.
