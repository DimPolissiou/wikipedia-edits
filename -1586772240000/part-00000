{"title_page": "Indo-European sound laws", "text_new": "{{PIE notice}}\nAs the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE)  broke up, [[Proto-Indo-European phonology|its sound system]] diverged as well, as evidenced in various [[sound change|sound law]]s associated with the [[daughter language | daughter]] [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nEspecially notable is the palatalization that produced the [[satem language]]s, along with the associated [[ruki sound law]].  Other notable changes include:\n\n* [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]]\n* an independent change similar to Grimm's law in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]\n* loss of prevocalic ''*p-'' in [[Proto-Celtic]]\n* [[Brugmann's law]] in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]]\n* [[Winter's law]] and [[Hirt's law]] in [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]]\n* merging of voiced and breathy-voiced stops, and /a/ and /o/, in various \"northern\" languages\n\n[[Bartholomae's law]] in Indo-Iranian, and [[Sievers's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] and (to some extent) various other branches, may or may not have been common Indo-European features. A number of innovations, both [[phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], represent [[areal feature]]s common to the [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] languages; among them the development of [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]]s to [[labial consonants]] in some Italic and Celtic branches, producing \"[[p-Celtic]]\" and \"[[q-Celtic]]\" languages (likewise \"p-Italic\" and \"q-Italic\", although these terms are less used).  Another grouping with many shared [[areal feature|areal]] innovations comprises Greek, Indo-Iranian, and Armenian; among its common phonological innovations are [[Grassmann's law]] in Greek and Indo-Iranian, and weakening of pre-vocalic /s/ to /h/ in Greek, Iranian and Armenian.\n\n==Consonants==\nThe following table shows the Proto-Indo-European consonants  and their [[Reflex (linguistics)|reflexes]] in selected Indo-European daughter languages. Background and further details can be found in various related articles, including [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]], [[Centum and satem languages]], the articles on the various sound laws referred to in the introduction, and the articles on the various IE proto-languages, language groups and language phonologies.

Other notable changes include:\n\n* [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]]\n* an independent change similar to Grimm's law in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]\n* loss of prevocalic ''*p-'' in [[Proto-Celtic]]\n* [[Brugmann's law]] in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]]\n* [[Winter's law]] and [[Hirt's law]] in [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]]\n* merging of voiced and breathy-voiced stops, and /a/ and /o/, in various \"northern\" languages\n\n[[Bartholomae's law]] in Indo-Iranian, and [[Sievers' law]] in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] and (to some extent) various other branches, may or may not have been common Indo-European features.

Another grouping with many shared [[areal feature|areal]] innovations comprises Greek, Indo-Iranian, and Armenian; among its common phonological innovations are [[Grassmann's law]] in Greek and Indo-Iranian, and weakening of pre-vocalic /s/ to /h/ in Greek, Iranian and Armenian.\n\n==Consonants==\nThe following table shows the Proto-Indo-European consonants  and their [[Reflex (linguistics)|reflexes]] in selected Indo-European daughter languages.

But Henry V died in 1422 and his son was not yet one year old; the regency was entrusted to [[John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford]]. \nThe intervention of Joan of Arc with the Dauphin Charles would be seen as miraculous, even more so after the lifting of the Siege of Orleans and the Battle of Patay.\n\n[[File:Treaty of Troyes.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|'''1415\u20131429'''{{Legend|#ea8b9d|Territories controlled by [[Henry VI of England]]}}\n{{Legend|#c896c8|Territories controlled by [[Philip the Good|Philip III of Burgundy]]}}\n{{Legend|#7f9ad7|Territories controlled by [[Charles VII of France]]}}\n{{Legend|#ffff00|Main battles}}\n{{Legend-line|red dotted 2px|English raid of 1415}}\n{{Background color|silver|\n{{Legend-line|inline=yes|white dotted 2px|Joan's journey from Domr\u00e9my to [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]]}}}}\n{{Legend-line|blue dotted 2px|Raid of Jeanne d'Arc to [[Reims]] in 1429}}]]\n\n==March to Reims ==\nFor the first time in the history of France, the king did not let the crown pass to his eldest son. [[Charles VI of France]] disinherited his son, leaving the kingdom of France to Henry VI of England, who was the son of his daughter [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]]. After Charles VI died, his son challenged his disinheritance and claimed the throne. Despite the French victory in the Battle of Patay on June 18, which caused the decline of the English in Paris, the dauphin Charles VII refused to continue to Reims, which was in the hands of the Burgundians, remaining in [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and withdrew his army to [[Orleans]] to be crowned there as was [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]]; Nevertheless, a [[coronation]] in Reims would have a much greater impact because it would be seen as a new miracle, attesting to his divine legitimacy. After initially meeting the Dauphin on May 23, 1429 at the Royal City of Loches, Joan of Arc next met him again on June 21 at four o'clock in the [[Fleury Abbey]] to persuade him to go to Reims.\nThe next day, the dauphin's council met in [[Chateauneuf-sur-Loire]] and ordered the army to gather at [[Gien]].\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 63.jpg|thumb|Joan of Arc chasing of prostitutes]]\nOn June 24, preceded by her page, [[Louis de Coutes]], who held her banner emblazoned \"''Jhesus Maria'',\" Joan of Arc \u2014 arriving at Gien with her armor forged in [[Tours]], her armor and sword of Fierbois \u2014 found Charles VII. The next day, 12,000 men of the king's army gathered in Gien, increasing to 33,000 men fighting on horseback and 40,000 on foot. The French army took [[Bonny-sur-Loire]] and [[Saint-Fargeau]]. Joan of Arc broke her sword on the back of a prostitute who followed the army, and two days later the Dauphin finally ordered the march to the city of the [[coronation]]: the march began at Gien on June 29, 1429. The ease of the march showed both the fragility of the Anglo-Burgundian rule and the restoration of confidence in the cause of Charles VII of France. According to [[Jean de Dunois]]  the bluff was the only tactic that opened the gates of the city. The [[Marshal of France]], [[Gilles de Rais]], rode to Reims, hoping to use this victorious march to retrieve a ransom of land taken from \"collaborators.\" Joan of Arc was escorted from Gien by her captains: Tugdual Kermoysan, [[La Hire]], [[Andr\u00e9 de Laval-Montmorency|Andr\u00e9 of Loh\u00e9ac]], [[Pierre Rieux]], [[Jean V de Bueil]], [[Pierre Bessonneau]], [[Jacques de Chabannes]], [[Jacques Dinan]], and [[Jean Poton de Xaintrailles]]. On the road to Reims, the [[Constable]] de [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Richemont]] sent [[Pierre Rostrenen]] to ask leave of the dauphin to serve at his coronation. Rostrenen accompanied the constable to [[Parthenay]]. During the march, the Burgundian garrison located in [[Auxerre]] refused to open its gates. [[Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille]] was given two thousand gold \u00e9cus by the minister of the city, for the city to remain neutral and allow the French army to resupply itself and to camp outside its walls (on July 1 and 2). The army of the Dauphin left again; [[Saint-Florentin, Yonne|Saint-Florentin]] submitted immediately, as did  [[Brienon-sur-Arman\u00e7on|Brienon l\u2019Archev\u00eaque]] \u2014 on July 4, the army reached [[Troyes]], five to six percent of whose occupants were Burgundians, who refused to open the gates.\n\n[[File:Vigiles misc 03.jpg|thumb|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The citizens of Troyes hand over city keys to the Dauphin and Joan of Arc.]]\nAfter four days of siege, the majority of the dauphin's council wanted to lift the siege and continue on the road without entering the city. On the fifth day of the siege, July 9, Troyes capitulated (for fear of attack), but only Charles VII and the captains were able to enter. The soldiers spent the night in [[Saint-Phal]], under the command of [[Ambroise de Lor\u00e9]]. Gilles de Rais was one of the leaders of the army who reduced Troyes to obedience.\n\nFewer than 2000 English soldiers of the captain of [[Paris]], John of Lancaster occupied Paris, which had as its provost [[Simon Morhier]], and as Governor [[Jean de La Baume]]. Philip the Good of Burgundy opted to leave Laon for Paris, where he arrived on July 10, appointed the Master of the Louvre [[Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]] governor, and committed to him the safety of Paris in the absence of Lancaster. Philip sent ambassadors to the Dauphin Charles VII to sue for peace.\n\nOn July 11, the Dauphin's army left Troyes for the first time to head to [[Chalons-en-Champagne]], which opened its gates on July 14 to let him spend the night.\n\nOn Saturday, July 16, in the morning, Philip the Good left Paris to return to [[Laon]], while the Archbishop of Reims, [[Renault Chartres]], left Reims in the hands of William, Lord of Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Marne and of the Sire de Saveuses; the dauphin arrived at the castle of the Archbishop of Reims in [[Sept-Saulx]] (located 21&nbsp;km from Reims). The dauphin summoned the people of Reims to open their gates, despite their vow to resist him for six weeks until the arrival of relief by Lancaster and Philip the Good. After negotiations and dinner, Charles VII entered and slept in Reims. That same day, [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]] brought the homage of [[Lorraine]] and [[Barrois]] to the Dauphin.\n\n==Consequences ==\n\nOn Sunday, July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned  King of France in Reims: he received the [[Holy Ampulla]] from the hands of the Archbishop Renault Chartres. \"Noble King, now is executed the pleasure of God who wished I lift the siege of Orleans, and I bring you into this city of Rheims to receive your holy coronation to show you are the true king, and the one to whom the kingdom of France must belong,\" declared Joan of Arc, paying tribute to her king. The coronation ceremony, given the circumstances, took place in simplicity, because the crown, the scepter, and the globe, were still in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], which was controlled by the English; among the [[Peers of France|peers]], only three of the spiritual peers attended the ceremony: the [[Archbishop of Reims]] Renault Chartres, the [[Bishop of Laon]] William of Champeaux, the [[bishop of Chalons]] Jean Saarbr\u00fccken. But the essential rite was performed: the eighth sacrament ([[anointing]] of the king), which makes kings and which marks the sacred sign of legitimate power, was then given to Charles VII, making him the rightful monarch, representing the [[House of Valois]], authentically appointed by God, against John of Lancaster, whom enemy arms had imposed, and against the irresponsible signature of a [[Charles VI of France|mad king]].\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor the fifth centennial of the campaign, and in the context of the [[canonization of Joan of Arc]], a series of plaques was mounted on the route that  Joan followed to retake Reims and crown the king.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nChalons Jehanne d'Arc 8276.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]],\nMontmirail Mairie - Plaque Jeanne d'Arc.jpg|[[Montmirail (Marne)|Montmirail]],\nPlaque porte Saint Pierre (Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry).jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]],\nCormicy - plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|[[Cormicy]],\nCorbeny (Aisne) mairie, plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|[[Corbeny]],\nReims - plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|and [[Reims]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reims}}\n[[Category:1429 in Europe]]\n[[Category:1420s in France]]\n[[Category:Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Hundred Years' War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1429]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{cleanup|date=May 2016|reason=The text sounds like a machine translation}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2016}}\n}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=March to Reims\n|partof= the [[Hundred Years' War]]\n|image=Vigiles du roi Charles VII 43.jpg\n|caption=Coronation of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] in [[Reims]] (miniature from the ''Vigiles du roi Charles VII'' de [[Martial d'Auvergne]], Paris, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|BnF]], d\u00e9partement of Manuscrits).\n|date= June 24&ndash;16 July 1429\n|place= [[Gien]] to Reims, France \n|result=[[Coronation]] of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] in [[Reims]]\n|combatant1=[[File:Arms of France (France Moderne).svg|20px]] [[Kingdom of France]]\n|combatant2=[[File:Royal Arms of England (1470-1471).svg|20px]] [[Kingdom of England]] <br/>[[Image:Arms of the Duke of Burgundy (1404-1430).svg|20px]] [[Burgundian State]]\n|commander1=\n[[File:BlasonIledeFrance.svg|20px]] [[Charles VII of France]] <br/>\n[[File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Jeanne_d%27Arc.svg|20px]] [[Joan of Arc]] <br/>\n[[Image:Arms of Jean dAlencon.svg|20px]] [[Jean II, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Jean II d'Alen\u00e7on]] <br/>\n[[File:Arms of jean de dunois.svg|20px]] [[Jean de Dunois]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason Etienne de Vignolles (La Hire).svg|20px]] [[\u00c9tienne de Vignolles|La Hire]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason Jean Poton de Xaintrailles.svg|20px]] [[Jean Poton de Xaintrailles|Jean de Xaintrailles]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason Ambroise de Lor\u00e9.svg|20px]] [[Ambroise de Lor\u00e9]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason famille Brosse.svg|20px]] [[Jean de Brosse]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason Gilles de Rais.svg|20px]] [[Gilles de Rais]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason famille de Culant.jpeg|20px]] [[Louis de Culant]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason fam FRA la Tr\u00e9moille.svg|20px]] [[Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille]] <br/>\n[[File:Armoiries Albret moderne.png|20px]] [[Charles II of Albret]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason duche fr Bourbon (moderne).svg|20px]] [[Charles I, Duke of Bourbon|Charles de Bourbon]] <br/>\n[[Image:Armoiries Louis de Vend\u00f4me.svg|20px]] [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason Gui VII de Laval.svg|20px]] [[Guy XIV de Laval|Guy de Montfort-Laval]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason Andr\u00e9 de Loh\u00e9ac.svg|20px]] [[Andr\u00e9 de Loh\u00e9ac]] <br/>\n[[File:Blason Jean V de Bueil.svg|20px]] [[Jean V de Bueil]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason fam fr Motier de La Fayette.svg|20px]] [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]]<ref>d\u2019apr\u00e8s d\u2019autre source il semble ne pas avoir particip\u00e9 http://jean-claude.colrat.pagesperso-orange.fr/1lafayette.htm</ref> <br/>\n[[Image:Blason \u00e0 dessiner.svg|20px]] [[Pierre Bessonneau]]\n|commander2=[[Image:Royal Arms of England (1399-1603).svg|20px]] [[Henry VI of England]] <br/>\n[[Image:Arms of John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford.svg|20px]] [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason fr Bourgogne.svg|20px]] [[Philip the Good]] <br/>\n[[Image:Blason Thomas de Scales.svg|20px]] [[Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales|Thomas de Scales]] <br/>\n[[File:Beaufort_Arms_(France_modern).svg|20px]] [[John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|John Beaufort, 3rd Earl of Somerset]] <br/>\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir John Fastolf, KG.png|20px]] [[John Fastolf]]\n|strength1=12,000 to 77,000\n|strength2=\n|casualties1=\n|casualties2=\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Hundred Years' War}}\n{{Campaignbox Lancastrian War}}\nAfter the lifting of the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] and the decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Patay]], the Anglo-Burgundian threat was ended.

But Henry V died in 1422 and his son was not yet one year old; the regency was entrusted to [[John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford]]. \nThe intervention of Joan of Arc with the Dauphin Charles would be seen as miraculous, even more so after the lifting of the Siege of Orleans and the Battle of Patay.\n\n[[File:Treaty of Troyes.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|'''1415\u20131429'''{{Legend|#ea8b9d|Territories controlled by [[Henry VI of England]]}}\n{{Legend|#c896c8|Territories controlled by [[Philip the Good|Philip III of Burgundy]]}}\n{{Legend|#7f9ad7|Territories controlled by [[Charles VII of France]]}}\n{{Legend|#ffff00|Main battles}}\n{{Legend-line|red dotted 2px|English raid of 1415}}\n{{Background color|silver|\n{{Legend-line|inline=yes|white dotted 2px|Joan's journey from Domr\u00e9my to [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]]}}}}\n{{Legend-line|blue dotted 2px|Raid of Jeanne d'Arc to [[Reims]] in 1429}}]]\n\n==March to Reims ==\nFor the first time in the history of France, the king did not let the crown pass to his eldest son. [[Charles VI of France]] disinherited his son, leaving the kingdom of France to Henry VI of England, who was the son of his daughter [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]]. After Charles VI died, his son challenged his disinheritance and claimed the throne. Despite the French victory in the Battle of Patay on June 18, which caused the decline of the English in Paris, the dauphin Charles VII refused to continue to Reims, which was in the hands of the Burgundians, remaining in [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and withdrew his army to [[Orleans]] to be crowned there as was [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]]; Nevertheless, a [[coronation]] in Reims would have a much greater impact because it would be seen as a new miracle, attesting to his divine legitimacy. After initially meeting the Dauphin on May 23, 1429 at the Royal City of Loches, Joan of Arc next met him again on June 21 at four o'clock in the [[Fleury Abbey]] to persuade him to go to Reims.\nThe next day, the dauphin's council met in [[Chateauneuf-sur-Loire]] and ordered the army to gather at [[Gien]].\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 63.jpg|thumb|Joan of Arc chasing of prostitutes]]\nOn June 24, preceded by her page, [[Louis de Coutes]], who held her banner emblazoned \"''Jhesus Maria'',\" Joan of Arc \u2014 arriving at Gien with her armor forged in [[Tours]], her armor and sword of Fierbois \u2014 found Charles VII. The next day, 12,000 men of the king's army gathered in Gien, increasing to 33,000 men fighting on horseback and 40,000 on foot. The French army took [[Bonny-sur-Loire]] and [[Saint-Fargeau]]. Joan of Arc broke her sword on the back of a prostitute who followed the army, and two days later the Dauphin finally ordered the march to the city of the [[coronation]]: the march began at Gien on June 29, 1429. The ease of the march showed both the fragility of the Anglo-Burgundian rule and the restoration of confidence in the cause of Charles VII of France. According to [[Jean de Dunois]]  the bluff was the only tactic that opened the gates of the city. The [[Marshal of France]], [[Gilles de Rais]], rode to Reims, hoping to use this victorious march to retrieve a ransom of land taken from \"collaborators.\" Joan of Arc was escorted from Gien by her captains: Tugdual Kermoysan, [[La Hire]], [[Andr\u00e9 de Laval-Montmorency|Andr\u00e9 of Loh\u00e9ac]], [[Pierre Rieux]], [[Jean V de Bueil]], [[Pierre Bessonneau]], [[Jacques de Chabannes]], [[Jacques Dinan]], and [[Jean Poton de Xaintrailles]]. On the road to Reims, the [[Constable]] de [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Richemont]] sent [[Pierre Rostrenen]] to ask leave of the dauphin to serve at his coronation. Rostrenen accompanied the constable to [[Parthenay]]. During the march, the Burgundian garrison located in [[Auxerre]] refused to open its gates. [[Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille]] was given two thousand gold \u00e9cus by the minister of the city, for the city to remain neutral and allow the French army to resupply itself and to camp outside its walls (on July 1 and 2). The army of the Dauphin left again; [[Saint-Florentin, Yonne|Saint-Florentin]] submitted immediately, as did  [[Brienon-sur-Arman\u00e7on|Brienon l\u2019Archev\u00eaque]] \u2014 on July 4, the army reached [[Troyes]], five to six percent of whose occupants were Burgundians, who refused to open the gates.\n\n[[File:Vigiles misc 03.jpg|thumb|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The citizens of Troyes hand over city keys to the Dauphin and Joan of Arc.]]\nAfter four days of siege, the majority of the dauphin's council wanted to lift the siege and continue on the road without entering the city. On the fifth day of the siege, July 9, Troyes capitulated (for fear of attack), but only Charles VII and the captains were able to enter. The soldiers spent the night in [[Saint-Phal]], under the command of [[Ambroise de Lor\u00e9]]. Gilles de Rais was one of the leaders of the army who reduced Troyes to obedience.\n\nFewer than 2000 English soldiers of the captain of [[Paris]], John of Lancaster occupied Paris, which had as its provost [[Simon Morhier]], and as Governor [[Jean de La Baume]]. Philip the Good of Burgundy opted to leave Laon for Paris, where he arrived on July 10, appointed the Master of the Louvre [[Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]] governor, and committed to him the safety of Paris in the absence of Lancaster. Philip sent ambassadors to the Dauphin Charles VII to sue for peace.\n\nOn July 11, the Dauphin's army left Troyes for the first time to head to [[Chalons-en-Champagne]], which opened its gates on July 14 to let him spend the night.\n\nOn Saturday, July 16, in the morning, Philip the Good left Paris to return to [[Laon]], while the Archbishop of Reims, [[Renault Chartres]], left Reims in the hands of William, Lord of Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Marne and of the Sire de Saveuses; the dauphin arrived at the castle of the Archbishop of Reims in [[Sept-Saulx]] (located 21&nbsp;km from Reims). The dauphin summoned the people of Reims to open their gates, despite their vow to resist him for six weeks until the arrival of relief by Lancaster and Philip the Good. After negotiations and dinner, Charles VII entered and slept in Reims. That same day, [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]] brought the homage of [[Lorraine]] and [[Barrois]] to the Dauphin.\n\n==Consequences ==\n\nOn Sunday, July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned  King of France in Reims: he received the [[Holy Ampulla]] from the hands of the Archbishop Renault Chartres. \"Noble King, now is executed the pleasure of God who wished I lift the siege of Orleans, and I bring you into this city of Rheims to receive your holy coronation to show you are the true king, and the one to whom the kingdom of France must belong,\" declared Joan of Arc, paying tribute to her king. The coronation ceremony, given the circumstances, took place in simplicity, because the crown, the scepter, and the globe, were still in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], which was controlled by the English; among the [[Peers of France|peers]], only three of the spiritual peers attended the ceremony: the [[Archbishop of Reims]] Renault Chartres, the [[Bishop of Laon]] William of Champeaux, the [[bishop of Chalons]] Jean Saarbr\u00fccken. But the essential rite was performed: the eighth sacrament ([[anointing]] of the king), which makes kings and which marks the sacred sign of legitimate power, was then given to Charles VII, making him the rightful monarch, representing the [[House of Valois]], authentically appointed by God, against John of Lancaster, whom enemy arms had imposed, and against the irresponsible signature of a [[Charles VI of France|mad king]].\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor the fifth centennial of the campaign, and in the context of the [[canonization of Joan of Arc]], a series of plaques was mounted on the route that  Joan followed to retake Reims and crown the king.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nChalons Jehanne d'Arc 8276.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]],\nMairie 1162.jpg|[[Montmirail (Marne)|Montmirail]],\nPlaque porte Saint Pierre (Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry).jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]],\nCormicy - plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|[[Cormicy]],\nCorbeny (Aisne) mairie, plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|[[Corbeny]],\nReims - plaque Jeanne d'Arc.JPG|and [[Reims]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reims}}\n[[Category:1429 in Europe]]\n[[Category:1420s in France]]\n[[Category:Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Hundred Years' War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1429]]\n", "name_user": "XalD", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:Mairie 1162.jpg\u2192File:Montmirail Mairie - Plaque Jeanne d'Arc.jpgCriterion 2(meaningless or ambiguous name) \u00b7 Not precise enough", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_to_Reims"}

''{{transl|ar|DIN|ad-Damm\u0101m}}'') is the capital of the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The judicial and administrative bodies of the province, plus several government departments, are located in the city. Dammam is the largest city in the Eastern Province, and the sixth largest in Saudi Arabia, after [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Taif]].<ref name = \"ArabNews\">{{cite web |title=Riyadh most populous Saudi city, Makkah most populous province |url= http://www.arabnews.com/node/407209 |publisher=Arab News |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref> Like the other 12 [[Regions of Saudi Arabia|regional capitals of Saudi Arabia]], Dammam is not included within any [[List of governorates of Saudi Arabia|governorate]]; instead, it is governed as a \"municipality\" ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629}}; ''[[Amanah (administrative subdivision)|amanah]]'') headed by a [[mayor]] ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646}}; ''amin'').\n\nDammam is a major administrative center for the Saudi oil industry. Together with the nearby cities of [[Dhahran]] and [[Khobar|Al Khobar]], Dammam and its suburbs form the center of the [[Dammam metropolitan area]], also known as Greater Dammam, which has an estimated population of 4,140,000 as of 2012 and is closely linked to the city through social, economic, and cultural ties. The city is growing at an exceptionally fast rate of 12% a year{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} - the fastest in Saudi Arabia, the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], and the Arab world.\nAs of 2016 Greater Dammam is the 4th largest area in both size and population in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC).\nThe Dammam metropolitan area and the rest of the Eastern Province are served by the [[King Fahd International Airport]] (KFIA), the largest airport in the world in terms of land area (approximately 780&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), about 20&nbsp;km to the northwest of the city. [[Dammam]]'s [[King Abdul Aziz Sea Port]] is the largest on the [[Persian Gulf]]. Its import-export traffic in is second only to [[Jeddah Seaport]] in the Middle East and North Africa ([[MENA]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the name \"Dammam\" are disputed. Some say that it is onomatopoeic and was given to the area because of a drum positioned in a nearby keep, which was sounded (in a pattern called \"damdamah\") to alert the residents of returning fishermen's ships. Others say that the name comes from the Arabic word \"dawwama\" (whirlpool), which indicated a nearby sea site that [[dhow]]s usually had to avoid.\n\n==History==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2019}}\nDammam was formed in 1923 by [[Dawasir|Al-Dawasir tribe]] that migrated from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia after King Abdul Aziz allowed them to settle.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5kGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Architecture and Globalisation in the Persian Gulf Region|last=Golzari|first=Nasser|date=2016-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317179443|language=en}}</ref> the tribe settled in Al-Khobar the location was chosen for its proximity of the island of Bahrain as the clan hoped to head back there soon, but the British rule in the region made it very hard for them to move in every sense (''\"divide et impera\"'') so they finally realized they had to settle for good in the lands which by that time they already inhabited. However this tiny episode gave a population to Khobar boost as well as close ties with the bigger city of Dammam.\n\nWhen the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, the area was the site of several hamlets that depended on fishing and pearls for their survival. Over a span of a little more than half a century, the area has developed into a thriving hub of industry, commerce and science, and home to more than a million people. The area's transformation was launched with the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. The Eastern Province sits atop one of the largest oil fields in the world, and it was here in Dhahran in 1936 that Aramco, the predecessor of the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco, dug the famous Dammam No. 7 well that proved beyond doubt that the Kingdom possessed a large supply of hydrocarbons.\n\nThe discovery of new oil fields to the south, west and north of Dammam in the 1940s and 1950s, which now account for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, triggered a building boom. The Albinali Family, led by Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Albinali and Brothers played a crucial role in the development of the city of Dammam and the Eastern province in various fields. This company was the first Saudi construction company to develop Aramco, the roads from connecting the new industry's roads necessary for the economical development of the country. To name a few are: Dammam to the pertrolum wells to the north, Dammam to Riyadh, Dammam Port Expansion so tankers can load up (multiple expansions), the first covered shopping center in 1953 in the city of Dammam known as Ayal-Nasir (Sons of Nasir). This in turn led to expatriates and  technicians from throughout the kingdom and the world gathering to help search for new oil fields and bring them on-stream. New pipelines had to be installed, storage facilities built and jetties constructed to handle tankers. The growing number of experts working in Dhahran required the building of housing, hospitals, schools for their children and other amenities. Before long, Dhahran, the corporate headquarters of Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in the world, was spilling out into the desert in all directions.\n[[File:Dammam Highway.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dammam Highway]]\nThe growth of the oil industry in the region had a similar impact on the small fishing village of Dammam and the hamlet of Al-Khobar. Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mudbrick huts of the fisherman that crowded the shore and which constituted the only permanent dwellings in the area had given way to concrete buildings, modern housing, highways and landscaped streets. Located to the east of Dhahran on the Persian Gulf coast, Al-Khobar briefly became the shipping point for Saudi Arabian crude oil to the refinery in Bahrain. In the years leading up to World War II, Saudi Arabian oil production was very limited, and since the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent by small tankers to Bahrain. With the construction of a pipeline to Bahrain and the subsequent expansion of the oil industry in the post-war years, the focus of the shipping and oil industries shifted away from Al-Khobar northward to Dammam and Ras Tanura, one of the largest oil storage and shipping centers in the world, located 25&nbsp;km to the north of Dammam. As a result, Al-Khobar gradually found a new role as the commercial center for the entire region.\n\nIn the early 1980s Dammam, the capital of the Eastern Region, was a separate city but so close to Al Khobar and Dhahran that the traveler could pass from one to the other in a few minutes. The discovery of oil in Dhahran and nearby fields and the growing importance of the entire region affected Dammam more than any other city in Saudi Arabia. Within three decades, the sleepy little fishing village had become the capital of the Eastern Province. The simultaneous growth of Dammam, Dhahran and Al-Khobar brought the three jurisdictions into physical contact, the three towns inevitably merged into one, creating a single municipality known as the Dammam metropolitan area, referred to simply as the Dammam Area. Each of the three towns which compose the Dammam Area retain their own character and some local administrative functions but, in terms of its place in the Kingdom, the Dammam Area forms a single administrative entity.\n\nThe growth of the Saudi Arabian oil industry into the largest in the world brought about the rapid development of the region. As oil production increased, so did the number of people required to run the industry. The growing population needed more housing and services. First-rate hospitals and schools provided further incentives for people considering a move to the area. Service industries sprouted up to support the oil industry and meet the needs of people living in the Dammam Area. As a result, a region which had several hundred inhabitants some sixty years ago now boasts a population of well over 1.5&nbsp;million, growing at a pace of over five percent a year.\n\nThe key to the success of the Dammam Area is that unlike oil towns in other parts of the world, it has developed in all spheres. It is now a modern urban and industrial center which happens to be the headquarters of the Saudi Arabian oil industry. As this sector was growing in the early years, the Saudi Arabian government took steps to facilitate the evolution of the Dammam Area. New roads and highways connected the area to other urban and industrial centers in the Kingdom. A railway line connected Dammam to the agricultural center of Al-Kharj and on to Riyadh. Dhahran International Airport was established between Dhahran and Al-Khobar to connect the region to other parts of the Kingdom and the world.\n\n[[File:Dammam and Khobar.jpg|thumb|Dammam and [[Khobar]]]]\nTo encourage the growth of non-oil industries, an industrial city was established in the open space between the three cities. Now home to more than 124 factories, the industrial complex is completely engulfed by an urban mass. As a result, a second industrial city was established further away from the Dammam Area along the highway to Riyadh. Located on nearly {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} of land, the Second Industrial City is already home to 120 factories, with 160 others under construction. These plants manufacture a variety of consumer and industrial products that are marketed throughout the Kingdom and are exported to other countries around the world. Handling such exports, as well as imports from abroad, is the domain of shipping agents and commercial companies located in Dammam and Al-Khobar, making the Dammam Area not only a major oil producing and exporting area, but also a commercial and shipping center.\n\nThe growth of the region has necessitated the construction of a larger and more modern airport to replace the Dhahran International Airport which is now cramped for space. The new King Fahd International Airport, located {{convert|20|km|mi}} to the northwest of Dammam, serves not only the Dammam Area but also the Jubail Industrial City, some {{convert|60|km|mi}} to the north.\n\nAs it has in other parts of the Kingdom, the Ministry of Health has established several modern hospitals and a network of health care centers in the Dammam Area. These are supplemented by hospitals and clinics set up by the private sector.\n\nHaving been built from the ground up, the Dammam Area was designed from the outset on the principles of modern urban planning. Residential areas are separate from commercial sections, roads are broad and straight and buildings conform to a master plan. One of the main features of the development of the area is land reclamation. Vast stretches of the shallow Persian Gulf waters have been filled, with hotels and office buildings occupying what were once marshes. Water for household, urban and industrial use is provided by desalination plants that supply approximately seven million cubic feet of treated water to the area each day. The availability of water underpins the urban and industrial growth of the Dammam Area, and provisions have been made for expanding existing desalination facilities to meet future growth.\n\nThe Dammam-Dhahran-Khobar area is a major hub for shipping, oil, commerce and industry. Tankers take on oil at the terminal in Ras Tanura.\nThe Dammam Area is also famous for the wide variety of recreational facilities it offers residents and visitors alike.\n\nIn many ways, the Dammam Area has evolved as the link between Saudi Arabia and the outside world, exporting the Kingdom's products and importing its needs and thriving on the interaction between Saudi Arabia and other countries.<ref name=\"the-saudi.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-saudi.net/saudi-arabia/dammam/Dammam%20City%20-%20Saudi%20Arabia.htm |title=Dammam City Profile, Saudi Arabia |publisher=The-saudi.net |date= |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\n{{expand list|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:Ghornata area 2014-01-19 22-41.jpg|thumbnail|Ghornata area]] {{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* Abdallah Fouad\n* Ad Dawaser \n* Ad Dhabab\n* Al Adamah\n* Al Amamrah\n* Al Amanah\n* Al Amir Talaal\n* Al Aml\n* Al Anoud\n* Al Anwar\n* Al Athir\n* Al Aziziyah\n* Al Badee\n* Al Badiyah\n* Al Basatin\n* Al Buhayrah\n* Al Eskan\n* Al Etisalat\n* Al Faiha\n* Al Faisaliyah\n* Al Fakhriyah\n* Al Fanar (Marina)\n* Al Firdaws\n* Al Fursan\n* Al Hamra\n* Al Hussam\n* Al Jalawiyah\n* Al Jam'iyin\n* Al Jawhara\n* Al Khalidiyah Al Janubiyah\n* Al Khalidiyah Al Shamaliyah\n* Al Khalij\n* Al Khodaryah\n* Al Manar\n* Al Matar\n* Al Mazruiyah\n* Al Mubarakiya\n* Al Muhammadiyah\n* Al Muntazah\n* Al Muraikabat\n* Al Qazzaz\n* Al Qadisiyah (8)\n* Al Safa\n* Al Shatie Al Garbi\n* Al Shatie Al Sharqi\n* Al Tubayshi\n* Al Wahah\n* An Nada\n* An Nakheel\n* An Nasriyah\n* An Nawras (Petromin)\n* An nur\n* An Nuzhah\n* Ar rabi\n* Ar Rakah Ash Shamaliyah\n* Ar Rawdha (37)\n* Ar Rayyan \n* Ash Sharq\n* Ash shulah \n* As Sadafa\n* As Safa\n* As Saif\n* As salam\n* As Souq \n* Az Zuhur\n* Bader (91)\n* Ghurnata (75)\n* Ibn Khaldoun\n* 1st Industrial City\n* 2nd Industrial City\n* King Abdul Aziz Sea Port\n* King Fahd Suburb\n* Madinat Al Ummal \n* Muhammad bin Saud\n* Ohud (71)\n* Tayba\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Climate==\nDammam has a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'') under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3555/ |title=Climate: Dammam - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}</ref> The winter temperatures range from mild to warm, but regularly drop to as low as around {{convert|8|\u00b0C}} some days.

The judicial and administrative bodies of the province, plus several government departments, are located in the city. Dammam is the largest city in the Eastern Province, and the sixth largest in Saudi Arabia, after [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Taif]].<ref name = \"ArabNews\">{{cite web |title=Riyadh most populous Saudi city, Makkah most populous province |url= http://www.arabnews.com/node/407209 |publisher=Arab News |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref> Like the other 12 [[Regions of Saudi Arabia|regional capitals of Saudi Arabia]], Dammam is not included within any [[List of governorates of Saudi Arabia|governorate]]; instead, it is governed as a \"municipality\" ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629}}; ''[[Amanah (administrative subdivision)|amanah]]'') headed by a [[mayor]] ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646}}; ''amin'').\n\nDammam is a major administrative center for the Saudi oil industry. Together with the nearby cities of [[Dhahran]] and [[Khobar|Al Khobar]], Dammam and its suburbs form the center of the [[Dammam metropolitan area]], also known as Greater Dammam, which has an estimated population of 4,140,000 as of 2012 and is closely linked to the city through social, economic, and cultural ties. The city is growing at an exceptionally fast rate of 12% a year{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} - the fastest in Saudi Arabia, the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], and the Arab world.\nAs of 2016 Greater Dammam is the 4th largest area in both size and population in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC).\nThe Dammam metropolitan area and the rest of the Eastern Province are served by the [[King Fahd International Airport]] (KFIA), the largest airport in the world in terms of land area (approximately 780&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), about 20&nbsp;km to the northwest of the city. [[Dammam]]'s [[King Abdul Aziz Sea Port]] is the largest on the [[Persian Gulf]]. Its import-export traffic in is second only to [[Jeddah Seaport]] in the Middle East and North Africa ([[MENA]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the name \"Dammam\" are disputed. Some say that it is onomatopoeic and was given to the area because of a drum positioned in a nearby keep, which was sounded (in a pattern called \"damdamah\") to alert the residents of returning fishermen's ships. Others say that the name comes from the Arabic word \"dawwama\" (whirlpool), which indicated a nearby sea site that [[dhow]]s usually had to avoid.\n\n==History==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2019}}\nDammam was formed in 1923 by [[Dawasir|Al-Dawasir tribe]] that migrated from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia after King Abdul Aziz allowed them to settle.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5kGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Architecture and Globalisation in the Persian Gulf Region|last=Golzari|first=Nasser|date=2016-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317179443|language=en}}</ref> the tribe settled in Al-Khobar the location was chosen for its proximity of the island of Bahrain as the clan hoped to head back there soon, but the British rule in the region made it very hard for them to move in every sense (''\"divide et impera\"'') so they finally realized they had to settle for good in the lands which by that time they already inhabited. However this tiny episode gave a population to Khobar boost as well as close ties with the bigger city of Dammam.\n\nWhen the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, the area was the site of several hamlets that depended on fishing and pearls for their survival. Over a span of a little more than half a century, the area has developed into a thriving hub of industry, commerce and science, and home to more than a million people. The area's transformation was launched with the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. The Eastern Province sits atop one of the largest oil fields in the world, and it was here in Dhahran in 1936 that Aramco, the predecessor of the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco, dug the famous Dammam No. 7 well that proved beyond doubt that the Kingdom possessed a large supply of hydrocarbons.\n\nThe discovery of new oil fields to the south, west and north of Dammam in the 1940s and 1950s, which now account for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, triggered a building boom. The Albinali Family, led by Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Albinali and Brothers played a crucial role in the development of the city of Dammam and the Eastern province in various fields. This company was the first Saudi construction company to develop Aramco, the roads from connecting the new industry's roads necessary for the economical development of the country. To name a few are: Dammam to the pertrolum wells to the north, Dammam to Riyadh, Dammam Port Expansion so tankers can load up (multiple expansions), the first covered shopping center in 1953 in the city of Dammam known as Ayal-Nasir (Sons of Nasir). This in turn led to expatriates and  technicians from throughout the kingdom and the world gathering to help search for new oil fields and bring them on-stream. New pipelines had to be installed, storage facilities built and jetties constructed to handle tankers. The growing number of experts working in Dhahran required the building of housing, hospitals, schools for their children and other amenities. Before long, Dhahran, the corporate headquarters of Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in the world, was spilling out into the desert in all directions.\n[[File:Dammam Highway.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dammam Highway]]\nThe growth of the oil industry in the region had a similar impact on the small fishing village of Dammam and the hamlet of Al-Khobar. Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mudbrick huts of the fisherman that crowded the shore and which constituted the only permanent dwellings in the area had given way to concrete buildings, modern housing, highways and landscaped streets. Located to the east of Dhahran on the Persian Gulf coast, Al-Khobar briefly became the shipping point for Saudi Arabian crude oil to the refinery in Bahrain. In the years leading up to World War II, Saudi Arabian oil production was very limited, and since the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent by small tankers to Bahrain. With the construction of a pipeline to Bahrain and the subsequent expansion of the oil industry in the post-war years, the focus of the shipping and oil industries shifted away from Al-Khobar northward to Dammam and Ras Tanura, one of the largest oil storage and shipping centers in the world, located 25&nbsp;km to the north of Dammam. As a result, Al-Khobar gradually found a new role as the commercial center for the entire region.\n\nIn the early 1980s Dammam, the capital of the Eastern Region, was a separate city but so close to Al Khobar and Dhahran that the traveler could pass from one to the other in a few minutes. The discovery of oil in Dhahran and nearby fields and the growing importance of the entire region affected Dammam more than any other city in Saudi Arabia. Within three decades, the sleepy little fishing village had become the capital of the Eastern Province. The simultaneous growth of Dammam, Dhahran and Al-Khobar brought the three jurisdictions into physical contact, the three towns inevitably merged into one, creating a single municipality known as the Dammam metropolitan area, referred to simply as the Dammam Area. Each of the three towns which compose the Dammam Area retain their own character and some local administrative functions but, in terms of its place in the Kingdom, the Dammam Area forms a single administrative entity.\n\nThe growth of the Saudi Arabian oil industry into the largest in the world brought about the rapid development of the region. As oil production increased, so did the number of people required to run the industry. The growing population needed more housing and services. First-rate hospitals and schools provided further incentives for people considering a move to the area. Service industries sprouted up to support the oil industry and meet the needs of people living in the Dammam Area. As a result, a region which had several hundred inhabitants some sixty years ago now boasts a population of well over 1.5&nbsp;million, growing at a pace of over five percent a year.\n\nThe key to the success of the Dammam Area is that unlike oil towns in other parts of the world, it has developed in all spheres. It is now a modern urban and industrial center which happens to be the headquarters of the Saudi Arabian oil industry. As this sector was growing in the early years, the Saudi Arabian government took steps to facilitate the evolution of the Dammam Area. New roads and highways connected the area to other urban and industrial centers in the Kingdom. A railway line connected Dammam to the agricultural center of Al-Kharj and on to Riyadh. Dhahran International Airport was established between Dhahran and Al-Khobar to connect the region to other parts of the Kingdom and the world.\n\n[[File:Dammam and Khobar.jpg|thumb|Dammam and [[Khobar]]]]\nTo encourage the growth of non-oil industries, an industrial city was established in the open space between the three cities. Now home to more than 124 factories, the industrial complex is completely engulfed by an urban mass. As a result, a second industrial city was established further away from the Dammam Area along the highway to Riyadh. Located on nearly {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} of land, the Second Industrial City is already home to 120 factories, with 160 others under construction. These plants manufacture a variety of consumer and industrial products that are marketed throughout the Kingdom and are exported to other countries around the world. Handling such exports, as well as imports from abroad, is the domain of shipping agents and commercial companies located in Dammam and Al-Khobar, making the Dammam Area not only a major oil producing and exporting area, but also a commercial and shipping center.\n\nThe growth of the region has necessitated the construction of a larger and more modern airport to replace the Dhahran International Airport which is now cramped for space. The new King Fahd International Airport, located {{convert|20|km|mi}} to the northwest of Dammam, serves not only the Dammam Area but also the Jubail Industrial City, some {{convert|60|km|mi}} to the north.\n\nAs it has in other parts of the Kingdom, the Ministry of Health has established several modern hospitals and a network of health care centers in the Dammam Area. These are supplemented by hospitals and clinics set up by the private sector.\n\nHaving been built from the ground up, the Dammam Area was designed from the outset on the principles of modern urban planning. Residential areas are separate from commercial sections, roads are broad and straight and buildings conform to a master plan. One of the main features of the development of the area is land reclamation. Vast stretches of the shallow Persian Gulf waters have been filled, with hotels and office buildings occupying what were once marshes. Water for household, urban and industrial use is provided by desalination plants that supply approximately seven million cubic feet of treated water to the area each day. The availability of water underpins the urban and industrial growth of the Dammam Area, and provisions have been made for expanding existing desalination facilities to meet future growth.\n\nThe Dammam-Dhahran-Khobar area is a major hub for shipping, oil, commerce and industry. Tankers take on oil at the terminal in Ras Tanura.\nThe Dammam Area is also famous for the wide variety of recreational facilities it offers residents and visitors alike.\n\nIn many ways, the Dammam Area has evolved as the link between Saudi Arabia and the outside world, exporting the Kingdom's products and importing its needs and thriving on the interaction between Saudi Arabia and other countries.<ref name=\"the-saudi.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-saudi.net/saudi-arabia/dammam/Dammam%20City%20-%20Saudi%20Arabia.htm |title=Dammam City Profile, Saudi Arabia |publisher=The-saudi.net |date= |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\n{{expand list|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:Ghornata area 2014-01-19 22-41.jpg|thumbnail|Ghornata area]] {{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* Abdallah Fouad\n* Ad Dawaser \n* Ad Dhabab\n* Al Adamah\n* Al Amamrah\n* Al Amanah\n* Al Amir Talaal\n* Al Aml\n* Al Anoud\n* Al Anwar\n* Al Athir\n* Al Aziziyah\n* Al Badee\n* Al Badiyah\n* Al Basatin\n* Al Buhayrah\n* Al Eskan\n* Al Etisalat\n* Al Faiha\n* Al Faisaliyah\n* Al Fakhriyah\n* Al Fanar (Marina)\n* Al Firdaws\n* Al Fursan\n* Al Hamra\n* Al Hussam\n* Al Jalawiyah\n* Al Jam'iyin\n* Al Jawhara\n* Al Khalidiyah Al Janubiyah\n* Al Khalidiyah Al Shamaliyah\n* Al Khalij\n* Al Khodaryah\n* Al Manar\n* Al Matar\n* Al Mazruiyah\n* Al Mubarakiya\n* Al Muhammadiyah\n* Al Muntazah\n* Al Muraikabat\n* Al Qazzaz\n* Al Qadisiyah (8)\n* Al Safa\n* Al Shatie Al Garbi\n* Al Shatie Al Sharqi\n* Al Tubayshi\n* Al Wahah\n* An Nada\n* An Nakheel\n* An Nasriyah\n* An Nawras (Petromin)\n* An nur\n* An Nuzhah\n* Ar rabi\n* Ar Rakah Ash Shamaliyah\n* Ar Rawdha (37)\n* Ar Rayyan \n* Ash Sharq\n* Ash shulah \n* As Sadafa\n* As Safa\n* As Saif\n* As salam\n* As Souq \n* Az Zuhur\n* Bader (91)\n* Ghurnata (75)\n* Ibn Khaldoun\n* 1st Industrial City\n* 2nd Industrial City\n* King Abdul Aziz Sea Port\n* King Fahd Suburb\n* Madinat Al Ummal \n* Muhammad bin Saud\n* Ohud (71)\n* Tayba\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Climate==\nDammam has a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'') under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3555/ |title=Climate: Dammam - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}</ref> The winter temperatures range from mild to warm, but regularly drop to as low as around {{convert|8|\u00b0C}} some days.

A recent study (T.M. Iwalewa et al., 2016) revealed that leakages from drinking-water supply and sewage-collection pipe networks are the major contributors to the rise in the water table in the city. The study showed that the rising shallow water-table problem represents a serious threat to the present and future development of the city.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Saudi Aramco airplanes parked in the general aviation terminal, King Fahd International Airport.JPG|thumb|Saudi Aramco airplanes parked in the general aviation terminal in [[King Fahd International Airport]] in Dammam, [[Saudi Arabia]]]]\n\n===Air===\nDammam is served by the [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area.

[[List of Family Guy characters#Vinny|Vinny]] learns that [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]], [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]'s father, canceled the carnival. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] confronts Carter, who tells him that it was cancelled because he despises the Christmas season. Peter vows to help Carter find his Christmas spirit. Peter tries a fake story letter, making Carter drink [[egg nog]] in a hotel room, and having him [[masturbation|masturbate]], to no effect. When Peter accuses Carter of acting Jewish, Carter reverses his position on the carnival.\n\nDespite being re-established at the Quahog Mall, the Christmas Carnival fails to raise Stewie's spirits. When the [[Santa Claus|Mall Santa Claus]] asks Stewie what he wants for Christmas, Stewie realizes he wants [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] back. Vinny pretends to be Brian, acting like an intellectual and a writer, but fails to cheer up Stewie. Trying to raise his spirits, Vinny and Stewie return to the Quahog Mall, where Stewie spots his past self time travelling to purchase a gift. Remembering the time travel occurred prior to Brian's death, Stewie realizes he can use Past Stewie's return pad to save Brian. Vinny appeals to Past Stewie's vanity to obtain his backpack, and brings it to Present Stewie. Stewie says goodbye to Vinny, whom he and the family will no longer have met if Brian lives.\n\nStewie arrives in the past, saving Brian from being hit by the car. After explaining the situation to Brian, Stewie sends the return pad back to his past self in order to prevent a [[temporal paradox]]. Now unable to return and having altered his past, Stewie fades from existence as Brian thanks him for his actions. Unaware of what occurred, Past Stewie comes out of the house and wonders who Brian was talking to.\n\nIn the present on Christmas Day, Brian is alive and well. Grateful to him for saving his life, Brian thanks Stewie, who remains oblivious to his averted death, as well as his alternate self's actions.\n\n==Reception==\nEric Thurm of ''[[The A.V.
