[[Benjamin Holt]] attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to {{convert|7.5|ft}} tall and {{convert|6|ft}} wide, producing a tractor {{convert|46|ft}} wide. But this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain.\n\n[[File:Cat45-mojave.jpg|thumb|Two [[Holt tractor|Holt 45]] gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the [[Mojave Desert]] during construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1909.]]\nAnother solution considered was to lay a temporary [[plank road]] ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a {{convert|40|hp}} Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy [[Delta (landform)|delta land]] of [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Roberts Island]].<ref name=\"laird\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Benjamin Holt (1849\u20131920): The Father of the Caterpillar tractor |first=Gwenyth Laird |last=Pernie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803071138/http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nContemporaneously [[Richard Hornsby & Sons]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, developed a steel plate tracked vehicle which it patented in 1904. This tractor steered by differential braking of the tracks and did not require the forward tiller steering wheel for steering making it the first to do so.  Several tractors were made and sold to operate in the Yukon, one example of which was in operation until 1927 remnants of which still exist to this day. However, Hornsby were unable to interest the British Military in 1907, although soldiers who witnessed the trials nicknamed the machine a caterpillar.  Hornsby therefore found a limited market for their tractor so they sold their patent to Holt in 1911, the same year Holt trademarked \"Caterpillar\".\n\nCompany photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a [[caterpillar]],<ref name=\"about-inventors\">{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventions/a/bulldozer.htm |title=History of Bulldozers| first= Mary |last=Bellis|publisher= About.com |accessdate=2010-02-28 }}</ref> and Holt seized on the metaphor. \"Caterpillar it is.

Military contracts formed the major part of the company's production. When the war ended, Holt's planned expansion to meet the military's needs was abruptly terminated. The heavy-duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers. The company's situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.\n\n[[C. L. Best|C. L. Best Gas Tractor Company]], formed by Clarence Leo Best in 1910 and Holt's primary competitor, had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed.<ref name=ohecat/><ref name=acmoc3>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmoc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35&limit=1&limitstart=3 |title=Caterpillar History |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235730/https://www.acmoc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35&limit=1&limitstart=3 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> As a result, Best had gained a considerable market advantage over Holt by war's end. Best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion, especially production of its new Best Model 60 \"Tracklayer\".\n\nBoth companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy, which contributed to a nationwide [[Depression of 1920\u201321|depression]], further inhibiting sales.

CTCT develops positioning and control products for earthmoving and paving machines in the construction and mining industries, using technologies such as GNSS, optical total stations, lasers and sonics. The products are used in a range of applications where the operator of the machine benefits from having accurate horizontal and vertical guidance. CTCT is based in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and started its operations on April 1, 2002.\n\n===Agriculture products===\nCaterpillar introduced the ''Challenger'' range of agricultural [[tractors]] as the result of several development programs over a long period of time. The program started in the 1970s and involved both D6-based units and Grader power units. A parallel program was also developing wheeled high hp tractors based on using the articulated loading shovel chassis was latter merged with the crawler team. The result was the Challenger Tractor and the \"Mobi-Trac\" system.\n\nThe Challenger has been marketed in Europe as [[Claas]] machines since 1997, with Caterpillar marketing the Claas-built Lexion combine range in the USA. Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture, ''Claas Omaha'', to build [[combine harvester]]s in Omaha, Nebraska, USA under the ''CAT'' brand. In 2002, Cat sold its stake to Claas, and licensed the use of ''CAT'' and the CAT yellow livery to Claas. They are marketed as ''Lexion'' combines now.\n\nAlso in 2002, Caterpillar sold the ''Challenger'' tracked tractor business to [[AGCO]] and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them. This ended Cat's venture into agriculture.\n\n===Financial products and brand licensing===\nCaterpillar provides financing and insurance to customers via its worldwide dealer network <ref name=about/> and generates income through the licensing of the Caterpillar and CAT trademarks and logos.\n\n=== Brand licensing ===\n[[File:Caterpillar-brand work boot.jpg|right|thumb|Caterpillar-branded work boots manufactured by [[Wolverine World Wide]]]]\n\nCaterpillar sells the right to manufacture, market and sell products bearing the Cat trademark to licensees worldwide.

Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations.\n\nIn 1992, the [[United Auto Workers]] conducted a five-month strike against Caterpillar. In response, Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar's entire unionized work force. Over ten thousand UAW members struck again in 1994\u20131995 for 17 months, a record at that time. The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Caterpillar-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Caterpillar Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1994, Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from $35,000 to $39,000 per year.

It suspended [[research and development]] work, sending thousands of engineers and other non-bargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members.\n\nRather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers, Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor. One way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms.

Caterpillar's Cast Metals Organization in Mapleton worked with the American Foundry Society to help produce a rule to reduce hazardous waste in scrap metal that meet strict quality requirements, and also allow foundries to continue recycling certain types of scrap and maintain a competitive cost structure. Caterpillar's Mossville Engine Center formed a team to look at used oil reuse and recycle processes that forced MEC to send large amounts of used oil off-site for recycling, and developed an updated system for reclaiming it for reuse on-site. The resulting benefits included a usage reduction of about {{convert|208,000|USgal|m3}} of oil per year.<ref>[http://dnr.state.il.us/PUBAFFAIRS/2007/Oct/illinois.html Illinois Department Of Natural Resources October 25, 2007.

The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with [[defeat device]]s, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines \"...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx). In 1998 alone, these violating vehicles emitted 1.3 million tons of additional NOx \u2013 an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars.\" For this reason, Caterpillar was named the \"Clean Air Villain of the Month\" for August 2000 by the [[Clean Air Trust]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cleanairtrust.org/villain.0800.html\n|title=Six Diesel Engine Companies\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n|date=2000-08-01\n|work=Clean Air Villain of the Month\n|publisher=Clean Air Trust\n}}</ref> The consent decree provided that $83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards.

Those investigations uncovered significant changes in Caterpillar's offshore tax strategy, culminating in the creation of the new Swiss subsidiary Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) in [[Geneva]]. In 1999, the former Caterpillar executive Daniel Schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits from replacement parts to Switzerland where it had no warehouses or factories. The Internal Revenue Service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years 2007 to 2009.<ref name=\"A Fine Mess\">{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=T.

[[Benjamin Holt]] attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to {{convert|7.5|ft}} tall and {{convert|6|ft}} wide, producing a tractor {{convert|46|ft}} wide. But this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain.\n\n[[File:Cat45-mojave.jpg|thumb|Two [[Holt tractor|Holt 45]] gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the [[Mojave Desert]] during construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1909.]]\nAnother solution considered was to lay a temporary [[plank road]] ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a {{convert|40|hp}} Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy [[Delta (landform)|delta land]] of [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Roberts Island]].<ref name=\"laird\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Benjamin Holt (1849\u20131920): The Father of the Caterpillar tractor |first=Gwenyth Laird |last=Pernie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803071138/http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nContemporaneously [[Richard Hornsby & Sons]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, developed a steel plate tracked vehicle which it patented in 1904. This tractor steered by differential braking of the tracks and did not require the forward tiller steering wheel for steering making it the first to do so.  Several tractors were made and sold to operate in the Yukon, one example of which was in operation until 1927 remnants of which still exist to this day. However, Hornsby were unable to interest the British Military in 1907, although soldiers who witnessed the trials nicknamed the machine a caterpillar.  Hornsby therefore found a limited market for their tractor so they sold their patent to Holt in 1911, the same year Holt trademarked \"Caterpillar\".\n\nCompany photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a [[caterpillar]],<ref name=\"about-inventors\">{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventions/a/bulldozer.htm |title=History of Bulldozers| first= Mary |last=Bellis|publisher= About.com |accessdate=2010-02-28 }}</ref> and Holt seized on the metaphor. \"Caterpillar it is.

That company had collaborated with Hornsby in the development of the vehicles demonstrated to the British military in 1907, providing the paraffin (kerosene) engines.\n\nHolt's track-type tractors played a support role in World War I.

Military contracts formed the major part of the company's production. When the war ended, Holt's planned expansion to meet the military's needs was abruptly terminated. The heavy-duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers. The company's situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.\n\n[[C. L. Best|C. L.

Best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion, especially production of its new Best Model 60 \"Tracklayer\".\n\nBoth companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy, which contributed to a nationwide [[Depression of 1920\u201321|depression]], further inhibiting sales.

CTCT develops positioning and control products for earthmoving and paving machines in the construction and mining industries, using technologies such as GNSS, optical total stations, lasers and sonics. The products are used in a range of applications where the operator of the machine benefits from having accurate horizontal and vertical guidance. CTCT is based in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and started its operations on April 1, 2002.\n\n===Agriculture products===\nCaterpillar introduced the ''Challenger'' range of agricultural [[tractors]] as the result of several development programs over a long period of time. The program started in the 1970s and involved both D6-based units and Grader power units. A parallel program was also developing wheeled high hp tractors based on using the articulated loading shovel chassis was latter merged with the crawler team. The result was the Challenger Tractor and the \"Mobi-Trac\" system.\n\nThe Challenger has been marketed in Europe as [[Claas]] machines since 1997, with Caterpillar marketing the Claas-built Lexion combine range in the USA. Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture, ''Claas Omaha'', to build [[combine harvester]]s in Omaha, Nebraska, USA under the ''CAT'' brand. In 2002, Cat sold its stake to Claas, and licensed the use of ''CAT'' and the CAT yellow livery to Claas. They are marketed as ''Lexion'' combines now.\n\nAlso in 2002, Caterpillar sold the ''Challenger'' tracked tractor business to [[AGCO]] and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them. This ended Cat's venture into agriculture.\n\n===Financial products and brand licensing===\nCaterpillar provides financing and insurance to customers via its worldwide dealer network <ref name=about/> and generates income through the licensing of the Caterpillar and CAT trademarks and logos.\n\n=== Brand licensing ===\n[[File:Caterpillar-brand work boot.jpg|right|thumb|Caterpillar-branded work boots manufactured by [[Wolverine World Wide]]]]\n\nCaterpillar sells the right to manufacture, market and sell products bearing the Cat trademark to licensees worldwide.

Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations.\n\nIn 1992, the [[United Auto Workers]] conducted a five-month strike against Caterpillar. In response, Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar's entire unionized work force. Over ten thousand UAW members struck again in 1994\u20131995 for 17 months, a record at that time. The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Caterpillar-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Caterpillar Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1994, Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from $35,000 to $39,000 per year.

It suspended [[research and development]] work, sending thousands of engineers and other non-bargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members.\n\nRather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers, Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor. One way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms.

The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with [[defeat device]]s, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines \"...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx). In 1998 alone, these violating vehicles emitted 1.3 million tons of additional NOx \u2013 an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars.\" For this reason, Caterpillar was named the \"Clean Air Villain of the Month\" for August 2000 by the [[Clean Air Trust]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cleanairtrust.org/villain.0800.html\n|title=Six Diesel Engine Companies\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n|date=2000-08-01\n|work=Clean Air Villain of the Month\n|publisher=Clean Air Trust\n}}</ref> The consent decree provided that $83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards.

UNAVCO is funded by the National Science Foundation ([[National Science Foundation|NSF]]) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[Nasa|NASA]]) to support geoscience research around the world. UNAVCO operates the GAGE Facility (Geodetic Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience) on behalf of the NSF and NASA. As a university-governed consortium, UNAVCO supports the goals of the academic scientific community. UNAVCO has 120 US academic members and supports over 110 organizations globally as associate members.\n\n[[File:Unavco-membership.jpg|240px|thumb|right| UNAVCO Membership as of 2012]]\n\n==Tools and Services==\n\n===Data===\nThe UNAVCO GAGE Facility, as a [[World Data Center]], provides access to scientific data used for quantifying the motions of rock, ice, and water at or near Earth's surface. Geodetic GPS/GNSS Data (Global Navigation Satellite System / Global Positioning System Data), enable millimeter-scale surface motion measurements at discrete points. Geodetic Imaging Data are collected by a variety of different sensors deployed on satellites, aircraft, and on the ground, and provide high resolution terrain models and deformation measurements over areas of tens of meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Data collected from Strain and Seismic Borehole instruments measure the deformation at or near the surface of the Earth and measure rock physical properties in the vicinity of the installations. At many of the sites where geodetic measurements are made, Meteorological Data are also collected to aid in the processing of the geodetic data. Under the large EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, UNAVCO acquires, archives, and/or distributes a number of community data sets including GPS, strainmeter, borehole seismometer, tilt meter, and geodetic imaging with radar and lidar, as part of EarthScope's Plate Boundary Observatory.\n\nGPS data are available both via ftp and via a [http://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/data-access-methods/dai2/app/dai2.html data archive interface]:.\n\n===GPS/GNSS Systems===\nThe GAGE Facility manages a community pool of high accuracy portable [[GPS]]/GNSS receiver systems that can be used for a range of applications. These complete systems \u2013 receivers, antennas, mounts, power and optional communications \u2013 can be deployed for days in episodic campaigns or for many months long-term investigations. Systems are also available for precision mapping applications.\n\n===Terrestrial Laser Scanning===\nThe GAGE Facility at UNAVCO maintains a pool of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) instruments and associated peripherals, digital photography equipment, software and ancillary equipment optimized to support Earth science investigators. TLS technology is based on lidar (\"LIght raDAR\") and is also referred to as ground-based lidar or tripod lidar. It is an active imaging system whereby laser pulses are emitted by the scanner and observables include the range and intensity of pulse returns reflected by the surface or object being scanned.\n\nThe primary capability of TLS is the generation of high resolution 3D maps and images of surfaces and objects over scales of meters to kilometers with centimeter to sub-centimeter precision. Repeat TLS measurements allow the imaging and measurement of changes through time and in unprecedented detail, making TLS even more valuable for transformative science investigations.\n\nTLS is a powerful geodetic imaging tool ideal for supporting a wide spectrum of user applications in many different environments. Geoscience applications to date include detailed mapping of fault scarps, geologic outcrops, fault-surface roughness, frost polygons, [[lava lakes]], [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], [[fissures]], [[glaciers]], columnar joints and hillside drainages. Repeat TLS surveys allow the imaging and measurement of surface changes through time due, for example, to surface processes, volcanic deformation, [[ice flow]], beach morphology transitions, and post-seismic slip. The incorporation of GPS measurements provides accurate [[georeferencing]] of TLS data in an [[absolute reference frame]]. The addition of digital photography yields photorealistic 3D images. It has been demonstrated that TLS derived 3D imagery is a unique and powerful tool for educational and outreach applications as well.\n\n===Engineering Expertise===\nThe GAGE Facility provides engineering expertise and equipment resources to investigators in support of their geophysical research projects. This may include: Proposal planning, project logistics and support letters, field engineering support, modern GNSS equipment for loan to projects, permanent GPS station installations, operation, and maintenance, and/or data acquisition, quality control, transfer, management, and archiving.\n\nGAGE Facility engineers provide classroom and in-the-field training, project design and implementation, field engineering, TLS or GPS network operations, and technology development for GPS, TLS and other applications.\n\n===Polar Services===\nThe GAGE Facility provides geodetic support to NSF-OPP (National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs) funded researchers working in the Arctic and Antarctic. Survey-grade GPS receivers, Terrestrial Laser Scanners, and supporting power and communications systems for continuous data collection and campaign surveying are available. Operation and maintenance services are also provided for long term data collection, with on-line data distribution from the UNAVCO community archive.\n\n===GGN, GNSS, IGS Support===\nThe GAGE Facility provides global infrastructure support to NASA/JPL in operating a collection of high capability, globally distributed, permanent GPS stations called the Global GPS Network (GGN). Data from these stations are used to produce highly accurate products for GPS Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and education. UNAVCO also provides support for the International GNSS Service (IGS).\n\n===Short Courses, Workshops, Internships===\nThe GAGE Facility's Education and Community Engagement (ECE) program offers short courses and workshops. They focus on professional development, research, and education, strategic support for scientific investigators in developing broader impacts, in-residence programs for geodesy science community members and educators, professional development in geosciences for K-12 faculty, and for undergraduate students through RESESS (Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students), student internships to encourage broader participation in geosciences.\n\n===Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)===\nUNAVCO operates the [[Plate Boundary Observatory]] (PBO), the geodetic component of [[EarthScope]], funded by the National Science Foundation. The PBO consists of several major observatory components: a network of 1100+ permanent, continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations many of which provide data at high-rate and in real-time, 78 borehole seismometers, 74 borehole strainmeters, 28 shallow borehole tiltmeters, and six long baseline laser strainmeters. These instruments are complemented by InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and lidar imagery and geochronology.\n\n===Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet)===\nUNAVCO operates the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet)[1], which consists of 50 planned continuously operating GPS/weather stations integrated with 65 existing GPS stations operated by partner organizations, 15 of which will be upgraded with new equipment. COCONet provides free, high-quality, open-format GPS and meteorological data for these stations via the internet for use by scientists, government agencies, educators, students, and the private sector. These data are used by local and foreign researchers to study solid earth processes such as tectonic plate motions, tectonic plate boundary interaction and deformation, including earthquake cycle processes and risks. They also serve atmospheric scientists and weather forecasting groups by providing more precise estimates of tropospheric water vapor and enabling better forecasting of the dynamics of airborne moisture associated with the yearly Caribbean hurricane cycle.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\nUNAVCO was created in 1984 in response to the challenge of applying GPS to geosciences. At that time it was called the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO). At its inception, UNAVCO was housed within the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) at the [http://www.colorado.edu/ University of Colorado-Boulder]. In 1992, UNAVCO moved under the umbrella of the [http://www2.ucar.edu/ University Corporation for Atmospheric Research] (UCAR), also located in Boulder, Colorado. In 2001, UNAVCO, Inc. incorporated as an independent, non-profit, [501(c)(3)] corporation. For a one-year period, between April 2001 and September 2003, UCAR/UNAVCO and UNAVCO, Inc. both existed. In October 2003, funding for UCAR/UNAVCO ended and the staff and equipment of UCAR/UNAVCO moved to UNAVCO, Inc. UNAVCO, Inc. adopted the former acronym as its official name when it incorporated, though currently the acronym does not specifically stand for anything. In 2004, UNAVCO initiated a formal Education and Outreach program. That program was reconstituted in 2012 to become Education and Community Engagement. A complete UNAVCO timeline is available on [http://www.unavco.org/about/history/history.html their webpage].\n\n==Organization==\nAs of 2012, UNAVCO is organized into three programs. The three programs focus on: (1) data collection, including installation and maintenance of large-scale geodetic instrument networks [[#Geodetic Infrastructure|(Geodetic Infrastructure)]]; (2) network data operations, community data products, and cyberinfrastructure [[#Geodetic Data Services|(Geodetic Data Services)]]; and (3) education and outreach strategies [[#Education and Community Engagement|(Education and Community Engagement)]].\n\n===Geodetic Infrastructure===\nThe Geodetic Infrastructure (GI) program integrates all geodetic infrastructure and data acquisition capabilities for continuously operating observational networks and shorter-term deployments. Supported activities include development and testing, advanced systems engineering, the construction, operation, and maintenance of permanent geodetic instrument networks around the globe, and engineering services tailored to PI project requirements. Major projects currently supported by the GI program include the 1,112 station Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), Polar networks in Greenland and Antarctica (GNET and ANET, together known as POLENET), COCONet spanning the Caribbean plate boundary, the multi-disciplinary AfricaArray, and several other smaller continuously observing geodetic networks.\n\n===Geodetic Data Services===\nGeodetic Data Services (GDS) program provides services for the long-term stewardship of unique data sets. These services organize, manage, and archive data, and develop tools for data access and interpretation. GDS provides a comprehensive suite of services including sensor network data operations, data products and services, data management and archiving, and advanced cyberinfrastructure. Services are provided for GPS/GNSS data, Imaging data, Strain and Seismic data, and Meteorological data. GPS/GNSS data enable millimeter-scale surface motions at discrete points. Data from geodetic imaging instruments can be used to map topography and delineate deformation with high spatial resolution. InSAR and Terrestrial LiDAR imaging data services are provided. Strain and seismic data from borehole strainmeters, seismometers, thermometers, pore pressure transducers, tiltmeters, and rock samples from drilling, as well as surface-based tiltmeters and laser strainmeters are available. In addition, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure data are available from surface measurements of atmospheric conditions from stations. Tropospheric parameters are generated during daily GPS post-processing managed by UNAVCO and are accessible through data access services. The program is optimized to enable access to high-precision geodetic data. The [http://www.unavco.org/data/data.html UNAVCO Data Archive] includes more than 2,300 continuous GPS stations.\n\n===Education and Community Engagement===\nThe Education and Community Engagement program provides services to communicate the scientific results of the geodetic community, foster education across a broad range of learners, and grow workforce development and international partnerships. Particular focus is given to providing training, developing educational materials, and facilitating technical short courses to scientists studying geodesy. The program also supports formal education (K-12) and informal public outreach through workshops, educational materials for secondary students and undergraduate level courses, museum displays, and social media interactions. UNAVCO provides an annual series of short courses and workshops aimed at current researchers who want to update their skills or branch into new areas of geodetic research. UNAVCO Short Courses are offered to increase the capacity of the scientific community to process, analyze, and interpret various types of geodetic data. Educational Workshops promote a broader understanding of Earth science for college and secondary education faculty.\n\nUNAVCO supports geo-workforce development through undergraduate internship programs, graduate student mentoring, and online resources. The premier internship program for upper division undergraduate students is [http://resess.unavco.org/ Research Experience in the Solid Earth Science for Students] (RESESS). RESESS is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and ExxonMobil. It is a multi-year geoscience research internship as well as a community support and professional development program designed to increase the diversity of students entering the geosciences. Upper-division undergraduate students from underrepresented groups spend 11 weeks in Boulder, Colorado during the summer, conducting an independent geoscience-focused research project. RESESS is a summer internship program dedicated to increasing the diversity of students entering the geosciences. Interns work under the guidance of a research mentor and are mentored and supported throughout the academic year by RESESS program staff from UNAVCO. The alumni of RESESS are 55% Latino/Hispanic, 27% African American/Black, 11% Native American, and 7% Asian American. Of the 30 interns who have gone on to earn a bachelor's degree, 13 are enrolled in a master's degree program and 8 are currently enrolled in a doctoral program. Nine RESESS alumni are working in private industry, five of which are in the geosciences.<ref>Charlevoix & Morris Increasing Diversity in Geoscience Through Research Internships, EOS 95(8), 69\u201370(2014)</ref>\n\n==Membership and Governance==\nUNAVCO Members are educational or nonprofit institutions chartered in the United States (US) or its Territories with a commitment to scholarly research involving the application of high precision geodesy to Earth science or related fields. Members must also be willing to make a clear and continuing commitment to active participation in governance and science activities. Associate Membership is available to organizations other than U.S. educational institutions, when those organizations share UNAVCO's mission and otherwise meet the qualifications for membership.\n\nA Board of Directors is charged with UNAVCO oversight and governance, and is elected by designated representatives of UNAVCO member institutions. The Board works with the science community to create a broad interdisciplinary research agenda based on applications of geodetic technology, to identify investigator needs for infrastructure support, to develop proposals to appropriate sponsors to maintain that infrastructure capability, and to ensure that UNAVCO and its activities provide high quality, cost-effective, and responsive support. Advisory committees for each of the three programs guide the focus of the programs and help shape their initiatives.\n\n==Science==\nFor more than two decades, space-based geodetic observations have enabled measurement of the motions of the Earth's surface and crust at many different scales, with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail and increased precision, leading to fundamental discoveries in continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading.\n\nSpace geodesy furthers research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather.<ref>Geodesy in the 21st Century, Eos, Vol. 90, No. 18, 5 May 2009, by S.

The tectonic plates are continuously in motion, though so slowly that even with the highest precision instruments, months or years of observations are necessary to measure it. Over the last several decades, the advent of space-based geodetic techniques have improved the ability to measure tectonic plate motion by several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal resolution as well as accuracy, and to establish stable terrestrial and celestial reference frames required to achieve these improvements. The research with these systems has led to revolutionary progress in our understanding of plate boundaries and plate interiors.<ref>A. Newman, S. Stiros, L. Feng, P. Psimoulis, F. Moschas, V.

Geodetic observations are enabling researchers, for the first time, to follow the motion of water within Earth's system at global scales and to characterize changes in terrestrial groundwater storage at a variety of scales, ranging from continental-scale changes in water storage using gravity space missions, to regional and local changes using InSAR, GNSS, leveling, and relative gravity measurements of surface deformation accompanying aquifer-system compaction.<ref>[[Kristine M.

When the incident light in the experiment strikes the surface, localized surface plasmons are excited. The field enhancement is greatest when the [[plasmon]] frequency, \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, is in resonance with the radiation (<math>\\omega = \\omega_p/\\sqrt 3</math> for spherical particles). In order for scattering to occur, the plasmon oscillations must be perpendicular to the surface; if they are in-plane with the surface, no scattering will occur. It is because of this requirement that roughened surfaces or arrangements of [[nanoparticle]]s are typically employed in SERS experiments as these surfaces provide an area on which these localized collective [[oscillation]]s can occur.<ref name=\"Smith2005\">Smith, E.; Dent, G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpVcyQr_1DAC&printsec=frontcover Modern Raman Spectroscopy: A Practical Approach].

The dipolar term contributes to the plasmon oscillations, which leads to the enhancement.  The SERS effect is so pronounced because the field enhancement occurs twice. First, the field enhancement magnifies the intensity of incident light, which will excite the Raman [[normal mode|modes]] of the molecule being studied, therefore increasing the signal of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal is then further magnified by the surface due to the same mechanism that excited the incident light, resulting in a greater increase in the total output. At each stage the electric field is enhanced as E<sup>2</sup>, for a total enhancement of E<sup>4</sup>.<ref name=\"Moskovits\">Moskovits, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xlTw9WCUwEC&printsec=frontcover Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: a Brief Perspective].

For those frequencies for which the Raman signal is only slightly shifted from the incident light, both the incident [[laser]] light and the Raman signal can be near resonance with the plasmon frequency, leading to the E<sup>4</sup> enhancement.

Specific [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP) can be identified using this technique. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating on the dye-labeled regions of DNA or RNA, allowing SERS to be performed. This has several potential applications: For example, Cao et al. report that gene sequences for HIV, Ebola, Hepatitis, and Bacillus Anthracis can be uniquely identified using this technique. Each spectrum was specific, which is advantageous over fluorescence detection; some fluorescent markers overlap and interfere with other gene markers. The advantage of this technique to identify gene sequences is that several Raman dyes are commercially available, which could lead to the development of non-overlapping probes for gene detection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.297.5586.1536|title=Nanoparticles with Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprints for DNA and RNA Detection|date=2002|last1=Cao|first1=Y.

While the spectra of most SERS experiments are similar to the non-surface enhanced spectra, there are often differences in the number of modes present. Additional modes not found in the traditional Raman spectrum can be present in the SERS spectrum, while other modes can disappear. The modes observed in any spectroscopic experiment are dictated by the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the molecules and are usually summarized by [[Selection rule]]s. When molecules are adsorbed to a surface, the symmetry of the system can change, slightly modifying the symmetry of the molecule, which can lead to differences in mode selection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150667a013|title=Surface selection rules for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy: calculations and application to the surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of phthalazine on silver|date=1984|last1=Moskovits|first1=M.|last2=Suh|first2=J. S.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|issue=23|pages=5526\u20135530}}</ref>\n\nOne common way in which selection rules are modified arises from the fact that many molecules that have a [[center of symmetry]] lose that feature when adsorbed to a surface. The loss of a center of symmetry eliminates the requirements of the [[Rule of mutual exclusion|mutual exclusion rule]], which dictates that modes can only be either Raman or infrared active. Thus modes that would normally appear only in the [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrum]] of the free molecule can appear in the SERS spectrum.<ref name=\"Smith2005\"/>\n\nA molecule's symmetry can be changed in different ways depending on the orientation in which the molecule is attached to the surface. In some experiments, it is possible to determine the orientation of adsorption to the surface from the SERS spectrum, as different modes will be present depending on how the symmetry is modified.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(03)00215-8|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~agbrolo/JECau111bipy.pdf|title=The orientation of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine adsorbed at a SERS-active Au(111) electrode surface|date=2003|last1=Brolo|first1=A.G.|last2=Jiang|first2=Z.|last3=Irish|first3=D.E.|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=547|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Raman spectroscopy}}\n\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n[[Category:Raman scattering]]\n[[Category:Raman spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Plasmonics]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:sers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Raman spectrum of liquid 2-mercaptoethanol (below) and SERS spectrum of 2-mercaptoethanol monolayer formed on roughened silver (above).

There are two primary theories and while their mechanisms differ substantially, distinguishing them experimentally has not been straightforward.

When the incident light in the experiment strikes the surface, localized surface plasmons are excited. The field enhancement is greatest when the [[plasmon]] frequency, \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, is in resonance with the radiation (<math>\\omega = \\omega_p/\\sqrt 3</math> for spherical particles). In order for scattering to occur, the plasmon oscillations must be perpendicular to the surface; if they are in-plane with the surface, no scattering will occur. It is because of this requirement that roughened surfaces or arrangements of [[nanoparticle]]s are typically employed in SERS experiments as these surfaces provide an area on which these localized collective [[oscillation]]s can occur.<ref name=\"Smith2005\">Smith, E.; Dent, G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpVcyQr_1DAC&printsec=frontcover Modern Raman Spectroscopy: A Practical Approach].

The dipolar term contributes to the plasmon oscillations, which leads to the enhancement.  The SERS effect is so pronounced because the field enhancement occurs twice. First, the field enhancement magnifies the intensity of incident light, which will excite the Raman [[normal mode|modes]] of the molecule being studied, therefore increasing the signal of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal is then further magnified by the surface due to the same mechanism that excited the incident light, resulting in a greater increase in the total output. At each stage the electric field is enhanced as E<sup>2</sup>, for a total enhancement of E<sup>4</sup>.<ref name=\"Moskovits\">Moskovits, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xlTw9WCUwEC&printsec=frontcover Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: a Brief Perspective].

For those frequencies for which the Raman signal is only slightly shifted from the incident light, both the incident [[laser]] light and the Raman signal can be near resonance with the plasmon frequency, leading to the E<sup>4</sup> enhancement. When the frequency shift is large, the incident light and the Raman signal cannot both be on resonance with \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, thus the enhancement at both stages cannot be maximal.<ref name=\"Campion, A. 1998\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/A827241Z|title=Surface-enhanced Raman scattering|date=1998|last1=Campion|first1=Alan|last2=Kambhampati|first2=Patanjali|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=27|issue=4|pages=241 |citeseerx=<!-- 10.1.1.531.9985-->}}</ref>\n\nThe choice of surface metal is also dictated by the plasmon resonance frequency.

Specific [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP) can be identified using this technique. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating on the dye-labeled regions of DNA or RNA, allowing SERS to be performed. This has several potential applications: For example, Cao et al. report that gene sequences for HIV, Ebola, Hepatitis, and Bacillus Anthracis can be uniquely identified using this technique. Each spectrum was specific, which is advantageous over fluorescence detection; some fluorescent markers overlap and interfere with other gene markers. The advantage of this technique to identify gene sequences is that several Raman dyes are commercially available, which could lead to the development of non-overlapping probes for gene detection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.297.5586.1536|title=Nanoparticles with Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprints for DNA and RNA Detection|date=2002|last1=Cao|first1=Y.

While the spectra of most SERS experiments are similar to the non-surface enhanced spectra, there are often differences in the number of modes present. Additional modes not found in the traditional Raman spectrum can be present in the SERS spectrum, while other modes can disappear. The modes observed in any spectroscopic experiment are dictated by the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the molecules and are usually summarized by [[Selection rule]]s. When molecules are adsorbed to a surface, the symmetry of the system can change, slightly modifying the symmetry of the molecule, which can lead to differences in mode selection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150667a013|title=Surface selection rules for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy: calculations and application to the surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of phthalazine on silver|date=1984|last1=Moskovits|first1=M.|last2=Suh|first2=J. S.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|issue=23|pages=5526\u20135530}}</ref>\n\nOne common way in which selection rules are modified arises from the fact that many molecules that have a [[center of symmetry]] lose that feature when adsorbed to a surface. The loss of a center of symmetry eliminates the requirements of the [[Rule of mutual exclusion|mutual exclusion rule]], which dictates that modes can only be either Raman or infrared active. Thus modes that would normally appear only in the [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrum]] of the free molecule can appear in the SERS spectrum.<ref name=\"Smith2005\"/>\n\nA molecule's symmetry can be changed in different ways depending on the orientation in which the molecule is attached to the surface. In some experiments, it is possible to determine the orientation of adsorption to the surface from the SERS spectrum, as different modes will be present depending on how the symmetry is modified.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(03)00215-8|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~agbrolo/JECau111bipy.pdf|title=The orientation of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine adsorbed at a SERS-active Au(111) electrode surface|date=2003|last1=Brolo|first1=A.G.|last2=Jiang|first2=Z.|last3=Irish|first3=D.E.|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=547|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Raman spectroscopy}}\n\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n[[Category:Raman scattering]]\n[[Category:Raman spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Plasmonics]]\n", "name_user": "Mbloore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications:typo fix.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy"}

Unlike other concentration camps, it was located in a remote area, in the [[Fichtel Mountains]] of [[Bavaria]], adjacent to the town of [[Flossenb\u00fcrg]] and near the German border with [[Czechoslovakia]]. The camp's initial purpose was to exploit the forced labor of prisoners for the production of granite for [[Nazi architecture]]. In 1943, the bulk of prisoners switched to producing [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter planes and other armaments for [[World War II|Germany's war effort]]. Although originally intended for \"criminal\" and \"asocial\" prisoners, after [[Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union]], the camp's numbers swelled with political prisoners from Eastern Europe. It also developed an extensive [[Subcamps of Flossenb\u00fcrg|subcamp system]] that eventually outgrew the main camp.\n\nBefore it was liberated by the [[United States Army]] in April 1945, 89,964 to 100,000 prisoners passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps. Around 30,000 died from malnutrition, overwork, executions, or during the [[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]]. Some of those responsible for these deaths, including administrators, guards, and others, were tried and convicted in the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg trial]]. The camp was repurposed for other uses before the opening of a memorial and museum in 2007.\n\n==Background ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins (\"Germania\").jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albert Speer]]'s [[Germania (city)|plan for Berlin]]]]\nDuring the first half of 1938, the [[Nazi concentration camp]] population expanded threefold due to increased arrests by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) of individuals deemed undesirable, especially \"[[Black triangle (badge)|asocial]]\"{{efn|The asocial category was for people who did not \"fit into the mythical national community\", in the words of historian [[Nikolaus Wachsmann]].{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=252}} Nazi raids targeted homeless people and the mentally ill, as well as the unemployed.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=253\u2013254}}}} and \"criminal\"{{efn|According to SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]], the \"criminal\" prisoners at concentration camps needed to be isolated from society because they had committed offenses of a sexual or violent nature.

To build additional barracks, terraces had to be cut into the hillsides, an arduous task that led to many injuries.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=20}}\n\nFifty-five prisoners died before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=297}} During mid-1939, Nazi authorities planned to [[German invasion of Poland|invade Poland]]. It was decided to stage  [[false flag]] attacks in order to justify a German declaration of war. Several prisoners from Flossenb\u00fcrg and other concentration camps were secretly transferred to a [[Gestapo]] prison in [[Breslau]], poisoned, and dressed in Polish uniforms. On 31 August 1939, the bodies were [[Hochlinden incident|dumped at a border post in Hochlinden]] where they were shot and hacked; photographs were taken as \"proof\" of a Polish attack on Germany.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Flossenb\u00fcrg by Stefan Kryszak - Plan without legend.jpg|thumb|left|Layout of the camp, as drawn by survivor Stefan Kryszak|upright=1.2]]\n\nIn September 1939, the SS transferred 1,000 [[political prisoner]]s to Flossenb\u00fcrg from [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] in order to clear the latter camp to train the first regiment of the [[Waffen-SS]]. These prisoners, who were the first political prisoners at Flossenb\u00fcrg, were moved back to Dachau in March 1940.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=346}}{{sfn|Huebner|2009|pp=560\u2013561}} The first foreign prisoners were transferred to the camp by the Gestapo in April, including Czech student protestors and Polish resistance members. The vast majority of the new foreign prisoners were incarcerated due to their opposition to the Nazi regime; a few of them were Jews. Most of the Jewish political prisoners were executed or died shortly after arriving from mistreatment.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=25}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} The last twelve surviving Jews were deported to Auschwitz on 19 October 1942, pursuant to Himmler's order to make the Reich ''[[Judenrein]]''.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}}\n\nThe number of Polish prisoners increased sharply in 1941; on 23 January, 600 arrived from Auschwitz.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=27}} In mid-October 1941, 1,700{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=504}} to 2,000{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Flossenb\u00fcrg as part of a massive transfer of Soviet prisoners to the SS camp system. In poor condition due to their [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|previous mistreatment]], they spent several months recovering before they were deemed fit to work. They were accommodated in a special, cordoned-off area.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=497, 504}}\n\nBy February 1943, Flossenb\u00fcrg had 4,004 prisoners, not including the Soviet prisoners of war.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} From April 1943, the commandant was [[Max Koegel]], described by American historian Todd Huebner as \"a vicious martinet\" who lacked the ability to manage the camp during its rapid expansion.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Continuing influxes of political prisoners from occupied countries caused Germans to become a minority that same year.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} During 1944, Flossenb\u00fcrg's population expanded almost eightfold, from 4,869 to 40,437,{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=809}} due to a high influx of mainly non-German prisoners.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} This was part of an expansion that applied over the entire Nazi concentration camp system.{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=31}}\n\nBy the end of 1943, the number of guards had increased to about 450, including 140 [[Trawniki men|Ukrainian auxiliaries]]. As with other concentration camps, guards initially consisted of SS men from Germany and Austria, whose ranks were augmented with ''Volksdeutsche'' recruits after 1942. The number of guards increased sixfold during 1944 and reached 4,500 by the time the camp was evacuated. Due to manpower shortages, fit young guards were called up for front-line service and many older men, members of the Wehrmacht, and five hundred SS women were recruited into the guard force at Flossenb\u00fcrg.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}}\n\n===Subcamps===\n{{main|List of subcamps of Flossenb\u00fcrg}}\n{| <!-- Template:Collapse --> class=\"mw-collapsible {{#switch:{{lc:no}}|uncollapse|uncollapsed|expand|expanded|yes|y=mw-uncollapsed|#default=mw-collapsed}} \" style=\"background-color: transparent; text-align: left; border: 1px solid silver; margin:0.2em 0 0.2em 0.5em; width:17em; float: right; clear: right; padding: 1px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F0F2F5; font-size:87%; padding:0.2em 0.3em; text-align: left; \" | <span style=\"font-size: 115%;\">Map of selected subcamps</span>\n|-\n| style=\"border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;\" |\n<div>{{Location map many | Germany\n| width = 300\n| caption = \n| relief = 1\n|label4=Flossenb\u00fcrg|position4=right|coordinates4={{coord|49|44|08|N|12|21|21|E}} \n|label1=Leitmeritz|position1=bottom|coordinates1={{coord|50|32|3|N|14|7|58|E}}\n|label2=Hersbruck|position2=left|coordinates2={{coord|49|30|29|N|11|25|58|E}}\n|label3=Stulln|position3=bottom|coordinates3={{coord|49|25|N|12|8|E}}\n|label5=Johanngeorgenstadt|position5=left|coordinates5={{coord|50|26|00|N|12|42|50|E}}\n|label6=M\u00fclsen-St. Micheln|position6=top|coordinates6={{coord|50|44|41|N|12|34|29|E}}\n|label7=Freiberg|position7=right|coordinates7={{coord|50|54|43|N|13|20|34|E}}\n}}</div>\n|}\nThe expansion of the camp led to the establishment of subcamps, the first of which was established at [[Stulln]] in February 1942 to provide forced labor to a mining company. Many of them were located in the [[Sudetenland]] or across the border in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. Initially, the subcamps were not involved in armaments production, which changed in the second half of 1944 due to a large influx of available prisoners and the activities of the ''[[J\u00e4gerstab]]'', which sought to increase German aircraft production.{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=567}} The ''J\u00e4gerstab'''s dispersal of aircraft production spurred the expansion of the subcamp system in 1944{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} and resulted in the establishment of the two largest of the subcamps, at [[Hersbruck concentration camp|Hersbruck]] and [[Leitmeritz concentration camp|Leitmeritz]].{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=567}} In the second half of 1944, 45 new camps were created, compared to three camps in the previous six months.

Those who failed to advance were sent to work in the quarries, while those whose productivity improved were given cigarettes and extra food. The stone that they cut was used for construction of the camp, the ''[[Autobahn]]'', and various SS military projects,{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=75}} but later on it was destined for the monumental [[German Stadium]] project and the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]].{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|pp=41, 69, 75}}\n\nOf the five prewar concentration camps where economic industries were prominent, Flossenb\u00fcrg was the one that was most significant and consistent in producing income for DEST. For example, it produced {{convert|2898|m3}} of stone in 1939, almost three-quarters of the total production that year.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=41}}  The largest buyer of Flossenb\u00fcrg granite was Albert Speer's office for the reconstruction of Berlin.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=1}} Within this project the largest and most significant orders were for [[Wilhelm Kreis]]' [[Soldiers' Hall]] (''Soldatenhalle'') project, beginning in 1940.

Under the terms of the deal, Messerschmitt would provide skilled technicians, raw materials, and tools, paying DEST 3 Reichsmarks per day for a skilled laborer and 1.5 Reichsmarks per day for an unskilled prisoner. Thus, Messerschmitt could increase its profit margin by reducing labor cost, while DEST could reduce its administrative costs by acting as a manpower agency. In mid-January 1943, DEST accepted the offer;{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=180}} production started in early February.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=562}}\n\nAccording to [[Yad Vashem]] historian [[Daniel Uziel]], the conversion of Flossenb\u00fcrg to armaments production was especially significant because it had been the most profitable DEST enterprise. The number of prisoners working for Messerschmitt increased greatly after the [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|bombing of Messerschmitt's Regensburg plant]] on 17 August 1943.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|pp=56, 180}} That month, 800 prisoners worked for Messerschmitt; a year later, 5,700 prisoners were employed in armaments production.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=562}} {{ill|Erla Maschinenwerk|de}}, a subcontractor of Messerschmitt, established Flossenb\u00fcrg subcamps to support its production: a subcamp at [[Johanngeorgenstadt]], established in December 1943, to produce [[tailplane]]s for the Bf 109, and another subcamp at [[M\u00fclsen|M\u00fclsen-St. Micheln]] which produced aircraft wings, in January 1944.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} Despite strict regulations forbidding contact, the German civilian workers came into contact with prisoners and some helped by providing extra food or other assistance.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=222}}\n\nThe Flossenb\u00fcrg camp system had become a key supplier of Bf 109 parts by February 1944, when Messerschmitt's Regensburg plant was bombed again during \"[[Big Week]]\". Seven hundred Soviet prisoners who had been working at the Regensburg factory were transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg to continue working on Bf 109 production. Increased production at Flossenb\u00fcrg was essential to restoring production in the aftermath of the attack. Aircraft manufacturer [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] eventually became one of the primary users of slave labor at the subcamps for the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet bomber project, at [[Freiberg]] among other locations.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} Other prisoners in the subcamps were forced to work on [[synthetic oil]] production or repairing railways.{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=568}} Before the end of the war, about 18,000 prisoners at Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps were working on aviation-related projects.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=185}}\n\n==Conditions==\n[[File:Barracks at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp.jpg|thumb|Barracks at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]]\nTen percent of the deaths at Flossenb\u00fcrg occurred before 1943. The quarries caused the death rate to be higher at Flossenb\u00fcrg than at camps with less physically demanding industries, such as brickworks; the switch to armaments production in 1943 led to a decrease in the death rate.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=45}} Prisoners also suffered from a shortage of fresh water, due to the elevation, and unusually cold and wet weather; their clothing was not adequate for these conditions. The main camp, situated in a narrow valley, had little room for expansion. Originally constructed for only 1,500 prisoners, the population of the main camp increased to between 10,000{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} and 11,000{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} before it was evacuated in April 1945. In order to increase productivity, the prisoners were forced to sleep and work in shifts. This also helped alleviate the chronic overcrowding in the barracks.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}\n\nThe prisoner functionaries at Flossenb\u00fcrg were unusually brutal and corrupt, because the positions had been taken by criminal prisoners even though overall only about 5% of prisoners had been classified as criminal. The final camp elder, [[Anton Uhl]], was beaten to death by prisoners after liberation. Many of the criminal functionaries sexually abused young male prisoners, causing the commandant to isolate teenage boys in a separate barracks. The SS hierarchy was also known for corruption and brutality. Prisoners were mistreated in various ways, from being beaten or doused with cold water to being [[Postenpflicht|shot by guards]] during alleged escape attempts.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|pp=562\u2013563}}\n\nThe prisoners were chronically undernourished and disease was rampant.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Conditions differed based on a prisoner's status and race. Polish and Soviet prisoners occupied the lowest rungs on the prisoner hierarchy, being put on the most physically demanding work details and allocated less food than other prisoners.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=27}} There was an epidemic of dysentery in January 1940 that shut down work at the camp, and typhus epidemics in September 1944 and January 1945 claimed many lives.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} The total number of prisoners who passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps has been estimated at 89,964{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} or over 100,000.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} About 30,000 of the prisoners died at Flossenb\u00fcrg or during its evacuation,{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} the main causes of death were malnutrition and disease.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Between 13,000 and 15,000 prisoners died at the main camp and more than 10,000 at the satellite camps.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} An estimated three-quarters of the deaths occurred in the nine months before liberation.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=564}}\n\n==Executions==\n[[File:Flossenburg crematorium (external view).jpg|thumb|left|The Flossenb\u00fcrg crematorium]]\nDue to increasing mortality from the harsh conditions, the SS ordered the construction of an on-site crematorium, which was completed in May 1940.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=24}} Executions by shooting began at Flossenb\u00fcrg on 6 February 1941; the first victims were Polish political prisoners. Victims were separated after evening roll call and read their sentence. After a night in the camp jail, they were shot at the firing range adjacent to the crematorium. After a mass execution of 80 Polish prisoners on 8 September,{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|pp=27\u201328}} the execution method was changed to [[lethal injection]] due to complaints from local residents of blood and body parts washing up in nearby streams.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=476\u2013477}} The primary victims were Polish political prisoners and Soviet prisoners of war.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}}\n\nDoctors who had participated in the ''[[Aktion T4]]'' mass killings toured several concentration camps to select ill inmates to be transported to euthanasia centers; they visited Flossenb\u00fcrg in March 1942.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=440}} Thousands of prisoners who were worn out by forced labor were sent to [[death camps]] such as [[Majdanek]]{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=49}} and [[Auschwitz]].

Unlike other concentration camps it was located in a remote area, in the [[Fichtel Mountains]] of [[Bavaria]], adjacent to the town of [[Flossenb\u00fcrg]]  and near the German border with [[Czechoslovakia]]. The camp's initial purpose was to exploit the forced labor of prisoners for the production of granite for [[Nazi architecture]]. In 1943, the bulk of prisoners switched to producing [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter planes and other armaments for [[World War II|Germany's war effort]]. Although originally intended for \"criminal\" and \"asocial\" prisoners, after [[Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union]], the camp's numbers swelled with political prisoners from Eastern Europe. It also developed an extensive [[Subcamps of Flossenb\u00fcrg|subcamp system]] that eventually outgrew the main camp.\n\nBefore it was liberated by the [[United States Army]] in April 1945, 89,964 to 100,000 prisoners passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps. Around 30,000 people died there, from malnutrition, overwork, or executions, or during the [[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]]. Some of the perpetrators were convicted in the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg trial]], and the camp was repurposed for other uses before the opening of a memorial and museum in 2007.\n\n==Background ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins (\"Germania\").jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albert Speer]]'s [[Germania (city)|plan for Berlin]]]]\nDuring the first half of 1938, the [[Nazi concentration camp]] population expanded threefold due to increased arrests by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) of individuals deemed undesirable, especially \"[[Black triangle (badge)|asocial]]\"{{efn|The asocial category was for people who did not \"fit into the mythical national community\", in the words of historian [[Nikolaus Wachsmann]].{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=252}} Nazi raids targeted homeless people and the mentally ill, as well as the unemployed.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=253\u2013254}}}} and \"criminal\"{{efn|According to SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]], the \"criminal\" prisoners at concentration camps needed to be isolated from society because they had committed offenses of a sexual or violent nature.

The local economy, especially the stone industry, was negatively impacted by the new border with [[Czechoslovakia]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Weimar Republic#Decline|1930s economic slump]].

Simultaneously, hundreds of prisoners had to work in the quarries.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=296}} The camp's population had increased to 1,500 following arrivals from Dachau, [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], and [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=560}} In January 1939, the first commandant, [[Jakob Weiseborn]], unexpectedly died.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=214}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=38}} He was replaced by a former SS officer at Dachau, [[Karl K\u00fcnstler]], who presided over an era in which the camp became an economically productive center for granite quarrying,{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=38}} and increasingly deadly for its prisoners.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=214}} With the first barracks complete,  in 1939 work began on an internal jail, guard towers, a washing facility, and a sewer system.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} In April 1939, the economic productivity of the camp led to Pohl ordering the camp to be expanded to fit 3,000 prisoners. To build additional barracks, terraces had to be cut into the hillsides, an arduous task that led to many injuries.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=20}}\n\nFifty-five prisoners died before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=297}} During mid-1939, Nazi authorities planned to [[German invasion of Poland|invade Poland]]. It was decided to stage  [[false flag]] attacks in order to justify a German declaration of war. Several prisoners from Flossenb\u00fcrg and other concentration camps were secretly transferred to a [[Gestapo]] prison in [[Breslau]], poisoned, and dressed in Polish uniforms. On 31 August 1939, the bodies were [[Hochlinden incident|dumped at a border post in Hochlinden]] where they were shot and hacked; photographs were taken as \"proof\" of a Polish attack on Germany.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Flossenb\u00fcrg by Stefan Kryszak - Plan without legend.jpg|thumb|left|Layout of the camp, as drawn by survivor Stefan Kryszak|upright=1.2]]\n\nIn September 1939, the SS transferred 1,000 [[political prisoner]]s to Flossenb\u00fcrg from [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] in order to clear the latter camp to train the first regiment of the [[Waffen-SS]]. These prisoners, who were the first political prisoners at Flossenb\u00fcrg, were moved back to Dachau in March 1940.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=346}}{{sfn|Huebner|2009|pp=560\u2013561}} The first foreign prisoners were transferred to the camp by the Gestapo in April, including Czech student protestors and Polish resistance members. The vast majority of the new foreign prisoners were incarcerated due to their opposition to the Nazi regime; a few of them were Jews. Most of the Jewish political prisoners were executed or died shortly after arriving from mistreatment.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=25}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} The last twelve surviving Jews were deported to Auschwitz on 19 October 1942, pursuant to Himmler's order to make the Reich ''[[Judenrein]]''.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}}\n\nThe number of Polish prisoners increased sharply in 1941; on 23 January, 600 arrived from Auschwitz.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=27}} In mid-October 1941, 1,700{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=504}} to 2,000{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Flossenb\u00fcrg as part of a massive transfer of Soviet prisoners to the SS camp system. In poor condition due to their [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|previous mistreatment]], they spent several months recovering before they were deemed fit to work. They were accommodated in a special, cordoned-off area.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=497, 504}}\n\nBy February 1943, Flossenb\u00fcrg had 4,004 prisoners, not including the Soviet prisoners of war.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} From April 1943, the commandant was [[Max Koegel]], described by American historian Todd Huebner as \"a vicious martinet\" who lacked the ability to manage the camp during its rapid expansion.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Continuing influxes of political prisoners from occupied countries caused Germans to become a minority that same year.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} During 1944, Flossenb\u00fcrg's population expanded almost eightfold, from 4,869 to 40,437,{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=809}} due to a high influx of mainly non-German prisoners.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} This was part of an expansion that applied over the entire Nazi concentration camp system.{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=31}}\n\nBy the end of 1943, the number of guards had increased to about 450, including 140 [[Trawniki men|Ukrainian auxiliaries]]. As with other concentration camps, guards initially consisted of SS men from Germany and Austria, whose ranks were augmented with ''Volksdeutsche'' recruits after 1942. The number of guards increased sixfold during 1944 and reached 4,500 by the time the camp was evacuated. Due to manpower shortages, fit young guards were called up for front-line service and many older men, members of the Wehrmacht, and five hundred SS women were recruited into the guard force at Flossenb\u00fcrg.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}}\n\n===Subcamps===\n{{main|List of subcamps of Flossenb\u00fcrg}}\n{| <!-- Template:Collapse --> class=\"mw-collapsible {{#switch:{{lc:no}}|uncollapse|uncollapsed|expand|expanded|yes|y=mw-uncollapsed|#default=mw-collapsed}} \" style=\"background-color: transparent; text-align: left; border: 1px solid silver; margin:0.2em 0 0.2em 0.5em; width:17em; float: right; clear: right; padding: 1px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F0F2F5; font-size:87%; padding:0.2em 0.3em; text-align: left; \" | <span style=\"font-size: 115%;\">Map of selected subcamps</span>\n|-\n| style=\"border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;\" |\n<div>{{Location map many | Germany\n| width = 300\n| caption = \n| relief = 1\n|label4=Flossenb\u00fcrg|position4=right|coordinates4={{coord|49|44|08|N|12|21|21|E}} \n|label1=Leitmeritz|position1=bottom|coordinates1={{coord|50|32|3|N|14|7|58|E}}\n|label2=Hersbruck|position2=left|coordinates2={{coord|49|30|29|N|11|25|58|E}}\n|label3=Stulln|position3=bottom|coordinates3={{coord|49|25|N|12|8|E}}\n|label5=Johanngeorgenstadt|position5=left|coordinates5={{coord|50|26|00|N|12|42|50|E}}\n|label6=M\u00fclsen-St. Micheln|position6=top|coordinates6={{coord|50|44|41|N|12|34|29|E}}\n|label7=Freiberg|position7=right|coordinates7={{coord|50|54|43|N|13|20|34|E}}\n}}</div>\n|}\nThe expansion of the camp led to the establishment of subcamps, the first of which was established at [[Stulln]] in February 1942 to provide forced labor to a mining company. Many of them were located in the [[Sudetenland]] or across the border in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. Initially, the subcamps were not involved in armaments production, which changed in the second half of 1944 due to a large influx of available prisoners and the activities of the ''[[J\u00e4gerstab]]'', which sought to increase German aircraft production.{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=567}} The ''J\u00e4gerstab'''s dispersal of aircraft production spurred the expansion of the subcamp system in 1944{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} and resulted in the establishment of the two largest of the subcamps, at [[Hersbruck concentration camp|Hersbruck]] and [[Leitmeritz concentration camp|Leitmeritz]].{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=567}} In the second half of 1944, 45 new camps were created, compared to three camps in the previous six months.

Those who failed to advance were sent to work in the quarries, while those whose productivity improved were given cigarettes and extra food. The stone that they cut was used for construction of the camp, the ''[[Autobahn]]'', and various SS military projects,{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=75}} but later on it was destined for the monumental [[German Stadium]] project and the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]].{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|pp=41, 69, 75}}\n\nOf the five prewar concentration camps where economic industries were prominent, Flossenb\u00fcrg was the one that was most significant and consistent in producing income for DEST. For example, it produced {{convert|2898|m3}} of stone in 1939, almost three-quarters of the total production that year.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=41}}  The largest buyer of Flossenb\u00fcrg granite was Albert Speer's office for the reconstruction of Berlin.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=1}} Within this project the largest and most significant orders were for [[Wilhelm Kreis]]' [[Soldiers' Hall]] (''Soldatenhalle'') project, beginning in 1940.

Under the terms of the deal, Messerschmitt would provide skilled technicians, raw materials, and tools, paying DEST 3 Reichsmarks per day for a skilled laborer and 1.5 Reichsmarks per day for an unskilled prisoner. Thus, Messerschmitt could increase its profit margin by reducing labor cost, while DEST could reduce its administrative costs by acting as a manpower agency. In mid-January 1943, DEST accepted the offer;{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=180}} production started in early February.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=562}}\n\nAccording to [[Yad Vashem]] historian [[Daniel Uziel]], the conversion of Flossenb\u00fcrg to armaments production was especially significant because it had been the most profitable DEST enterprise. The number of prisoners working for Messerschmitt increased greatly after the [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|bombing of Messerschmitt's Regensburg plant]] on 17 August 1943.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|pp=56, 180}} That month, 800 prisoners worked for Messerschmitt; a year later, 5,700 prisoners were employed in armaments production.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=562}} {{ill|Erla Maschinenwerk|de}}, a subcontractor of Messerschmitt, established Flossenb\u00fcrg subcamps to support its production: a subcamp at [[Johanngeorgenstadt]], established in December 1943, to produce [[tailplane]]s for the Bf 109, and another subcamp at [[M\u00fclsen|M\u00fclsen-St. Micheln]] which produced aircraft wings, in January 1944.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} Despite strict regulations forbidding contact, the German civilian workers came into contact with prisoners and some helped by providing extra food or other assistance.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=222}}\n\nThe Flossenb\u00fcrg camp system had become a key supplier of Bf 109 parts by February 1944, when Messerschmitt's Regensburg plant was bombed again during \"[[Big Week]]\". Seven hundred Soviet prisoners who had been working at the Regensburg factory were transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg to continue working on Bf 109 production. Increased production at Flossenb\u00fcrg was essential to restoring production in the aftermath of the attack. Aircraft manufacturer [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] eventually became one of the primary users of slave labor at the subcamps for the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet bomber project, at [[Freiberg]] among other locations.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=182}} Other prisoners in the subcamps were forced to work on [[synthetic oil]] production or repairing railways.{{sfn|Fritz|2009|p=568}} Before the end of the war, about 18,000 prisoners at Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps were working on aviation-related projects.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=185}}\n\n==Conditions==\n[[File:Barracks at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp.jpg|thumb|Barracks at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]]\nTen percent of the deaths at Flossenb\u00fcrg occurred before 1943. The quarries caused the death rate to be higher at Flossenb\u00fcrg than at camps with less physically demanding industries, such as brickworks; the switch to armaments production in 1943 led to a decrease in the death rate.{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=45}} Prisoners also suffered from a shortage of fresh water, due to the elevation, and unusually cold and wet weather; their clothing was not adequate for these conditions. The main camp, situated in a narrow valley, had little room for expansion. Originally constructed for only 1,500 prisoners, the population of the main camp increased to between 10,000{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} and 11,000{{sfn|Jaskot|2002|p=40}} before it was evacuated in April 1945. In order to increase productivity, the prisoners were forced to sleep and work in shifts. This also helped alleviate the chronic overcrowding in the barracks.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}\n\nThe prisoner functionaries at Flossenb\u00fcrg were unusually brutal and corrupt, because the positions had been taken by criminal prisoners even though overall only about 5% of prisoners had been classified as criminal. The final camp elder, [[Anton Uhl]], was beaten to death by prisoners after liberation. Many of the criminal functionaries sexually abused young male prisoners, causing the commandant to isolate teenage boys in a separate barracks. The SS hierarchy was also known for corruption and brutality. Prisoners were mistreated in various ways, from being beaten or doused with cold water to being [[Postenpflicht|shot by guards]] during alleged escape attempts.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|pp=562\u2013563}}\n\nThe prisoners were chronically undernourished and disease was rampant.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Conditions differed based on a prisoner's status and race. Polish and Soviet prisoners occupied the lowest rungs on the prisoner hierarchy, being put on the most physically demanding work details and allocated less food than other prisoners.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=27}} There was an epidemic of dysentery in January 1940 that shut down work at the camp, and typhus epidemics in September 1944 and January 1945 claimed many lives.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} The total number of prisoners who passed through Flossenb\u00fcrg and its subcamps has been estimated at 89,964{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}} or over 100,000.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} About 30,000 of the prisoners died at Flossenb\u00fcrg or during its evacuation,{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=561}}{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} the main causes of death were malnutrition and disease.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}} Between 13,000 and 15,000 prisoners died at the main camp and more than 10,000 at the satellite camps.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=51}} An estimated three-quarters of the deaths occurred in the nine months before liberation.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=564}}\n\n==Executions==\n[[File:Flossenburg crematorium (external view).jpg|thumb|left|The Flossenb\u00fcrg crematorium]]\nDue to increasing mortality from the harsh conditions, the SS ordered the construction of an on-site crematorium, which was completed in May 1940.{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|p=24}} Executions by shooting began at Flossenb\u00fcrg on 6 February 1941; the first victims were Polish political prisoners. Victims were separated after evening roll call and read their sentence. After a night in the camp jail, they were shot at the firing range adjacent to the crematorium. After a mass execution of 80 Polish prisoners on 8 September,{{sfn|Skriebeleit|2007|pp=27\u201328}} the execution method was changed to [[lethal injection]] due to complaints from local residents of blood and body parts washing up in nearby streams.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=476\u2013477}} The primary victims were Polish political prisoners and Soviet prisoners of war.{{sfn|Huebner|2009|p=563}}\n\nDoctors who had participated in the ''[[Aktion T4]]'' mass killings toured several concentration camps to select ill inmates to be transported to euthanasia centers; they visited Flossenb\u00fcrg in March 1942.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=440}} Thousands of prisoners who were worn out by forced labor were sent to [[death camps]] such as [[Majdanek]]{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=49}} and [[Auschwitz]].

Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Social security in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]].

Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Social security in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]].

Cushioning for the rider was provided by the low-pressure hubless tires, which also provided a low-impact impression on the environments it traverses. <ref>{{cite web|author=NMCM |url= https://nationalmcmuseum.org/2017/09/22/1972-honda-atc90/ |title=1972 Honda ATC90(sic)|website=Nationalmcmuseum.org|date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> For all the benefits, the tires proved to be fragile in rougher terrain, and expensive to replace.

Development began in 1967, in response to requests from American dealers for products to sell in the motorcycle off-season. Takeuchi considered many variations before settling on a three-wheeled design with low-pressure ballon tires, driven by an enlarged [[Honda ST70]] engine, through a 4 Speed Dual-Range Semi automatic clutched transmission. <ref>{{cite web|author=ATC90.com |url= http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html |title=ATC90-History|website=ATC90.tripod.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==1st Generation US90 (1970-1973)==\n\nThe Initial US90 was offered at $595 in 1970, and featured an 89cc engine producing 7hp. The US90 designation was used until 1973, when Honda successfully trademarked the moniker \u2018All Terrain Cycle\u2019. <ref>{{cite web|author=Louis Mieike |url= http://www.3wheelerworld.com/content.php/216-US90-and-ATC90-Technical-Data |title=US90 and ATC90 technical data|website=Www.3wheelerworld.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> The designation was then changed to ATC90. The ATC prefix would be used for all Honda Three-Wheeled-Vehicles until production ceased in 1987, and become a universal epithet for other manufacturers three-wheeled machines.\n\n==2nd Generation ATC90 (1974-1978)==\n\nThe US90 had been designed without suspension, which would be common place on ATC\u2019s for the first decade. Cushioning for the rider was provided by the low-pressure hubless tires, which also provided a low-impact impression on the environments it traverses. <ref>{{cite web|author=NMCM |url= https://nationalmcmuseum.org/2017/09/22/1972-honda-atc90/ |title=1972 Honda ATC90(sic)|website=Nationalmcmuseum.org|date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> For all the benefits, the tires proved to be fragile in rougher terrain, and expensive to replace.

The series originated from [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]]'s desire to create a game that would tell the way of life of the [[yakuza]]. Nagoshi initially struggled to find a platform for the project, until [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] showed interest in the prospect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-24-yakuza-unlikely-on-xbox-360|title=Yakuza unlikely on Xbox 360|author=Martin Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe series primarily focuses on the yakuza [[Kazuma Kiryu]] from the Tojo Clan. While Kiryu often assists the Tojo Clan, the series has also featured him searching for another way of life in the form of raising orphans. The gameplay of ''Yakuza'' has the player controlling Kiryu (or another character depending on the title) in an open district where he can encounter an enemy or perform an activity in the city to obtain experience.\n\nThe franchise has become a commercial and critical success, and as of 2020, Sega has reported that the ''Yakuza'' franchise has sold a combined total of 12 million units in physical and digital sales since its debut in 2005.<ref name=\"SegaRPG2017\">[https://www.famitsu.com/news/201911/20187337.html Famitsu] 2019.11.20</ref> Strong sales of the games in its original Japanese market has led to the franchise's expansion to other media, including film adaptations.\n\n== Setting ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2017}}\nThe ''Yakuza'' games are primarily set in Kamurocho, a fictionalized version of the real life [[Kabukich\u014d, Tokyo|Kabukich\u014d]] district in [[Tokyo]]. Throughout the series, characters visit other areas of Japan, such as [[Osaka]] in ''Yakuza 2'', ''5'' and ''0'', [[Okinawa]] in ''Yakuza 3'', Nagasugai, part of the fictional [[Fukuoka]] based on [[Nakasu]], Tsukimino, part of the fictional [[Sapporo]] based on [[Susukino]] and Kin'eicho, part of the fictional [[Nagoya]] based on [[Sakae, Nagoya|Sakae]] in ''Yakuza 5'', and [[Hiroshima]] in ''Yakuza 6''. The districts and towns in the games correlate to the appearance of each in real life during the year each game comes out, often being renovated and remodeled in new entries. Stores and buildings are often different from their real life counterparts, replacing them with real-life product placements or plot-important locations.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAll ''Yakuza'' games feature three distinct yet connected modes called Event, Adventure and Battle. The main character randomly encounters foes on their path, triggering an Encounter Battle. In fights, the player character uses hand-to-hand combat, using skills such as Rush Combos, grabs, throws and Finishing Moves, and some games allow the player character to select from and use multiple fighting styles. Weapons and objects can also be wielded, though firearms are rare. Winning some of these battles can result in obtaining money or items which can be sold or used to purchase equipment or a variety of items in shops, gamble, or play mini-games. Encounter Battles caused by the story can end quicker by finishing the leader of the enemies, as well as by using powerful moves called Heat Actions, which require the filling of the 'Heat Gauge' to become usable. Some of these tend to include [[quick time event]]s. As the player character fights, they gain experience that can be used to increase their stats and become a stronger fighter. The newest installment in the series, ''Yakuza: Like a Dragon'', includes a new battle system where the player character recruits party members to fight alongside them in [[turn-based]] [[role-playing game]] battles against enemies, and to play alongside them in mini-games.\n\nThe series has a high number of entertaining sub-stories, which often complement the main story.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://levelskip.com/action-adventure/You-Will-Love-These-Yakuza-0-Substories |date=7 Jan 2019 |author=Kuan Leong Yong |accessdate=14 Mar 2019 |title=You'll love these Yakuza 0 Substories}}</ref> These give the player extra EXP. There are many mini-games, which range from activities like bowling, darts, and arcade games, to much more complex ones, like professions, which can take a number of hours over the course of several sessions to complete. Examples include:\n* Coliseum Fights: where the player fights in three-round mini championships against various opponents in different challenges to earn points which can be spent on unique items.\n* Weapon/gear crafting: the player needs to find various components and blueprints to produce powerful and varied gear and weapons.\n* Cabaret Club Management: the player runs a hostess club in three-minute sessions and tries to earn as much money as possible by matching up the right girl with the right client and quickly responding to their calls for help. They also take part in battles against other hostess clubs.\n* Pocket Circuit: a minigame where Pocket Circuit cars (like [[slot car]]s, but bounded by the car's lane and self-powered, similar to [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]'s [[Mini 4WD]] line of scale model cars) race against each other. In both ''Yakuza 0'' and ''Yakuza Kiwami'', there are several race series that take place and a number of side stories relating to this minigame.\n* Hostess/Cabaret Clubs: this involves talking to hostess girls to fill out their \"love\" gauge, as well as ordering the right food/drink, buying gifts and wearing the right accessories to please them as much as possible, until they can be taken out on a date. This was one of many aspects that was controversially cut from the western release of ''Yakuza 3'', leading to criticism of Sega for ignoring western gamers' desire to experience Japanese culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/sega-you-are-once-again-making-a-giant-mistake-5478862 |date=24 Feb 2010 |accessdate=14 Mar 2019 |author= Brian Ashcraft |title=Sega, You Are Once Again Making A Giant Mistake}}</ref> This content was restored in the remastered version. \n* [[Club Sega]]: a virtual recreation of the real-life Sega arcade chain that features activities such as [[UFO catcher]]s, darts, and playable emulations of classic Sega arcade titles such as ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'' and ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''.

The stories of the first two games in the series were supervised by novelist [[Hase Seishu]], a writer of [[crime fiction]]. The main story is presented in chapters, much like [[Kinji Fukasaku]]'s classic yakuza movie ''[[Sympathy for the Underdog]]'' and is expanded upon with around a hundred subplots per game. The depth this provides leads to the series having a large cast of characters, including many which recur in minor roles.\n\n==== ''Yakuza'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza (video game)}}\nThe first game follows the story of Kazuma Kiryu (\u6850\u751f \u4e00\u99ac Kiry\u016b Kazuma), a formerly promising ''yakuza'' who is released from a ten-year prison sentence in December 2005, having taken the fall for the murder of his family's patriarch to protect his sworn brother. The Tojo Clan he was once a member of has had \u00a510 billion (approximately US$100 million) stolen from their vault. The search for the money, undertaken by the entire Japanese underworld, results in Kiryu being forced back into the brutal, lawless world of the ''yakuza''. A mysterious young girl would lead Kiryu to the answers, if he can keep her alive.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 2'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 2}}\nIn 2006, Kazuma Kiryu has left his post as the Chairman of the Tojo Clan, Japan's most violent crime syndicate. When an all-out war erupts, Kiryu must return and uphold the honor of his former clan, with brutal clashes with rival gangs, the police, and the Korean mafia through the back alleys and neon-lit nightclubs of Tokyo and [[Osaka]].\n\n==== ''Yakuza 3'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 3}}\nIn March 2009, Kazuma Kiryu now runs the Morning Glory Orphanage in [[Okinawa]] where he raises nine children, including his surrogate daughter [[Haruka Sawamura]]. When an impending business deal threatens to tear down the orphanage, Kiryu travels from the beaches of Okinawa to the darkest side of Tokyo as he is pulled back to a life he thought he had left behind.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 4'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 4}}\nIn March 2010, Kazuma Kiryu is again involved in an incident in Kamurocho. First, a man is fatally shot on the turf of the powerful Tojo Clan. Then, a man investigating the murder is stabbed to death. These events spark a full-blown struggle for money, power, and above all, honor, in a story experienced through the eyes of four characters.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 5'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 5}}\nIn December 2012, the seventh chairman of the Omi Alliance is on his deathbed. His death would end the truce between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance, leading to a war between the clans. To prepare, the Tojo Clan is forced to strengthen their organization by aligning themselves with older clans based in other major cities across Japan to create a new organization, rivaling that of the Omi Alliance. This new alliance would breach the old traditional barriers of clan territories, leading Daigo Dojima to head for [[Fukuoka]].\n\n==== ''Yakuza 0'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 0}}\nIn December 1988, many years before the original ''Yakuza'', a young Kazuma Kiryu is framed for the murder of a civilian, leading him to be hunted by members of the Tojo clan. At the same time, Goro Majima finds himself protecting a helpless blind girl whom he was ordered to assassinate, making him a target himself. The two must each attempt to protect themselves and uncover the truth, including how both incidents are tied to the mysterious \"Empty Lot\".\n\n==== ''Yakuza 6'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 6}}\nIn 2016, after willingly spending three years in prison for his past crimes, Kazuma Kiryu is released only to discover that his adoptive daughter Haruka has disappeared, later found comatose and critically injured after a hit-and-run incident. A devastated Kiryu decides to travel to Onomichi Jingaicho in Hiroshima, hoping to find the truth behind what happened to Haruka.\n\n==== ''Yakuza: Like a Dragon'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza: Like a Dragon}}\nIn 2019, Ichiban Kasuga, a former member of the Tojo Clan's Arakawa Family who is released after 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, ends up in Yokohama after the police and the Omi Alliance join forces.\n\n=== Spin-offs ===\n==== ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'' ====\n{{main|Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!}}\nThe first ''Yakuza'' series spin-off, ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'' is set in Kyoto during the [[Edo period]], in 1605, and follows the life of legendary swordsman [[Miyamoto Musashi]].

It was released for [[PlayStation 4]] on {{date|2018-12-13|mdy}}, with a Western release following in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/project-judge-judge-eyes-yakuza-demo-preview|title=Project Judge Feels Like a Yakuza Spin-off All the Way Down to the Return of Kamurocho|publisher=US Gamer|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Rereleases and remakes ===\n==== ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku 1&2 HD Edition'' ====\n{{main|Yakuza (video game)#Legacy}}\nA high-definition remaster of the first two games in the series was released in Japan on {{date|2012-11-01|mdy}} for [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/07/yakuza-1-2-hd-ps3/|title= Yakuza 1 & 2 HD Edition Hits PlayStation 3 in November|author=Feit, Daniel|date=19 July 2012|newspaper=Wired|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> The high-definition remaster was ported to [[Wii U]] and released in Japan on {{date|2013-08-08|mdy}} under the title ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku 1&2 HD for Wii U''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vg247.com/2013/08/15/yakuza-1-2-hd-for-wii-u-bombing-hard-in-japan/|title=Yakuza 1+2 HD for Wii U bombing hard in Japan|author=Owen, Phil|date=15 August 2013|newspaper=VG 24/7|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/08/yakuza_1_and_2_hd_reportedly_sells_less_than_2000_copies_in_debut_week|title=Yakuza 1&2 HD Reportedly Sells Less Than 2000 Copies in Debut Week|author=Whitehead, Thomas|date=15 August 2013|newspaper=Nintendo Life|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> Both versions of the compilation were only released in Japan.\n\n==== ''Yakuza Kiwami'' ====\n{{main|Yakuza Kiwami}}\n''Yakuza Kiwami'', a remake of the first ''Yakuza'' game, was released in Japan on January 21, 2016 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]]; the PS4 version received a Western release in August 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/09/yakuza-kiwami-yakuza-6-announced-ps4|title=Yakuza: Kiwami and Yakuza 6 announced for PS4|author=Romano, Sal|newspaper=Gematsu|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> The two versions were the top two best-selling games in Japan during their release week, selling 103,256 copies for PlayStation 4 and 60,427 for PlayStation 3.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/117/G011794/20160127073/|script-title=ja:\u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u9031\u9593\u8ca9\u58f2\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0Top20 (\u96c6\u8a08\u671f\u9593\uff1a2016\u5e741\u670818\u65e5\uff5e1\u670824\u65e5)|trans-title=Consumer software weekly sales ranking Top20 (January 18 to January 24, 2016)|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|newspaper=4gamer|date=27 January 2016|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> The game was later released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on February 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/834530/Yakuza_Kiwami/ |title=Yakuza Kiwami on Steam |accessdate=23 Feb 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Yakuza Kiwami 2'' ====\n{{main|Yakuza Kiwami 2}}\n''Yakuza Kiwami 2'', a remake of ''Yakuza 2'', was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on December 7, 2017 in Japan, and in North America and Europe on August 28, 2018.

Seishu had been a video game player since the days of ''[[Space Invaders]]'', but over the past four or five years he had lost interest, as he was less concerned with 3D visuals and gameplay than he was with story. ''Yakuza'' caught his attention though, and he decided to accept the project even though it came at the busiest point of his professional writing career. Nagoshi wanted players to get enjoyment from merely walking through Kamurocho. Touching upon the game's name, Nagoshi revealed that it was his concoction. The original Japanese name ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku'' translates to \"Like a Dragon\", as Nagoshi felt that dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|title=Ryu Ga Gotoku Update|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{multiple image\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Yakuzakiwami2donquijote.jpg\n | alt1 = Don Quijote in real life\n | image2 =Donquijoteshinjukucropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Don Quijote in ''Yakuza''\n | footer = The [[Don Quijote (store)|Don Quijote]] store in Kamurocho (left), and its real-life equivalent in [[Kabukich\u014d]].

An example of this is the [[Don Quijote (store)|Don Quijote]] discount store, whose in-game stores are based on the stores in the equivalent real-life districts. This strategy allows to support the game's costly production and at the same time gives a realistic aspect to the environments which are based on real locations in Tokyo, [[Osaka]] and [[Naha]]. In promoting the game, Sega hired [[Takashi Miike]], who directed the live-action ''[[Like a Dragon]]'' film. There were no problems in doing this due to a member from the team who was originally from the film industry who worked with [[Toei Company]] on V-cinema.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Sega went to a lot of companies to try to get brands into the game, like car companies and fashion companies, but because of the nature of the ''Yakuza'' game, they were turned down by most of them.{{cn|date=September 2019}} However, the company Suntory accepted them. Suntory wanted to sell whiskey, and they felt the game's demographic and the whiskey-drinking demographic would mesh nicely.<ref name=\"page3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|title=A Heart-To-Heart With Yakuza's Development Team|publisher=1UP.com|page=3|date=October 9, 2008|author=Gifford, Kevin|accessdate=March 28, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701161732/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|archivedate=July 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Clr}}\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n[[File:Ryu ga gotoku 3 GTMF2009 slideshow15.jpg|thumb|A ''Yakuza 3'' Event Mode minor character's face is being modeled in 3D through [[Softimage|Softimage XSI 6.5]] and during 3D scan the actor wore a [[swim cap]] because his character wears a police [[peaked cap]]<ref name=\"HPworkstation\"/>]]\nThe game's original voice actors are Japanese celebrities which can be voice actors, singers, ''[[tarento]]'', film or TV series actors, radio or television [[Celebrity|celebrities]]. Cabaret girls and alike characters have featured models, [[gravure idol]]s and adult actresses as voice actresses and likenesses. Since the 2008 spin-off ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'', the game series' main characters have their face modeled in 3D after their voice actors. As in the [[Virtua Fighter (series)|''Virtua Fighter'' series]], Western main and minor characters do not speak in Japanese, but rather in English. Minor Chinese and Korean characters also often speak their native tongues.\n\nThe first game in the series to be released to the United States and PAL regions was dubbed in English. However, due to criticism of the English voice acting, each subsequent Western release has retained the original Japanese voice acting. Later spinoff titles such as ''Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise'' and ''Judgment'' have featured dual language voiceover support.\n\nThe [[PlayStation 3]] installments' realistic [[Character creation|character design]] is based on [[Cyberware Inc.|Cyberware]] [[3D scanner]], [[Softimage XSI|Softimage XSI 6.5]] 3D models<ref name=\"HPworkstation\">{{cite web|title=HP Workstation \u5c0e\u5165\u4e8b\u4f8b\u7d39\u4ecb\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac \u300c\u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f3\u300d|author=Hewlett-Packard Japan|publisher=Hewlett-Packard|url=http://h50146.www5.hp.com/products/workstations/personal_ws/case_studies/sega_ryugagotoku.html|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> and Sega's [[Magical V-Engine]].\n\n=== Localization changes ===\nWhen the series was [[Internationalization and localization|internationalized and localized]] to fit the Western market several changes occurred. These include changing the title of the game (''Like a Dragon'' \u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f, ''ry\u016b ga gotoku'' became ''Yakuza'') and the names of several characters (Shintaro Kazama is Shintaro Fuma, Akira Nishikiyama is Akira Nishiki, Futoshi Shimano is Futo Shimano, Sai no Hanaya is Kage).\n\n''Yakuza 4'' adjusted several of these localisation changes, following criticism of the previous games, and in particular the content excised from the Western release of ''Yakuza 3''. Producer Noguchi noted that there was an attempt to \"bring a more complete localization that was more faithful to the source material\". This included reversing several name changes. In addition, some conventions were changed; in previous Western localisations, protagonist Kazuma Kiryu had been referred to primarily by his first name. In ''Yakuza 4'', he is referred to primarily by his family name, Kiryu, which more closely reflects the original dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|title=Yakuza 4 Producer on Re-Localising the Series|date=2011-03-13|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Yakuza (video game) #Soundtrack|Yakuza 2#Soundtrack|Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!#Soundtrack|Yakuza 3#Soundtrack}}\nThe three ''Yakuza'' original soundtrack albums are composed by [[Hidenori Shoji]], [[Hideki Sakamoto]] ''et alii'' and are published by [[Wave Master]].

This color book was a [[monography]] dedicated to the game with [[Reina (Yakuza series)|Mai]], a sub-scenario female character, as the [[cover girl]]. This character's physical aspect was inspired by its voice actor, [[Mihiro]], a Japanese [[AV idol|adult video idol]] acting in porno films. Each new game release coincides with a new ''Kamutai Magazine'' issue featuring a voice actress as cover girl. Hence this December 2005 issue was followed by a December 2006 issue (cover girl is Japanese porn star [[Nana Natsume]]), a March 2008 issue (cover girl is Taiwanese porn star [[Yinling of Joytoy]]) and a February 2009 issue (cover girls are Shizuka Mutou, [[Sayaka Araki]] and Rina Sakurai). The fifth issue was bundled with ''Ryu Ga Gotoku 4'' and released in March 2010.\n\n=== Original video ===\n{{main|Like a Dragon: Prologue}}\nTakeshi Miyasaka directed an [[Direct-to-video|original video]] during the promotion period for the western release of the game which depicted Kazuma, Nishiki and Yumi growing up at the Sunflower Orphanage and leaving for Tokyo.

The series originated from [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]]'s desire to create a game that would tell the way of life of the [[yakuza]]. Nagoshi initially struggled to find a platform for the project, until [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] showed interest in the prospect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-24-yakuza-unlikely-on-xbox-360|title=Yakuza unlikely on Xbox 360|author=Martin Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe series primarily focuses on the yakuza [[Kazuma Kiryu]] from the Tojo Clan. While Kiryu often assists the Tojo Clan, the series has also featured him searching for another way of life in the form of raising orphans. The gameplay of ''Yakuza'' has the player controlling Kiryu (or another character depending on the title) in an open district where he can encounter an enemy or perform an activity in the city to obtain experience.\n\nThe franchise has become a commercial and critical success, and as of 2020, Sega has reported that the ''Yakuza'' franchise has sold a combined total of 12 million units in physical and digital sales since its debut in 2005.<ref name=\"SegaRPG2017\">[https://www.famitsu.com/news/201911/20187337.html Famitsu] 2019.11.20</ref> Strong sales of the games in its original Japanese market has led to the franchise's expansion to other media, including film adaptations.\n\n== Setting ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2017}}\nThe ''Yakuza'' games are primarily set in Kamurocho, a fictionalized version of the real life [[Kabukich\u014d, Tokyo|Kabukich\u014d]] district in [[Tokyo]]. Throughout the series, characters visit other areas of Japan, such as [[Osaka]] in ''Yakuza 2'', ''5'' and ''0'', [[Okinawa]] in ''Yakuza 3'', Nagasugai, part of the fictional [[Fukuoka]] based on [[Nakasu]], Tsukimino, part of the fictional [[Sapporo]] based on [[Susukino]] and Kin'eicho, part of the fictional [[Nagoya]] based on [[Sakae, Nagoya|Sakae]] in ''Yakuza 5'', and [[Hiroshima]] in ''Yakuza 6''. The districts and towns in the games correlate to the appearance of each in real life during the year each game comes out, often being renovated and remodeled in new entries. Stores and buildings are often different from their real life counterparts, replacing them with real-life product placements or plot-important locations.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAll ''Yakuza'' games feature three distinct yet connected modes called Event, Adventure and Battle. The main character randomly encounters foes on their path, triggering an Encounter Battle. In fights, the player character uses hand-to-hand combat, using skills such as Rush Combos, grabs, throws and Finishing Moves, and some games allow the player character to select from and use multiple fighting styles. Weapons and objects can also be wielded, though firearms are rare. Winning some of these battles can result in obtaining money or items which can be sold or used to purchase equipment or a variety of items in shops, gamble, or play mini-games. Encounter Battles caused by the story can end quicker by finishing the leader of the enemies, as well as by using powerful moves called Heat Actions, which require the filling of the 'Heat Gauge' to become usable. Some of these tend to include [[quick time event]]s. As the player character fights, they gain experience that can be used to increase their stats and become a stronger fighter. The newest installment in the series, ''Yakuza: Like a Dragon'', includes a new battle system where the player character recruits party members to fight alongside them in [[turn-based]] [[role-playing game]] battles against enemies, and to play alongside them in mini-games.\n\nThe series has a high number of entertaining sub-stories, which often complement the main story.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://levelskip.com/action-adventure/You-Will-Love-These-Yakuza-0-Substories |date=7 Jan 2019 |author=Kuan Leong Yong |accessdate=14 Mar 2019 |title=You'll love these Yakuza 0 Substories}}</ref> These give the player extra EXP. There are many mini-games, which range from activities like bowling, darts, and arcade games, to much more complex ones, like professions, which can take a number of hours over the course of several sessions to complete. Examples include:\n* Coliseum Fights: where the player fights in three-round mini championships against various opponents in different challenges to earn points which can be spent on unique items.\n* Weapon/gear crafting: the player needs to find various components and blueprints to produce powerful and varied gear and weapons.\n* Cabaret Club Management: the player runs a hostess club in three-minute sessions and tries to earn as much money as possible by matching up the right girl with the right client and quickly responding to their calls for help. They also take part in battles against other hostess clubs.\n* Pocket Circuit: a minigame where Pocket Circuit cars (like [[slot car]]s, but bounded by the car's lane and self-powered, similar to [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]'s [[Mini 4WD]] line of scale model cars) race against each other. In both ''Yakuza 0'' and ''Yakuza Kiwami'', there are several race series that take place and a number of side stories relating to this minigame.\n* Hostess/Cabaret Clubs: this involves talking to hostess girls to fill out their \"love\" gauge, as well as ordering the right food/drink, buying gifts and wearing the right accessories to please them as much as possible, until they can be taken out on a date. This was one of many aspects that was controversially cut from the western release of ''Yakuza 3'', leading to criticism of Sega for ignoring western gamers' desire to experience Japanese culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/sega-you-are-once-again-making-a-giant-mistake-5478862 |date=24 Feb 2010 |accessdate=14 Mar 2019 |author= Brian Ashcraft |title=Sega, You Are Once Again Making A Giant Mistake}}</ref> This content was restored in the remastered version. \n* [[Club Sega]]: a virtual recreation of the real-life Sega arcade chain that features activities such as [[UFO catcher]]s, darts, and playable emulations of classic Sega arcade titles such as ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'' and ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''. The available games differ with each series installment.\nA recurring [[superboss]] known as Amon appears in most of the games. Depending on the title, there may be more than one.

In this game, Majima has a calmer demeanor that develops during a war between multiple families in a fight for a patch of land known as the empty lot.

titles, including remakes. Note: this timeline is only for the main series, and the years they were originally released; therefore it does not include re-releases or spin-offs.\n|2005=''[[Yakuza (video game)|Yakuza]]''\n|2006=''[[Yakuza 2]]''\n|2009=''[[Yakuza 3]]''\n|2010=''[[Yakuza 4]]''\n|2012=''[[Yakuza 5]]''\n|2015=''[[Yakuza 0]]''\n|2016a=''[[Yakuza Kiwami]]''\n|2016b=''[[Yakuza 6: The Song of Life]]''\n|2017=''[[Yakuza Kiwami 2]]''\n|2020=''[[Yakuza: Like a Dragon]]''}}\nThe storytelling of the series is inspired by [[yakuza film]]s, one of the most popular [[Cinema of Japan|cinematic genres in Japan]]. The stories of the first two games in the series were supervised by novelist [[Hase Seishu]], a writer of [[crime fiction]]. The main story is presented in chapters, much like [[Kinji Fukasaku]]'s classic yakuza movie ''[[Sympathy for the Underdog]]'' and is expanded upon with around a hundred subplots per game. The depth this provides leads to the series having a large cast of characters, including many which recur in minor roles.\n\n==== ''Yakuza'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza (video game)}}\nThe first game follows the story of Kazuma Kiryu (\u6850\u751f \u4e00\u99ac Kiry\u016b Kazuma), a formerly promising ''yakuza'' who is released from a ten-year prison sentence in December 2005, having taken the fall for the murder of his family's patriarch to protect his sworn brother. The Tojo Clan he was once a member of has had \u00a510 billion (approximately US$100 million) stolen from their vault. The search for the money, undertaken by the entire Japanese underworld, results in Kiryu being forced back into the brutal, lawless world of the ''yakuza''. A mysterious young girl would lead Kiryu to the answers, if he can keep her alive.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 2'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 2}}\nIn 2006, Kazuma Kiryu has left his post as the Chairman of the Tojo Clan, Japan's most violent crime syndicate. When an all-out war erupts, Kiryu must return and uphold the honor of his former clan, with brutal clashes with rival gangs, the police, and the Korean mafia through the back alleys and neon-lit nightclubs of Tokyo and [[Osaka]].\n\n==== ''Yakuza 3'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 3}}\nIn March 2009, Kazuma Kiryu now runs the Morning Glory Orphanage in [[Okinawa]] where he raises nine children, including his surrogate daughter [[Haruka Sawamura]]. When an impending business deal threatens to tear down the orphanage, Kiryu travels from the beaches of Okinawa to the darkest side of Tokyo as he is pulled back to a life he thought he had left behind.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 4'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 4}}\nIn March 2010, Kazuma Kiryu is again involved in an incident in Kamurocho. First, a man is fatally shot on the turf of the powerful Tojo Clan. Then, a man investigating the murder is stabbed to death. These events spark a full-blown struggle for money, power, and above all, honor, in a story experienced through the eyes of four characters.\n\n==== ''Yakuza 5'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 5}}\nIn December 2012, the seventh chairman of the Omi Alliance is on his deathbed. His death would end the truce between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance, leading to a war between the clans. To prepare, the Tojo Clan is forced to strengthen their organization by aligning themselves with older clans based in other major cities across Japan to create a new organization, rivaling that of the Omi Alliance. This new alliance would breach the old traditional barriers of clan territories, leading Daigo Dojima to head for [[Fukuoka]].\n\n==== ''Yakuza 0'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 0}}\nIn December 1988, many years before the original ''Yakuza'', a young Kazuma Kiryu is framed for the murder of a civilian, leading him to be hunted by members of the Tojo clan. At the same time, Goro Majima finds himself protecting a helpless blind girl whom he was ordered to assassinate, making him a target himself. The two must each attempt to protect themselves and uncover the truth, including how both incidents are tied to the mysterious \"Empty Lot\".\n\n==== ''Yakuza 6'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza 6}}\nIn 2016, after willingly spending three years in prison for his past crimes, Kazuma Kiryu is released only to discover that his adoptive daughter Haruka has disappeared, later found comatose and critically injured after a hit-and-run incident. A devastated Kiryu decides to travel to Onomichi Jingaicho in Hiroshima, hoping to find the truth behind what happened to Haruka.\n\n==== ''Yakuza: Like a Dragon'' ====\n{{further|Yakuza: Like a Dragon}}\nIn 2019, Ichiban Kasuga, a former member of the Tojo Clan's Arakawa Family who is released after 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, ends up in Yokohama after the police and the Omi Alliance join forces.\n\n=== Spin-offs ===\n==== ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'' ====\n{{main|Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!}}\nThe first ''Yakuza'' series spin-off, ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'' is set in Kyoto during the [[Edo period]], in 1605, and follows the life of legendary swordsman [[Miyamoto Musashi]].

Seishu had been a video game player since the days of ''[[Space Invaders]]'', but over the past four or five years he had lost interest, as he was less concerned with 3D visuals and gameplay than he was with story. ''Yakuza'' caught his attention though, and he decided to accept the project even though it came at the busiest point of his professional writing career. Nagoshi wanted players to get enjoyment from merely walking through Kamurocho. Touching upon the game's name, Nagoshi revealed that it was his concoction. The original Japanese name ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku'' translates to \"Like a Dragon\", as Nagoshi felt that dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|title=Ryu Ga Gotoku Update|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{multiple image\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Yakuzakiwami2donquijote.jpg\n | alt1 = Don Quijote in real life\n | image2 =Donquijoteshinjukucropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Don Quijote in ''Yakuza''\n | footer = The [[Don Quijote (store)|Don Quijote]] store in Kamurocho (left), and its real-life equivalent in [[Kabukich\u014d]].

This strategy allows to support the game's costly production and at the same time gives a realistic aspect to the environments which are based on real locations in Tokyo, [[Osaka]] and [[Naha]]. In promoting the game, Sega hired [[Takashi Miike]], who directed the live-action ''[[Like a Dragon]]'' film. There were no problems in doing this due to a member from the team who was originally from the film industry who worked with [[Toei Company]] on V-cinema.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Sega went to a lot of companies to try to get brands into the game, like car companies and fashion companies, but because of the nature of the ''Yakuza'' game, they were turned down by most of them.{{cn|date=September 2019}} However, the company Suntory accepted them. Suntory wanted to sell whiskey, and they felt the game's demographic and the whiskey-drinking demographic would mesh nicely.<ref name=\"page3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|title=A Heart-To-Heart With Yakuza's Development Team|publisher=1UP.com|page=3|date=October 9, 2008|author=Gifford, Kevin|accessdate=March 28, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701161732/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|archivedate=July 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Clr}}\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n[[File:Ryu ga gotoku 3 GTMF2009 slideshow15.jpg|thumb|A ''Yakuza 3'' Event Mode minor character's face is being modeled in 3D through [[Softimage|Softimage XSI 6.5]] and during 3D scan the actor wore a [[swim cap]] because his character wears a police [[peaked cap]]<ref name=\"HPworkstation\"/>]]\nThe game's original voice actors are Japanese celebrities which can be voice actors, singers, ''[[tarento]]'', film or TV series actors, radio or television [[Celebrity|celebrities]]. Cabaret girls and alike characters have featured models, [[gravure idol]]s and adult actresses as voice actresses and likenesses. Since the 2008 spin-off ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!'', the game series' main characters have their face modeled in 3D after their voice actors. As in the [[Virtua Fighter (series)|''Virtua Fighter'' series]], Western main and minor characters do not speak in Japanese, but rather in English. Minor Chinese and Korean characters also often speak their native tongues.\n\nThe first game in the series to be released to the United States and PAL regions was dubbed in English. However, due to criticism of the English voice acting, each subsequent Western release has retained the original Japanese voice acting. Later spinoff titles such as ''Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise'' and ''Judgment'' have featured dual language voiceover support.\n\nThe [[PlayStation 3]] installments' realistic [[Character creation|character design]] is based on [[Cyberware Inc.|Cyberware]] [[3D scanner]], [[Softimage XSI|Softimage XSI 6.5]] 3D models<ref name=\"HPworkstation\">{{cite web|title=HP Workstation \u5c0e\u5165\u4e8b\u4f8b\u7d39\u4ecb\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac \u300c\u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f3\u300d|author=Hewlett-Packard Japan|publisher=Hewlett-Packard|url=http://h50146.www5.hp.com/products/workstations/personal_ws/case_studies/sega_ryugagotoku.html|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> and Sega's [[Magical V-Engine]].\n\n=== Localization changes ===\nWhen the series was [[Internationalization and localization|internationalized and localized]] to fit the Western market several changes occurred. These include changing the title of the game (''Like a Dragon'' \u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f, ''ry\u016b ga gotoku'' became ''Yakuza'') and the names of several characters (Shintaro Kazama is Shintaro Fuma, Akira Nishikiyama is Akira Nishiki, Futoshi Shimano is Futo Shimano, Sai no Hanaya is Kage).\n\n''Yakuza 4'' adjusted several of these localisation changes, following criticism of the previous games, and in particular the content excised from the Western release of ''Yakuza 3''. Producer Noguchi noted that there was an attempt to \"bring a more complete localization that was more faithful to the source material\". This included reversing several name changes. In addition, some conventions were changed; in previous Western localisations, protagonist Kazuma Kiryu had been referred to primarily by his first name. In ''Yakuza 4'', he is referred to primarily by his family name, Kiryu, which more closely reflects the original dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|title=Yakuza 4 Producer on Re-Localising the Series|date=2011-03-13|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Yakuza (video game) #Soundtrack|Yakuza 2#Soundtrack|Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!#Soundtrack|Yakuza 3#Soundtrack}}\nThe three ''Yakuza'' original soundtrack albums are composed by [[Hidenori Shoji]], [[Hideki Sakamoto]] ''et alii'' and are published by [[Wave Master]].

This color book was a [[monography]] dedicated to the game with [[Reina (Yakuza series)|Mai]], a sub-scenario female character, as the [[cover girl]]. This character's physical aspect was inspired by its voice actor, [[Mihiro]], a Japanese [[AV idol|adult video idol]] acting in porno films. Each new game release coincides with a new ''Kamutai Magazine'' issue featuring a voice actress as cover girl. Hence this December 2005 issue was followed by a December 2006 issue (cover girl is Japanese porn star [[Nana Natsume]]), a March 2008 issue (cover girl is Taiwanese porn star [[Yinling of Joytoy]]) and a February 2009 issue (cover girls are Shizuka Mutou, [[Sayaka Araki]] and Rina Sakurai).

Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas such as leather, dyed cloth, horse gear, metal locks and Kola nuts from the rain forest region to the south through trade or slave raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/hausa-city-states|title=Hausa City States (Nigeria) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=2009-08-24}}</ref> By the 12th century AD the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]] and the [[Mali Empire]].<ref>Hogben/[[Anthony Kirk-Greene]], ''Emirates'', 82-88; Lange, ''Kingdoms'', 216-221, 554 n. 25.</ref> The primary exports were [[leather]], [[gold]], [[Textile|cloth]], [[salt]], [[kola nuts]], [[slaves]], animal hides, and [[henna]].

It is a 50-foot edifice located in the centre of the city of Katsina, the capital of [[Katsina State]]. The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of [[Islamic architecture]] in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh [[Muhammad al-Maghili]] and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of [[Tlemcen]] in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture. It became an important centre for learning, attracting scholars and students from far and wide, and later served as a kind of university.\n<ref>zodml.org/discover-nigeria/heritage-and-culture/gobarau-minaret#.VTGE1yHBzGc</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad Rumfa]] was the Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Kano]], located in modern-day [[Kano State]], [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Nigeria]].

Since the early 20th century, these peoples are often classified as \"[[Hausa-Fulani]]\" within [[Nigeria]] rather than as individuated groups. In fact a large number of Fulani living in Hausa regions cannot speak Fulfulde at all and speak Hausa as their first language.

These results are consistent with linguistic and archeological data, suggesting a possible common ancestry of Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from an eastern Sudanese homeland within the past ~10,500 years, with subsequent bi-directional migration westward to Lake Chad and southward into modern day southern Sudan, and more recent migration eastward into Kenya and Tanzania ~3,000 ya (giving rise to Southern Nilotic speakers) and westward into Chad ~2,500 ya (giving rise to Central Sudanic speakers) (S62, S65, S67, S74). A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99). Our data suggest that this shift was not accompanied by large amounts of Afroasiatic16 gene flow.

It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), ''[[SIL Ethnologue]]''</ref> The main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern [[Ghana]], Cameroon, Chad, [[Sudanese Hausa]] in Sudan and the Ivory Coast as well as among [[Fulani]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Gur people|Gur]], [[Shuwa Arab]], and other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] speaking groups. There are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called ''zango''s or ''zongo''s, meaning \"caravan camp\" in Hausa (denoting the [[trade|trading post]] origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are [[Muslims]]; Hausa often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.\n\nThere is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.\n\nHausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.\n\nHausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of [[Islam]]ic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam. \n\nThe influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Gobarau Minaret Katsina.JPG|thumb|150px|The 15th-century Gobarau [[minaret]] in [[Katsina]]]]\n\nOrthodox [[Sunni]] Islam (Sufi Islam) is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people.

By the 14th Century Hausa traders were already spreading Islam across large swathe of west Africa such as Ghana, Cote d Ivoire etc.. \n\n[[Muslim scholars]] of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practiced in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref>Robinson, David, ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (Cambridge, 2004), p141</ref> The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current [[Sultan of Sokoto]] is regarded as the traditional religious leader (''Sarkin Musulmi'') of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.\n\n[[Maguzawa|Maguzanci]], an [[African Traditional Religion]], was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzanci. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzanci magic for harm. People of urbanized areas tend to retain a \"cult of [[spirit possession]],\" known as [[Bori (religion)|Bori]]. It incorporates the old religion's elements of [[African Traditional Religion]] and [[Magic and religion|magic]].<ref>Adeline Masquelier.

The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as ''Babban riga'' also known by various other names due to adaptation by many ethnic groups neighboring the Hausa (see [[indigo]] [[Boubou (clothing)|Babban Riga/Gandora]]). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area.\n\nMen also wear colourful embroidered caps known as ''hula.'' Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by [[wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]] called ''zani,'' made with colourful cloth known as ''atampa or Ankara'', (a descendant of early designs from the famous [[Tie-dye]] techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie (kallabi) and shawl (Gyale).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n[[File:Hausa architecture.jpg|thumb|alt=|Hausa home]]\n\n{{main article|Hausa Architecture}}The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age.

The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \n\nHausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of [[parapets]] related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts.

Its origin is shrouded in mystery. However, Edward Powe, a researcher of Nigerian martial art culture recognizes striking similarities in stance and single wrapped fist \u00a0of Hausa boxers to images of ancient Egyptian boxers from the 12th and 13th dynasties.\n\nIt originally started out among the lower class of Hausa Butcher caste groups and later developed into a way of practicing military skills and then \u00a0into sporting events through generations of Northern Nigerians. It is fought in rounds of three or less which have no time limits. A round ends if an opponent is knocked out, a fighter's knee, body or hand touch the ground, inactivity or halted by an official.\n\nDambe's primary weapon is the \u201cspear\u201d, a single dominant hand wrapped from fist to forearm in thick strips of cotton bandage that is held in place by knotted cord dipped in salt and allowed to dry for maximum body damage on opponents, while the other arm, held open, serve as the \u201cshield\" to protect fighters head from opponent's blows or used to grab an opponent.

This food is popularly known as ''tuwo'' in the Hausa language.\n\nUsually, breakfast consists of [[cakes]] made from ground beans and fried, known as ''kosai''; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as ''funkaso''. Both of these cakes can be served with [[porridge]] and [[sugar]] known as ''kunu'' or ''koko''. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as ''tuwo da miya''. The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, and local spices.\n\nSpices and other vegetables, such as [[spinach]], [[pumpkin]], or [[okra]], are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. [[Beans]], [[peanut]]s, and [[milk]] are also served as a complementary [[protein]] diet for the Hausa people.\n\nThe most famous of all Hausa food is most likely [[Suya]], a spicy [[shish kebab]] like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of [[West Africa]] and balangu or gasshi.\n\nA dried version of Suya is called [[Kilishi]].<ref name=\"Raw Story-2012\">{{cite news|last=Agence France-Presse|title=Nigerian roadside barbecue shacks thrive in the midst of Islamist insurgency|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/22/nigerian-roadside-barbecue-shacks-thrive-in-the-midst-of-islamist-insurgency/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:\u0645\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0637\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062e\u0637 \u0647\u0627\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a.jpg|thumb|A lithographic print from Nigeria in the early 20th century featuring text from the Surah of [[Hud (surah)|Hud]], printed in the [[Hausawi script|''Hausawi'' script]].]]\n[[File:Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07.png|thumb|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony]]\nA modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer [[Balaraba Ramat Yakubu]] came to popularity.

The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of [[Islamic architecture]] in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh [[Muhammad al-Maghili]] and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of [[Tlemcen]] in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture.

A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99).

It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), ''[[SIL Ethnologue]]''</ref> The main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern [[Ghana]], Cameroon, Chad, [[Sudanese Hausa]] in Sudan and the Ivory Coast as well as among [[Fulani]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Gur people|Gur]], [[Shuwa Arab]], and other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] speaking groups. There are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called ''zango''s or ''zongo''s, meaning \"caravan camp\" in Hausa (denoting the [[trade|trading post]] origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are [[Muslims]]; Hausa often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.\n\nThere is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.\n\nHausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.\n\nHausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of [[Islam]]ic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam. \n\nThe influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Gobarau Minaret Katsina.JPG|thumb|150px|The 15th-century Gobarau [[minaret]] in [[Katsina]]]]\n\nOrthodox [[Sunni]] Islam (Sufi Islam) is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people.

By the 14th Century Hausa traders were already spreading Islam across large swathe of west Africa such as Ghana, Cote d Ivoire etc.. \n\n[[Muslim scholars]] of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practiced in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref>Robinson, David, ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (Cambridge, 2004), p141</ref> The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current [[Sultan of Sokoto]] is regarded as the traditional religious leader (''Sarkin Musulmi'') of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.\n\n[[Maguzawa|Maguzanci]], an [[African Traditional Religion]], was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzanci. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzanci magic for harm. People of urbanized areas tend to retain a \"cult of [[spirit possession]],\" known as [[Bori (religion)|Bori]].

They were often characterized by their [[Indigo]] blue dressing and emblems which earned them the nickname \"bluemen\". They traditionally rode on fine Saharan [[camels]] and [[Arabian horses|horses]]. [[Tie-dye]] [[Art techniques and materials|techniques]] have been used in the Hausa region of [[West Africa]] for centuries with renowned [[indigo]] dye pits located in and around [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]]. The tie-dyed clothing is then richly [[Embroidery|embroidered]] in traditional patterns. It has been suggested that these African techniques were the inspiration for the tie-dyed garments identified with [[hippie]] fashion.\n[[File:Hausa traditional clothing (Babbar riga) June 2016.jpg|alt=|thumb|One category of Hausa traditional clothing (Babbar riga)]]\n\nThe traditional dress of the Hausa consists of loose flowing gowns and trousers. The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as ''Babban riga'' also known by various other names due to adaptation by many ethnic groups neighboring the Hausa (see [[indigo]] [[Boubou (clothing)|Babban Riga/Gandora]]). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area.\n\nMen also wear colourful embroidered caps known as ''hula.'' Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by [[wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]] called ''zani,'' made with colourful cloth known as ''atampa or Ankara'', (a descendant of early designs from the famous [[Tie-dye]] techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie (kallabi) and shawl (Gyale).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n[[File:Hausa architecture.jpg|thumb|alt=|Hausa home]]\n\n{{main article|Hausa Architecture}}The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early [[mosques]] and palaces are bright and colourful, including intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ateliermasomi.com/blog/187|title=Building Facades in Hausa Architecture}}</ref> This architectural style is known as ''[[Tubali]]'' which means ''architecture'' in the Hausa language. The ancient Kano city walls were built in order to provide security to the growing population. The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \n\nHausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of [[parapets]] related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ateliermasomi.com/blog/187|title=Building Facades in Hausa Architecture}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe Hausa culture is rich in traditional sporting events such as boxing ([[Dambe]]), stick fight (Takkai), wrestling (Kokawa) etc. that were originally organized to celebrate harvests but over the generations developed into sporting events for entertainment purposes.\n\n#'''[[Dambe]]'''\nDambe is a brutal form of traditional martial art associated with the Hausa people of West Africa. Its origin is shrouded in mystery. However, Edward Powe, a researcher of Nigerian martial art culture recognizes striking similarities in stance and single wrapped fist \u00a0of Hausa boxers to images of ancient Egyptian boxers from the 12th and 13th dynasties.\n\nIt originally started out among the lower class of Hausa Butcher caste groups and later developed into a way of practicing military skills and then \u00a0into sporting events through generations of Northern Nigerians. It is fought in rounds of three or less which have no time limits. A round ends if an opponent is knocked out, a fighter's knee, body or hand touch the ground, inactivity or halted by an official.\n\nDambe's primary weapon is the \u201cspear\u201d, a single dominant hand wrapped from fist to forearm in thick strips of cotton bandage that is held in place by knotted cord dipped in salt and allowed to dry for maximum body damage on opponents, while the other arm, held open, serve as the \u201cshield\" to protect fighters head from opponent's blows or used to grab an opponent. Fighters usually end up with split brows, broken jaws and noses or even sustain brain damage.Dambe fighters may receive money, cattle, farm produce or jewelry as winnings but generally it was fought for fame from representations of towns and fighting clans.\n\n=== Food ===\n[[File:\"Kilishi\".JPG|right|thumb|[[Kilishi]], a Hausa delicacy similar to [[jerky]]]]\nThe most common food that the Hausa people prepare consists of [[Cereal|grains]], such as [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[rice]], or [[maize]], which are ground into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as ''tuwo'' in the Hausa language.\n\nUsually, breakfast consists of [[cakes]] made from ground beans and fried, known as ''kosai''; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as ''funkaso''. Both of these cakes can be served with [[porridge]] and [[sugar]] known as ''kunu'' or ''koko''. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as ''tuwo da miya''. The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, and local spices.\n\nSpices and other vegetables, such as [[spinach]], [[pumpkin]], or [[okra]], are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. [[Beans]], [[peanut]]s, and [[milk]] are also served as a complementary [[protein]] diet for the Hausa people.\n\nThe most famous of all Hausa food is most likely [[Suya]], a spicy [[shish kebab]] like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of [[West Africa]] and balangu or gasshi.\n\nA dried version of Suya is called [[Kilishi]].<ref name=\"Raw Story-2012\">{{cite news|last=Agence France-Presse|title=Nigerian roadside barbecue shacks thrive in the midst of Islamist insurgency|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/22/nigerian-roadside-barbecue-shacks-thrive-in-the-midst-of-islamist-insurgency/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:\u0645\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0637\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062e\u0637 \u0647\u0627\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a.jpg|thumb|A lithographic print from Nigeria in the early 20th century featuring text from the Surah of [[Hud (surah)|Hud]], printed in the [[Hausawi script|''Hausawi'' script]].]]\n[[File:Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07.png|thumb|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony]]\nA modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer [[Balaraba Ramat Yakubu]] came to popularity. In time, the writers spurred a unique genre known as Kano market literature \u2014 so named because the books are often self-published and sold in the markets of Nigeria. [[Islamic extremism]] and [[misogyny]] have hindered women's ability to work and write openly. However, the subversive nature of these novels, which are often romantic and family dramas that are otherwise hard to find in the Hausa language, have made them popular, especially among female readers. The genre is also referred to as ''littattafan soyayya'', or \"love literature.\"<ref>Laura Mallonee, [https://www.wired.com/2016/02/glenna-gordon-diagram-heart/ The Subversive Women Who Self-Publish Novels Amid Jihadist War], Wired, 17 February 2016.</ref>\n\n===Hausa symbolism===\nThe Hausa [[ethnic flag]] is a banner with five horizontal stripes\u2014from top to bottom they are red, yellow, indigo blue, green, and khaki beige.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html#nr|title=Hausa ethnic flag|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313025512/http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html|archivedate=13 March 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 April 2017|website=www.fotw.us}}</ref> The older and traditionally established motif of Hausa identity, the 'Dagin Arewa' [[eternal knot]] in a star shape, is used in historic architecture, design and embroidery.\n\n==Notable Hausa people==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please, only people with an article -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sir Ahmad Bello Sardaunan Sokoto]] \n* [[Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] \n* [[Alhaji Ado Bayero]] \n* [[Alhaji Tijjani Hashim]] \n* [[Alhaji Ahmad Chanchangi]] \n* [[Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau]]\n* [[Abdulkareem Baba Aminu]]\n* [[Abubakar Imam|Abubakar Imam Kagara]]\n* [[Ahmed Musa (footballer)|Ahmed Musa]]\n* [[Aisha Augie-Kuta]]\n* [[Abdul Samad Rabiu|Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu]]\n* [[Alhassan Dantata|Alhaji Alhassan Dantata]]\n* [[Aminu Dantata|Alhaji Aminu Dantata]]\n* [[Aliko Dangote|Alhaji Aliko Dangote]]\n* [[Sani Dangote|Alhaji Sani Dangote]]\n* [[Isa Kaita|Alhaji Isa Kaita]]\n* [[Isyaku Rabiu|Alhaji Isyaku Rabiu]]\n* [[Mamman Shata|Alhaji Mamman Shata Katsina]]\n* [[Umaru Mutallab|Alhaji Umaru Mutallab]]\n* [[Ali Nuhu]]\n* [[Amadou Moutari]]\n* [[Amina Sukhera]]\n* [[Attahiru Jega]]\n* [[Dan Maraya|Dan Maraya Jos]]\n* [[Daouda Malam Wank\u00e9]]\n* [[Haruna Babangida]]\n* [[Ibrahim Bar\u00e9 Ma\u00efnassara]]\n* [[Ibrahim Umar|Ibrahim H.
