The series is animated in Ireland by [[Brown Bag Films]] and uses British voice actors. The TV series is based on American-Canadian children's books written by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of [[Meomi Design]] Inc. The show follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized [[anthropomorphic]] animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from which they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles. Although its technology is fictional, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are based on real marine animals in their natural habitats. ''The Octonauts'' has been renewed for a 5th series that will \"introduce new environments, [...] characters and a new fleet of vehicles\" to be released sometime in 2020.<ref>https://www.awn.com/news/silvergate-media-produce-fashion-ally-nick</ref> The subject matter is reminiscent of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/16/octonauts3.shtml interview with executive producer Kurt Mueller] BBC Press Office</ref> blended with [[Jacques Cousteau]].\n\n==Books==\nThe original books were first published in the US by Immedium in 2006, and were republished in the UK by [[Harper Collins]] in 2009. Six titles by Meomi have been published:\n\n*''The Octonauts & the Only Lonely Monster'', about an [[Architeuthis]] (Giant Squid).\n*''The Octonauts & the Sea of Shade'', about a world where everyone's shadows have gone missing.\n*''The Octonauts & the Frown Fish'', about a glum-looking [[catfish]].\n*''The Octonauts & the Great Ghost Reef'', about [[coral bleaching]].\n*''The Octonauts Explore the Great Big Ocean'', about the search for Tunip the Vegimal's home.\n*''The Octonauts & the Growing Goldfish'', about Dunkie, a giant goldfish who won't stop growing.\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2010, ''The Octonauts'' was adapted into a 52 episode [[CGI animation|CGI animated]] television series co-produced by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] and Brown Bag Films. It first aired in the UK on 4 October 2010 on CBeebies, a [[BBC]] television channel for the under 7's. The first series ended in February 2011, but continued to be aired as repeats. A second series of 22 episodes commenced in November 2012.\n\n''The Octonauts'' had its US premiere on the [[Disney Channel]] in January 2012, however many of the characters' voices were redubbed to give them American accents\u2014Hispanic in the case of Peso and Pinto\u2014although Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Prof. Inkling retained their original British voices.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/review/RRB8I9IN1QVD6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071651BY Amazon customer review]</ref> It has also been shown in Ireland ([[RT\u00c9 Two]]), Canada ([[Treehouse TV]]), and Australia ([[ABC Television]]). The show has been translated and shown in French ([[TF1]]), Spanish and Portuguese ([[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids Latin America]]), Finnish ([[YLE TV2]]), Welsh ([[S4C]]) and Slovakian ([[Dvojka|STV 2]]).<ref>[http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/c_level2.shtml?programme_id=500613693 S4C Octonots page.]</ref>\n\nThe series was made with the help of [[marine biologist]]s Dr. Lara A. Ferry-Graham and Dr. Michael H. Graham, who had previously worked on ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\"/>\n\nThe TV show is episodic, with each 11 minute episode seeing them encountering an unusual but real sea creature as they explore strange underwater worlds. Often they must discover a vital biological or behavioral fact about that creature to rescue it or themselves from danger. The stories usually feature three main characters: Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Peso, with the other five Octonauts acting in supporting roles.\n\nIn the TV series they use five sea-creature-inspired underwater vehicles called GUP-A to GUP-E, the pedal driven GUP-F, driven by Captain Barnacles and Kwazii, which appears in Episode 10 of Series 1 (''The Speedy Sailfish''), the narwhal-shaped submarine Gup-S that can split so one half goes over land, the train-shaped vegimal-driven Gup-V, and the powerful and sturdy tracked GUP-X, first appearing in Episode 52 of Series 1 (''The Great Christmas Rescue'').\n\nThe opening theme tune finishes with the chant \"Explore! - Rescue! - Protect!\", the Octonauts\u2019 motto.\n\n===TV spin-off books===\nA series of shorter books based on individual episodes from the TV series is being published by [[Simon & Schuster]].\nThese titles can be distinguished by the \"As seen on TV\" label on the covers and are not written or illustrated by Meomi.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1XHWYXRVLRA8/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857072366&nodeID=266239 Amazon customer review]</ref> The books have the same titles as the episodes they are based on.\n\n==Reception==\nThe TV series was well received when shown on CBeebies in the UK and by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in Australia. According to the authors' website, it was the No. 1 pre-school age show in the UK, and the first pre-school show to be ranked in the top ten by older audiences (aged 3\u20134 and up).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/octonauts|title=Octonauts - TV Review|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}</ref> The show was the top-ranked ABC programme for 5-12 year olds in January 2011 in Australia, with the ABC calling its first month an \"unprecedented success online and on-air\".<ref>[http://blogs.abc.net.au/abc_tv/2011/02/multiplatorm-success-for-abc-for-kids-series-octonauts.html Multiplatform success for ABC For Kids series, Octonauts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909030816/http://blogs.abc.net.au/abc_tv/2011/02/multiplatorm-success-for-abc-for-kids-series-octonauts.html |date=9 September 2011 }}</ref>\nIt has been rated 7.4 out of 10 on [[IMDb]].<ref>{{IMDb title|1710177}} ''(Retrieved 8 April 2013)''</ref> In 2013, Octonauts was nominated for (but did not win) two awards: an [[International Emmy Award]] in the ''\"Kids\u2014Preschool\"'' category<ref>[http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_nominees.aspx International Emmy Kids Awards Nominees]</ref>\nand an [[Irish Film and Television Award]] in the ''\"Best Children's/Youth Programme\"'' category.<ref>[http://ifta.ie/nominee_2013/childrenyouthtv.html Irish Film and Television Awards]</ref>\nThe Octonauts DVD boxed set was 4th best-selling Children's TV DVD at [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] UK as of 7 April 2013.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bestsellers/dvd/501960/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_d_h__1_3_last Amazon best-seller list] retrieved 7 April 2013</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Characters==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The series is animated in Ireland by [[Brown Bag Films]] and uses British voice actors. The TV series is based on American-Canadian children's books written by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of [[Meomi Design]] Inc. The show follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized [[anthropomorphic]] animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from which they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles. Although its technology is fictional, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are based on real marine animals in their natural habitats. ''The Octonauts'' has been renewed for a 5th series that will \"introduce new environments, [...] characters and a new fleet of vehicles\" to be released sometime in 2020.<ref>https://www.awn.com/news/silvergate-media-produce-fashion-ally-nick</ref> The subject matter is reminiscent of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/16/octonauts3.shtml interview with executive producer Kurt Mueller] BBC Press Office</ref> blended with [[Jacques Cousteau]].\n\n==Books==\nThe original books were first published in the US by Immedium in 2006, and were republished in the UK by [[Harper Collins]] in 2009. Six titles by Meomi have been published:\n\n*''The Octonauts & the Only Lonely Monster'', about an [[Architeuthis]] (Giant Squid).\n*''The Octonauts & the Sea of Shade'', about a world where everyone's shadows have gone missing.\n*''The Octonauts & the Frown Fish'', about a glum-looking [[catfish]].\n*''The Octonauts & the Great Ghost Reef'', about [[coral bleaching]].\n*''The Octonauts Explore the Great Big Ocean'', about the search for Tunip the Vegimal's home.\n*''The Octonauts & the Growing Goldfish'', about Dunkie, a giant goldfish who won't stop growing.\n\n==TV series==\nIn 2010, ''The Octonauts'' was adapted into a 52 episode [[CGI animation|CGI animated]] television series co-produced by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] and Brown Bag Films. It first aired in the UK on 4 October 2010 on CBeebies, a [[BBC]] television channel for the under 7's. The first series ended in February 2011, but continued to be aired as repeats. A second series of 22 episodes commenced in November 2012.\n\n''The Octonauts'' had its US premiere on the [[Disney Channel]] in January 2012, however many of the characters' voices were redubbed to give them American accents\u2014Hispanic in the case of Peso and Pinto\u2014although Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Prof. Inkling retained their original British voices.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/review/RRB8I9IN1QVD6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071651BY Amazon customer review]</ref> It has also been shown in Ireland ([[RT\u00c9 Two]]), Canada ([[Treehouse TV]]), and Australia ([[ABC Television]]). The show has been translated and shown in French ([[TF1]]), Spanish and Portuguese ([[Discovery Kids (Latin America)|Discovery Kids Latin America]]), Finnish ([[YLE TV2]]), Welsh ([[S4C]]) and Slovakian ([[Dvojka|STV 2]]).<ref>[http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/c_level2.shtml?programme_id=500613693 S4C Octonots page.]</ref>\n\nThe series was made with the help of [[marine biologist]]s Dr. Lara A. Ferry-Graham and Dr. Michael H. Graham, who had previously worked on ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.<ref name=\"bbc-mueller\"/>\n\nThe TV show is episodic, with each 11 minute episode seeing them encountering an unusual but real sea creature as they explore strange underwater worlds. Often they must discover a vital biological or behavioral fact about that creature to rescue it or themselves from danger. The stories usually feature three main characters: Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Peso, with the other five Octonauts acting in supporting roles.\n\nIn the TV series they use five sea-creature-inspired underwater vehicles called GUP-A to GUP-E, the pedal driven GUP-F, driven by Captain Barnacles and Kwazii, which appears in Episode 10 of Series 1 (''The Speedy Sailfish''), the narwhal-shaped submarine Gup-S that can split so one half goes over land, the train-shaped vegimal-driven Gup-V, and the powerful and sturdy tracked GUP-X, first appearing in Episode 52 of Series 1 (''The Great Christmas Rescue'').\n\nThe opening theme tune finishes with the chant \"Explore! - Rescue! - Protect!\", the Octonauts\u2019 motto.\n\n===TV spin-off books===\nA series of shorter books based on individual episodes from the TV series is being published by [[Simon & Schuster]].\nThese titles can be distinguished by the \"As seen on TV\" label on the covers and are not written or illustrated by Meomi.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1XHWYXRVLRA8/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857072366&nodeID=266239 Amazon customer review]</ref> The books have the same titles as the episodes they are based on.\n\n==Reception==\nThe TV series was well received when shown on CBeebies in the UK and by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in Australia. According to the authors' website, it was the No. 1 pre-school age show in the UK, and the first pre-school show to be ranked in the top ten by older audiences (aged 3\u20134 and up).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/octonauts|title=Octonauts - TV Review|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}</ref> The show was the top-ranked ABC programme for 5-12 year olds in January 2011 in Australia, with the ABC calling its first month an \"unprecedented success online and on-air\".<ref>[http://blogs.abc.net.au/abc_tv/2011/02/multiplatorm-success-for-abc-for-kids-series-octonauts.html Multiplatform success for ABC For Kids series, Octonauts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909030816/http://blogs.abc.net.au/abc_tv/2011/02/multiplatorm-success-for-abc-for-kids-series-octonauts.html |date=9 September 2011 }}</ref>\nIt has been rated 7.4 out of 10 on [[IMDb]].<ref>{{IMDb title|1710177}} ''(Retrieved 8 April 2013)''</ref> In 2013, Octonauts was nominated for (but did not win) two awards: an [[International Emmy Award]] in the ''\"Kids\u2014Preschool\"'' category<ref>[http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_nominees.aspx International Emmy Kids Awards Nominees]</ref>\nand an [[Irish Film and Television Award]] in the ''\"Best Children's/Youth Programme\"'' category.<ref>[http://ifta.ie/nominee_2013/childrenyouthtv.html Irish Film and Television Awards]</ref>\nThe Octonauts DVD boxed set was 4th best-selling Children's TV DVD at [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] UK as of 7 April 2013.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bestsellers/dvd/501960/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_d_h__1_3_last Amazon best-seller list] retrieved 7 April 2013</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Characters==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After a few weeks they established themselves as an integral part of the crew.<ref name=Meomi2013>{{cite book |last=Meomi |date=2013 |title=The Octonauts Explore The Great Big Ocean |url= |location= |publisher=HarperCollins Children's Books |page= |isbn=978-0007510610 |author-link= }}</ref>\n|}\n'''Note''': Recent UK editions of the books changed Sauci's name to Dashi to match the television series. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Other Vegimals<ref name=Meomi2013 />===\n*'''Albachoy''', half-bok choy and half-albacore\n*'''Barrot''', half-bass, half-carrot.

The district covers an area of 4,152&nbsp;km\u00b2. The district has a population of 2,632,733 (2011 Census). [[Fatehpur, Fatehpur|Fatehpur]] city is the administrative headquarters of the district. Located on the banks of the [[sacred]] rivers [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]], Fatehpur was mentioned in the ''[[puranic]]'' literature. The ''[[ghats]]'' of [[Bhitaura]] and [[Asani]] were described as sacred in the ''[[puranas]]''. Bhitaura, the site of the [[Wise old man|sage]] [[Bhrigu]], was an important source of learning. Fatehpur district is a part of [[Allahabad division]].\n\nThis district is situated between two important cities: [[Allahabad]], (officially known as Prayagraj), and [[Kanpur]] of the state Uttar Pradesh. Fatehpur is well connected with those cities by train routes and roads. The distance from Allahabad is 117&nbsp;km and from Kanpur is 76&nbsp;km by railway. The north boundary of the district is limited by the river Ganges and its southern boundary is the river [[Yamuna]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nIn the [[Vedic period|Vedic era]] the region of this district was known as \"Antardesh\", which means the fertile area between two big rivers.  Later, it was known as \"Madhyadesh\" which means the central region. The northern region of the district is influenced by \"Avadhi culture\", while the southern part shows the effect of the \"Bundelkhand\". The territory covered by the present-day Fatehpur district was part of [[Vatsa]], which was one among sixteen [[mahajanapada]]s described in the Buddhist literature. General Karningham has written about \"Bhitaura\" and \"Asani\" places of this district while discussing the heritage of the Vedic Period. There is evidence that the Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] visited the Asani area within this district.\n\nIn village Renh, which is 25&nbsp;km in the south-west of Fatehpur town, some articles of [[archaeology|archaeological]] interest have been found, which date from 800 B.C. Many artefacts, including coins, bricks and idols of the [[Mauryan dynasty|Maurya]] period, '[[Kushan dynasty|Kushan period]] & [[Gupta period]] have been found throughout the district. Many temples of the Gupta period still exist in village Tenduli, Korari and Sarhan Bujurg which are important archaeological sites. Golden coins of the period of [[Chandragupta II]] have been recovered from the village of Bijauli. The bricks used in the fort of Asani are also of the Gupta Period.\n\nKhajuha town, situated on Mughal road is a very old town. Its description has been found in the old Hindu scripture \"Brahm Puran\", which is 5000 years old.\n\nIn 1561 A.D., the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] passed through this town while invading Jaunpur state.  On 5 January 1659 A.D., Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] had a fierce battle with his brother prince [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)]], and killed him near this place. To celebrate the victory, he constructed a large garden \"Badshahi Bagh\" and a big lodge having 130 rooms.

The district covers an area of 4,152&nbsp;km\u00b2. The district has a population of 2,632,733 (2011 Census). [[Fatehpur, Fatehpur|Fatehpur]] city is the administrative headquarters of the district. Located on the banks of the [[sacred]] rivers [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]], Fatehpur was mentioned in the ''[[puranic]]'' literature. The ''[[ghats]]'' of [[Bhitaura]] and [[Asani]] were described as sacred in the ''[[puranas]]''. Bhitaura, the site of the [[Wise old man|sage]] [[Bhrigu]], was an important source of learning. Fatehpur district is a part of [[Allahabad division]].\n\nThis district is situated between two important cities: [[Allahabad]], (officially known as Prayagraj), and [[Kanpur]] of the state Uttar Pradesh. Fatehpur is well connected with those cities by train routes and roads. The distance from Allahabad is 117&nbsp;km and from Kanpur is 76&nbsp;km by railway. The north boundary of the district is limited by the river Ganges and its southern boundary is the river [[Yamuna]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nIn the [[Vedic period|Vedic era]] the region of this district was known as \"Antardesh\", which means the fertile area between two big rivers.  Later, it was known as \"Madhyadesh\" which means the central region. The northern region of the district is influenced by \"Avadhi culture\", while the southern part shows the effect of the \"Bundelkhand\". The territory covered by the present-day Fatehpur district was part of [[Vatsa]], which was one among sixteen [[mahajanapada]]s described in the Buddhist literature. General Karningham has written about \"Bhitaura\" and \"Asani\" places of this district while discussing the heritage of the Vedic Period. There is evidence that the Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] visited the Asani area within this district.\n\nIn village Renh, which is 25&nbsp;km in the south-west of Fatehpur town, some articles of [[archaeology|archaeological]] interest have been found, which date from 800 B.C. Many artefacts, including coins, bricks and idols of the [[Mauryan dynasty|Maurya]] period, '[[Kushan dynasty|Kushan period]] & [[Gupta period]] have been found throughout the district. Many temples of the Gupta period still exist in village Tenduli, Korari and Sarhan Bujurg which are important archaeological sites. Golden coins of the period of [[Chandragupta II]] have been recovered from the village of Bijauli. The bricks used in the fort of Asani are also of the Gupta Period.\n\nKhajuha town, situated on Mughal road is a very old town. Its description has been found in the old Hindu scripture \"Brahm Puran\", which is 5000 years old.\n\nIn 1561 A.D., the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] passed through this town while invading Jaunpur state.  On 5 January 1659 A.D., Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] had a fierce battle with his brother prince [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)]], and killed him near this place. To celebrate the victory, he constructed a large garden \"Badshahi Bagh\" and a big lodge having 130 rooms. During the Mughal regime, the control of Fatehpur changed hands between rulers of Jaunpur, Delhi and Kannauj.\n\nIn 1801 A.D., this region came under the control of East India Company. On 10 November 1826,  Fatehpur has designated as the [[List of districts in India|District]] headquarters.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

The creek chubsucker is small in size typically measuring less than 10 inches and weighing slightly under pound. There is generally no [[sexual dimorphism]] exhibited between males and females and lifespan is typically from five to seven years. However, dimorphism does exist between juveniles and adults, with juveniles displaying a uniform, dark lateral stripe down the sides.<ref name=etnier/> Both sexes exhibit longitudinal scale rows, 4\u201318 dorsal fin rays, an [[air bladder]] with two chambers, dorsal fin base less than one-fourth standard length, and lateral line absent.<ref>Hubbs, C.

The western subspecies spawns at water temperatures of 12\u201324 degrees C, spawning in the afternoon.<ref name=curry/> Habitat suitable for spawning is usually in small creeks with small cleared depressions on clear, gravel bottoms of pools just above riffles.<ref name=curry/> Prior to spawning, males and females migrate upstream where possible. Males defend territories in moderately swift water over beds of gravel or near pits constructed by various minnow species. Males do not initiate the digging of nest pits, but will modify existing pits by pushing stones around with their snouts. Females congregate upstream of males in quiet water, periodically drifting tail first into male territories. Once in a male's territory, the female digs in the gravel with her snout, apparently signaling to the male that she is ready to spawn. In contrast to most species of suckers, creek chubsuckers frequently engage in trio spawning involving two males on either side of one female. Actual spawning lasts three to five seconds as the males press against the female. Both release gametes while quivering and stirring the substratum with their [[Caudal fin|caudal]] and [[Anal Fin|anal]] fins.<ref name=page/> The fertilized eggs are demersal and semi adhesive. Color varies from light to deep golden yellow, and yolk occupies most of egg with no oil drops in the yolk mass. Egg production has been extremely variable with anywhere between 8,500 and over 80,000 eggs being produced by a single female. Regardless of high fecundity this species is not found in high numbers.<ref name=wagner/> Females may live for 6 or 7 years, though males only live for 5 years.<ref name=wagner/>\n\n==Current management==\nCurrently, the creek chubsucker is of least concern according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].<ref name =goldstein>Goldstein, R.M. and Simon, T.P., \"Toward a United Definition of Guild Structure for Feeding Ecology of North American Freshwater Fishes.\" Assessing the Sustainability and Biological Integrity of Water Resources Using Fish Communities (1999): 123-202</ref> The presence of creek chubsuckers usually indicates the presence of other, more desirable game species. There is currently no [[Wildlife Management|management plan]] to control or monitor the fish. Because of its wide range, the creek chubsucker is native to many areas that fall inside the boundaries of protected national and state parks, and this will hopefully ensure its existence for future generations. Several [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]] factors have been noted as leading to the decline of the creek chubsucker like areas where [[siltation]] pollution occurs. Siltation pollution is produced from a variety of sources including but not limited to construction, logging, and agricultural practices. Dams may also be of concern for the species however most areas inhabited by creek chubsuckers are small order streams and may not be suitable for dam construction.\n\n==Management recommendations==\nThe creek chubsucker is an important species in lotic water systems. It is a fish that turns over energy by consuming vegetation detritus.<ref name=goldstein/> The creek chubsucker also regulates population levels of macro-invertebrates and algae, and it serves as an important prey fish for many desirable game fish species.<ref name=wagner/> It is important to survey and monitor the population of this species in order to get an estimation of the health of the immediate ecosystem.<ref name=goldstein/> More measures like water and sediment sampling as well as mark and recapture techniques should be put into place to compile data on creek chubsucker population levels and health. Periodic, random electroshocking and seining would be ideal for conducting mark and recapture surveys in low order streams. The eggs of the creek chubsuckers are a valuable source of energy for many creatures of the lotic stream system. Special emphasis should be placed on promoting high levels of breeding individuals to ensure breeding adult recruitment, therefore continuing a viable food source for other organisms. Buffer zones should be implemented around all streams in the vicinity of disturbances that could cause sediment pollution. Excessive siltation fills the gravel beds used for egg laying during spawning and deprives eggs of oxygen. Dams may also pose a problem by not allowing the fish to access areas used for breeding, but little information exists on their effects on the creek chubsucker.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5389086}}\n\n[[Category:Catostomidae]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of the United States]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of North America]]\n", "text_old": "{{Underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| image = Erimyzon oblongus.jpg\n| taxon = Erimyzon oblongus\n| authority =([[Samuel L.

The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the south east of the village of [[Litton, Derbyshire|Litton]]. [[Cressbrook]] village is at the foot of the valley to the south.<ref name=\"OS\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]] which runs into the mill pond at Cressbrook Mill and then into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] in Water-cum-Jolly Dale.\n\n== Nature Reserve ==\nCressbrook Dale is part of the [[Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve]]. [[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and [[Monk's Dale|Monk\u2019s Dale]]). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[Ulmus glabra|wych elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Mercurialis perennis|dog\u2019s mercury]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Viburnum opulus|guelder rose]], [[hazel]], [[bird cherry]] and [[Cornus|dogwood]]. Wildflowers in the reserve include  [[Lily of the valley|lily-of-the-valley]], [[Allium ursinum|ramsons]] and [[Geranium sanguineum|bloody cranesbill]]. There are broad areas of scrub with [[Crataegus|Hawthorn]], [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|buckthorn]] and rose. [[Helictotrichon pratense|Meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] spread across the ungrazed grasslands, with patches of rare bird\u2019s-foot sedge (''Carex ornithopoda''). Cressbrook Dale is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).

The layers were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). The Carboniferous Limestone contains important fossils.

Retrieved 2008-06-20</ref><ref name=\"Ancestry\">[http://ancestry.co.uk Ancestry].</ref>\n\nJacques grew up in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]] near to the [[Liverpool Docks]]. He was known by his middle name, Brian, because his father and a brother were also named James. His father loved literature and read his boy adventure stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], but also ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' with its cast of animals.  Jacques showed early writing talent. At age ten, assigned to write an animal story, he wrote about a [[Egyptian plover|bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth]]. His teacher could not believe that a ten-year-old wrote it, and caned the boy for refusing to admit copying the story.<ref name=\"Official Bio\" /> He had always loved to write, but only then did he realize the extent of his abilities.  He attended St John's School until age fifteen, when he left school (as was usual at the time) and set out to find adventure as a merchant sailor. His book ''[[Redwall (novel)|Redwall]]'' was written for his \"special friends\",<ref name=\"Official Bio\"/> the children of the [[Royal School for the Blind (Liverpool)|Royal Wavertree School for the Blind]], whom he first met while working as a milkman. He began to spend time with the children, reading books to them. However, he became dissatisfied with the state of children's literature, with too much adolescent angst and not enough magic,{{cn|date=August 2016}} and eventually began to write stories for them. He is known for the very descriptive style of his novels, which emphasize sound, smell, taste, gravity, balance, temperature, touch, and kinesthetics, not just visual sensations.  His work gained acclaim when [[Alan Durband]], his former English teacher (who also taught [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]]), showed it to his (Durband's) own publisher without telling Jacques.<ref name=\"Official Bio\" /> Durband told his publishers: \"This is the finest children's tale I've ever read, and you'd be foolish not to publish it\". Soon after, Jacques was summoned to London to meet with the publishers, who gave him a contract to write the next five books in the series.\n\n''Redwall'' was an 800-page handwritten manuscript.<ref name=\"latimes\">[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/13/local/la-me-brian-jacques-20110213 Brian Jacques dies at 71; author of 'Redwall' children's fantasy novels] ''latimes.com''. Retrieved February 2013.</ref> It is now common for children's books to have 350 pages, and the ''Harry Potter'' books far exceed that, but in those days 200 was regarded as the maximum that would hold a child's attention.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> It set the tone for the whole series, centered on the triumph of good over evil, with peaceful mice, badgers, voles, hares,  moles and squirrels defeating rats, weasels, ferrets, snakes and stoats. He did not shy away from the reality of battle, and many of the \"good\" creatures die.  \n''Redwall'' alludes to the surrounding human civilization, for example with a scene featuring a horse-drawn cart. But the subsequent books ignore humans completely, portraying an Iron Age society from the misty past building castles, bridges and ships to the scale of forest creatures, writing their own literature and drawing their own maps. Jacques was highly involved in the audio books of his work, even enlisting his sons and others to voice Redwall inhabitants. Jacques said that the characters in his stories are based on people he has encountered. He based Gonff, the self-proclaimed \"Prince of Mousethieves\", on himself when he was a young boy hanging around the docks of Liverpool.<ref name=\"Official FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redwall.org/faq.php|title=Q&A with Brian Jacques|accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref> Mariel is based on his granddaughter. Constance the Badgermum is based on his maternal grandmother. Other characters are a combination of many of the people he has met in his travels.<ref name=\"Official FAQ\"/>\n\nJacques remembered well the rationing during the war, when he fantasized about the dishes in his aunt's illustrated Victorian cookbook. Groaning boards spread with sumptuous feasts are common scenes in his stories, described in mouth-watering detail. The war also informed his depictions of gruesome battles.  Jacques was known to prefer old-fashioned ways; he always preferred an old typewriter as being more reliable than a computer, and he was known to be not fond of videogames and other modern technology, though he allowed an animated television series to be produced which he introduced himself each episode on PBS and answered children's questions after the cartoon ended. The Teletoon airings omitted that. He never felt that he fit the image of a \"writer sitting in his garden.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Nonetheless he was deeply touched by his success at reaching children. He was also pleased to be recognized by the people of Liverpool.  His novels have sold more than twenty million copies worldwide<ref name=\"latimes\" /> and have been published in twenty-eight languages.\n\nJacques also had musical interests. In the 1960s he formed a folk music band, the Liverpool Fishermen, with two of his brothers. He hosted a radio show called ''[[Jakestown]]'' on [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] from 1986 to 2006, featuring selections from his favourite operas.<ref name=\"Scholastic Bio\" />\n\nIn June 2005, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref name=\"Official Bio\"/> A prize was created at [[Bristol Grammar School]], known as the 'Brian Jacques Award for Most Improved Creative Writing', and is awarded to a student in Year 8, as book tokens.<ref name=\"Bristol Review of Books\">[http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx BGS: 150 and not out] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604062919/http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx# |date=4 June 2016 }} - accessed May 2016</ref>\n\nHe lived with his wife, Maureen, in Liverpool.

Retrieved 2008-06-20</ref><ref name=\"Ancestry\">[http://ancestry.co.uk Ancestry].</ref>\n\nJacques grew up in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]] near to the [[Liverpool Docks]]. He was known by his middle name, Brian, because his father and a brother were also named James. His father loved literature and read his boy adventure stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], but also ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' with its cast of animals.  Jacques showed early writing talent. At age ten, assigned to write an animal story, he wrote about a [[Egyptian plover|bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth]]. His teacher could not believe that a ten-year-old wrote it, and caned the boy for refusing to admit copying the story.<ref name=\"Official Bio\" /> He had always loved to write, but only then did he realize the extent of his abilities.  He attended St John's School until age fifteen, when he left school (as was usual at the time) and set out to find adventure as a merchant sailor. His book ''[[Redwall (novel)|Redwall]]'' was written for his \"special friends\",<ref name=\"Official Bio\"/> the children of the [[Royal School for the Blind (Liverpool)|Royal Wavertree School for the Blind]], whom he first met while working as a milkman. He began to spend time with the children, reading books to them. However, he became dissatisfied with the state of children's literature, with too much adolescent angst and not enough magic,{{cn|date=August 2016}} and eventually began to write stories for them. He is known for the very descriptive style of his novels, which emphasize sound, smell, taste, gravity, balance, temperature, touch, and kinesthetics, not just visual sensations.  His work gained acclaim when [[Alan Durband]], his former English teacher (who also taught [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]]), showed it to his (Durband's) own publisher without telling Jacques.<ref name=\"Official Bio\" /> Durband told his publishers: \"This is the finest children's tale I've ever read, and you'd be foolish not to publish it\". Soon after, Jacques was summoned to London to meet with the publishers, who gave him a contract to write the next five books in the series.\n\n''Redwall'' was an 800-page handwritten manuscript.<ref name=\"latimes\">[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/13/local/la-me-brian-jacques-20110213 Brian Jacques dies at 71; author of 'Redwall' children's fantasy novels] ''latimes.com''. Retrieved February 2013.</ref> It is now common for children's books to have 350 pages, and the ''Harry Potter'' books far exceed that, but in those days 200 was regarded as the maximum that would hold a child's attention.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> It set the tone for the whole series, centered on the triumph of good over evil, with peaceful mice, badgers, voles, hares,  moles and squirrels defeating rats, weasels, ferrets, snakes and stoats. He did not shy away from the reality of battle, and many of the \"good\" creatures die.  \n''Redwall'' alludes to the surrounding human civilization, for example with a scene featuring a horse-drawn cart. But the subsequent books ignore humans completely, portraying an Iron Age society from the misty past building castles, bridges and ships to the scale of forest creatures, writing their own literature and drawing their own maps. Jacques was highly involved in the audio books of his work, even enlisting his sons and others to voice Redwall inhabitants. Jacques said that the characters in his stories are based on people he has encountered. He based Gonff, the self-proclaimed \"Prince of Mousethieves\", on himself when he was a young boy hanging around the docks of Liverpool.<ref name=\"Official FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redwall.org/faq.php|title=Q&A with Brian Jacques|accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref> Mariel is based on his granddaughter. Constance the Badgermum is based on his maternal grandmother. Other characters are a combination of many of the people he has met in his travels.<ref name=\"Official FAQ\"/>\n\nJacques remembered well the rationing during the war, when he fantasized about the dishes in his aunt's illustrated Victorian cookbook. Groaning boards spread with sumptuous feasts are common scenes in his stories, described in mouth-watering detail. The war also informed his depictions of gruesome battles.  Jacques was known to prefer old-fashioned ways; he always preferred an old typewriter as being more reliable than a computer, and he was known to be not fond of videogames and other modern technology, though he allowed an animated television series to be produced which he introduced himself each episode on PBS and answered children's questions after the cartoon ended. The Teletoon airings omitted that. He never felt that he fit the image of a \"writer sitting in his garden.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Nonetheless he was deeply touched by his success at reaching children. He was also pleased to be recognized by the people of Liverpool.  His novels have sold more than twenty million copies worldwide<ref name=\"latimes\" /> and have been published in twenty-eight languages.\n\nJacques also had musical interests. In the 1960s he formed a folk music band, the Liverpool Fishermen, with two of his brothers. He hosted a radio show called ''[[Jakestown]]'' on [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] from 1986 to 2006, featuring selections from his favourite operas.<ref name=\"Scholastic Bio\" />\n\nIn June 2005, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref name=\"Official Bio\"/> A prize was created at [[Bristol Grammar School]], known as the 'Brian Jacques Award for Most Improved Creative Writing', and is awarded to a student in Year 8, as book tokens.<ref name=\"Bristol Review of Books\">[http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx BGS: 150 and not out] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604062919/http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/Downloads/Senior-School/BGS-150-not-out.aspx# |date=4 June 2016 }} - accessed May 2016</ref>\n\nHe lived with his wife, Maureen, in Liverpool.
