He is known for his zeal in carrying out the ecclesiastical policy of James VI and I, in which he was effective if crude.\n\n==Life==\n\nHe was the second son of Sir Andrew Murray of Arngask and [[Balvaird Castle|Balvaird]], brother of [[William Murray of Tullibardine]], by his second wife, Janet Graham, fourth daughter of [[William Graham, 2nd Earl of Montrose]]. He was brought up at the court of [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], who made him his cupbearer in 1580, and master of the horse in 1583.<ref>Amy Juhala, 'For the King Favours Them Very Strangely', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J. Reid, ''James VI and Noble Power'' (Routledge: Abingdon, 2017), p. 165.</ref> On 12 December 1588 he presented a complaint against the inhabitants of [[Auchtermuchty]], Fife, who, when he went to take possession of the lands of Auchtermuchty, attacked him and the gentlemen of his company, wounding him in various parts of the body, and cutting off one of the fingers of his right hand. At court he opposed the [[Octavians]] by creating trouble between them and the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish kirk]]. After he had been knighted by James VI (the date is uncertain) he was, on 26 April 1599, admitted on the privy council aand made [[Comptroller of Scotland|comptroller of the royal revenues]], replacing [[George Home (Comptroller of Scotland)|George Home of Wedderburn]] in April 1599.<ref>Amy Juhala, 'For the King Favours Them Very Strangely', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J. Reid, ''James VI and Noble Power'' (Routledge: Abingdon, 2017), p. 165.</ref> He was also made steward of the stewartry of Fife. On 6 December 1599, while holding a court at [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], was attacked by neighbouring lairds and their servants.\n\nMurray was at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] at the time of the [[Gowrie conspiracy]], 5 August 1600, and was subsequently credited with having been privy to the concoction of a semblance of a plot, aiming the overthrow of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]]. He took a prominent part calming the inhabitants of Perth after Gowrie, their provost, was killed, and with others succeeded in bringing the king in safety to Falkland. Murray succeeded Gowrie as provost of Perth, and also obtained a grant of the [[barony of Ruthven]], and of the lands belonging to the [[abbacy of Scone]], of which Gowrie was [[commendator]]. In May 1601 he was appointed by the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|assembly of the kirk]] one of a commission to discuss how to support the kirk and clergy in all the districts of Scotland. On 10 Nov he obtained from the king the castle land of Falkland, with the office of ranger of the Lomonds and forester of the woods.\n\nMurray was one of the retinue who attended King James in 1603 when he went to take possession of the English throne. On his return to Scotland on 11 August he obtained a commission for raising a guard or police of forty horsemen to be at the service of the privy council. He was one of the Scottish commissioners named by the parliament of Perth in 1604 to treat concerning a union with England, when he was created Viscount Stormont.  On 1 April 1605 the barony of Ruthven and the lands belonging to the abbacy of Scone were erected into the temporal lordship of Scone, with a seat and vote in parliament, with which he was invested; on 30 May 1606 he had charter of the barony of Segie, erected into the lordship of Segie; and on 18 August 1608 of the lands and barony which belonged to [[Scone Abbey|abbacy of Scone]], united into the temporal lordship of Scone.\n\nIn June 1605 Scone, as comptroller and captain of the guards, was appointed to proceed to [[Kintyre]] in Argyllshire to receive the obedience of the chiefs of the clans of the southern [[Hebrides]], and payment of the king's rents and duties. He was one of the assessors for the trial at [[Linlithgow]] in January 1606 of the ministers concerned in the contumacious [[Aberdeen assembly]] of 1605. In March 1607 he was appointed one of the commissioners to represent the king in the synods of Perth and Fife, in connection with the scheme for the appointment of perpetual moderators. The synod of Perth having resisted his proposal for the appointment of [[Alexander Lindsay of Evelick (bishop)|Alexander Lindsay]] as perpetual moderator, he, in the king's name, dissolved the assembly, and as the members of the assembly resolved to proceed to the choice of their own moderator, a violent scene ensued. Scone, being asked by the moderator in the name of Christ to desist troubling the meeting, replied, 'The devil a Jesus is here.' After attempting by force to prevent the elected moderator taking the chair, Scone sent for the bailies of the town, and commanded them to ring the common bell and remove the rebels. On pretence of consulting the council of the city the bailies withdrew, but did not return, and avoided interference in the dispute. After the close of the sitting Scone locked the doors, but the assembly met in the open air and proceeded with their business. After Scone's contest with the synod of Perth, the synod of Fife, which should have met at Dysart on 28 April, was on the 23rd prorogued on pretence of the prevalence of the pestilence in the burgh. When it did meet, on 18 August, it also proved contumacious.\n\nIn November 1607 Scone was censured by the privy council for negligence in his duty as captain of the guard in not securing the arrest of the [[David Lindsay, 11th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]] and the laird of Edzell, and he was also, on 2 February 1608, urged to adopt more energetic measures for the arrest of Lord Maxwell. Some time before March 1608 he was succeeded in the comptrollership by Sir James Hay of Fingask, but he still continued to hold the office of captain of the guard. As commissioner from the king he took part in the ecclesiastical conference at Falkland on 4 May 1609, in regard to the discipline of the kirk, and he was one of the lords of the articles for the parliament which met at Edinburgh in the following June. On 8 March 1609 he was appointed one of a commission for preventing the dilapidation of the bishoprics, and on the 23rd he was appointed, along with [[George Gledstanes]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], to examine the charge against John Fairfull, minister of Dunfermline, of having prayed for the restoration of the banished ministers, with the result that Fairfull was found guilty. Scone was chosen one of the members of the privy council on its reconstruction, 20 January 1610, when it was limited to thirty-five members. On the institution of the office of [[justice of the peace]] in June 1610, he was appointed justice for the counties of Fife, Kinross, and Perth. On 15 November he was appointed one of the assessors to aid the [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Earl of Dunbar]] as treasurer. On 25 April 1611 an act was passed by the privy council disbanding the king's guard, but Scone was still to receive his pay as captain, and on 11 June he was authorised to retain nine of the guard for the apprehension of persons for the non-payment of taxes. Subsequently, the guard was placed under the command of [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Ancram|Sir Robert Ker of Ancrum]], and Scone had an act exonerating him for all he had done while holding the office of captain.\n\nScone was one of the three commissioners appointed by the king to the general assembly at Perth on 5 August 1618, when sanction was given to the [[Five Articles of Perth]]. He was also the king's commissioner to a conference between the bishops and presbyterian ministers at St. Andrews in August 1619. At the parliament held at Edinburgh in July 1621 he was chosen by the bishops one of the lords of the articles; and after the sanction by parliament of the five articles of the Perth assembly he the same night set off to London with the news. He was, by patent of 16 August, raised to the dignity of Viscount Stormont. On 19 May 1623 he was named one of a commission to sit in Edinburgh twice a week for the hearing of grievances. He died 27 August 1631, and was buried at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], where he had erected a monument to his memory designed by [[Maximilian Colt]] in 1618.<ref>Pearson, Fiona ed., ''Virtue and Vision, Sculpture and Scotland'', National Galleries of Scotland (1991), 8, 28.</ref>\n\nHis epitaph at Scone includes: 'he helped his friends, who enjoy the fruits of his labour; his buildings proofs he was politique; good men knew he loved virtue, and malefactors that he maintained justice; he founded this hospital, and builded this church; his soul enjoys happiness; and under this tomb builded by himself, lies his body.'<ref>Nisbet, Alexander, ''A System of Heraldry,'' vol. 2, reprint (1984), 204\u2013206.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nStormont had, on 20 July 1625, been served heir male and entire of Sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird, the son of his brother, and on 26 October of the same year made a settlement of the lordship of Scone and other estates to certain relatives of the name of Murray. As by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of David Beaton of [[Creich]], [[Fife]], he had no issue, he secured the succession of his titles to Sir Mungo Murray, son of [[John Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine]], who had married his niece Anne, eldest daughter of Sir Andrew Murray of Arngask.

At court he opposed the [[Octavians]] by creating trouble between them and the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish kirk]]. After he had been knighted by James VI (the date is uncertain) he was, on 26 April 1599, admitted on the privy council aand made [[Comptroller of Scotland|comptroller of the royal revenues]], replacing [[George Home (Comptroller of Scotland)|George Home of Wedderburn]] in April 1599.<ref>Amy Juhala, 'For the King Favours Them Very Strangely', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J.

On 6 December 1599, while holding a court at [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], was attacked by neighbouring lairds and their servants.\n\nMurray was at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] at the time of the [[Gowrie conspiracy]], 5 August 1600, and was subsequently credited with having been privy to the concoction of a semblance of a plot, aiming the overthrow of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]]. He took a prominent part calming the inhabitants of Perth after Gowrie, their provost, was killed, and with others succeeded in bringing the king in safety to Falkland. Murray succeeded Gowrie as provost of Perth, and also obtained a grant of the [[barony of Ruthven]], and of the lands belonging to the [[abbacy of Scone]], of which Gowrie was [[commendator]]. In May 1601 he was appointed by the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|assembly of the kirk]] one of a commission to discuss how to support the kirk and clergy in all the districts of Scotland.

These were basically copies or variations of Gibson and Fender amplifiers{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. They used a tube design, and some had reverb and tremolo. Gibson decided to launch a new line of Epiphone amplifiers in 2005 with many different models, including the ''So Cal,'' ''Blues Custom,'' and the ''[[Epiphone Valve Junior]]''. The Valve Hot Rod and Valve Senior were released in 2009.  The Valve Hot Rod is a 5 watt amp like the Valve Junior, but has a gain and reverb control.  The Valve Senior offers 20 watts of power, with a full equalizer, gain, volume, reverb, and presence control.\n\nAs of 2012, Epiphone has ceased production of their line of amplifiers with the exception of the Player and Performance Pack practice amplifiers, available only in Epiphone's starter packages. These Amplifiers are under the Epiphone Electar moniker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/Features/2012/Epiphone-Introduces-Three-New-Electric-Packs!.aspx |title=Epiphone Introduces Three New Electric Packs! |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing==\n\n===US===\nEpiphone instruments made between 1957 and 1970 were made beside the Gibson factory at 224 Parsons (Gibson located at 225 Parsons) St and on Elenor St; Kalamazoo, MI 49007.\nSolid body guitars with flat tops and backs were made at the Elenor Street plants (both Gibson and Epiphone) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Some of these Epiphone instruments were effectively identical to the relevant Gibson versions, perhaps made with same timber, materials and components as the contemporary equivalent Gibson guitars. Epiphone also continued its production of world class archtop guitars using the same patterns and molds from Epi's New York era. \nSome specific examples of Gibson-era Epiphone instruments from this period includes the [[Epiphone Sheraton]] (co-developed with the [[Gibson ES-335]] & sharing its semi-hollow body, but with, Epiphone's pre-Gibson \"Frequensator\" tailpiece and \"New York\" mini-humbucker pickups, and significantly fancier inlays) and Sheraton II (replacing the Frequensator with Gibson's \"stop-bar\" tailpiece), the [[Epiphone Casino]] (similar to the [[Gibson ES-330]]), the Epiphone Caballero (similar to the Gibson LG-0), the Epiphone Cortez (similar to the Gibson LG-2), the Epiphone Olympic Special (similar to the [[Gibson Melody Maker]]), the Epiphone Sorrento (similar to the [[Gibson ES-125]]TC, except for a few cosmetic changes), and the [[Epiphone Texan]] (similar to the [[Gibson J-45]], apart from a change in scale-length). The other Kalamazoo-made Epiphones had technical or cosmetic relationship with the similar Gibson version.\n\nSeveral Epiphone guitars have been produced in the United States after 1971. The [[Gibson Spirit|Epiphone Spirit]] and Special were produced in the early 1980s in Kalamazoo.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 1993, three historic Epiphone acoustic guitars, the Texan, Frontier, and Excellente, were produced by Gibson Acoustic in Montana.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Paul McCartney Texan was produced in 2005, and in 2009, the Epiphone Historic Collection was created, beginning with the 1962 Wilshire, built by Gibson Custom. Several other models, such as the Sheraton and John Lennon Casinos, were built in Japan and assembled and finished by Gibson USA.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Japan===\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[Matsumoku]] began to manufacture Epiphone instruments in Japan<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryANewBeginning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#ANewBeginning|publisher=Epiphone.com|accessdate=22 February 2012|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 A New Beginning}}</ref>  with the production and distribution being managed by [[Aria (guitar company)|Aria]], in cooperation with Gibson. At this time, Epiphone ceased production of all of its traditional designs and began manufacturing markedly less expensive guitars, many of which had less traditional bolt-on style necks and unspecified wood types.<ref>1971 & 1974 Epiphone Catalogs</ref> Some of these guitars had similar body shapes to traditional Epiphone and Gibson designs but had different names while other models retained certain model designations, such as the FT (Flat Top) guitars.<ref>1974 & 1976 Epiphone catalogs</ref> Construction of these guitars differed greatly from past Epiphone models. For the first several years of production in Japan, Epiphone guitars were actually rebranded designs already produced by the Matsumoku Company.<ref name=\"A NewBeginning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx |title=History |publisher=Epiphone.com |date=1909-03-25 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1975, the Japanese market started seeing some of the more familiar designs and names being reintroduced. These guitars were of higher quality than that of the previous years of production in Japan and included models such as the Wilshire, Emperor, Riviera and Newport bass.<ref>1977 Epiphone Japan catalog</ref> These models were available to the Japanese market only. By 1976 new designs of higher quality were being introduced for export but did not include the current Japanese market models. Notable new designs from this era were the Monticello (Scroll Guitar), the Presentation (PR) and Nova series flat tops and the [[Epiphone Genesis|Genesis]] solid body guitar. By 1980, most Japanese-only designs were available for worldwide distribution. The Matsumoku-made archtops, such as the Emperor, Riviera, Sheraton and Casino, were available into the mid-1980s.\n\n===Korea===\nFrom the 1980s, Epiphones were manufactured mainly in South Korea and Japan by contractors licensed by Gibson.<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryANewBeginning\" /><ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#EpiphoneInKorea|publisher=Epiphone.com|accessdate=22 February 2012|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 Epiphone in Korea}}</ref> One of these contractors was [[Samick]],<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\" /> which also built instruments under license for other brands and in its own name. The brand was primarily used to issue less expensive versions of classic Gibson models.<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\" />\n\nThese guitars were constructed using different woods (generally only distantly related to [[Mahogany|true]] [[Mahogany_(disambiguation)|Mahogany]]), were fastened with epoxies rather than wood-glues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Gibson and Epiphone guitars all use Titebond resin glue, which is simple carpenters' wood glue, and were finished in hard, quick-to-apply polyester resin rather than the traditional nitro-cellulose lacquer used by Gibson{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Epiphone guitars assembled or made in the US use lacquer finishes unless its a san lacquer (SL for short), but those made outside of the US use a poly urethane finish because of pollution requirements. These particular budget considerations, along with others such as plastic nuts and cheaper hardware and pickups, allow for a more affordable instrument.\n\nSince 1996 the Epiphonese were build by the Peerless Guitars Co. Ltd., established in 1970 in Busan, South Korea.\n\n===China===\n\nIn 2004, Gibson opened a factory in [[Qingdao]], China, which manufactures Epiphone guitars.<ref name=\"Jim Rosenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/News/2004/A-Chat-With-Epiphone-President-Jim-Rosenberg.aspx |title=A-Chat-With-Epiphone-President-Jim-Rosenberg |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref> With few exceptions, Epiphones are now built only in the Qingdao factory.<ref name=\"Jim Rosenberg\" />\n\nUnique Epiphone models, including the Emperor, Zephyr, Riviera and Sheraton, are built to higher quality standards than the company's \"Gibson copy\" line{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In 2004 Epiphone introduced a series of acoustic guitars named Masterbilt after a line of guitars of the 1930s, which are built in the same factory.<ref name=\"Epiphone Masterbilt Series\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.epiphone.com/images/0704-Epiphone.final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Epiphone Masterbuilt Series |publisher=Epiphone |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Series and Elitist===\nDuring the early 1990s Epiphone released a series called the Imperial Series. These were remakes of the classic Epiphone archtops of the 1930s and '40s. Each instrument was handmade in the [[FujiGen]] factory in Japan.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} This short-lived series was discontinued in 1993, after only 42 Emperors were made.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Several other models, including De Luxe, Broadway and Triumph models, were also produced in varying quantities.\n\nProduction was moved back to Nashville and Bozeman for a similar limited run of instruments (250 each of Sheratons, Rivieras, Frontiers, Excellentes and Texans).<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryTakingOnTheWorld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#TakingOnTheWorld|publisher=Epiphone.com|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 Taking On The World}}</ref> These guitars were the \"Nashville USA Collection\" (archtops) and the \"Anniversary Series\" (acoustics). Contrary to popular information, this line was related to, but not part of the 1994 Gibson Centennial Series commemorating 100 years of the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Nashville and Anniversary Collections were intended as reintroductions of original, USA built Epiphone models.\n\nIn 2002, Epiphone began producing a range of higher quality instruments under the \"Elite Series\" moniker which were built by Terada and FujiGen in Japan.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} After legal action by Ovation the name was changed to Elitist in 2003. As of 2008, all of the Elitist models have been discontinued with the exception of the Elitist Casino and the Dwight Trash Casino. The Epiphone Elitist guitars included features such as higher grade woods, bone nuts, hand-rubbed finishes, \"Made in the USA\" pickups and USA strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.epiphone.com/elitist/details.htm |title=Epiphone Elitist |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref> [[Japanese domestic market]] Elitists used the Gibson Dove-wing [[headstock]] as opposed to the \"tombstone\" headstock used on exports.<ref>2002 Epiphone Japan Elite/Elitist catalog</ref>\n\n==Serial numbers and factory codes==\n\nCurrent Epiphone serial numbers give the following information:<ref name=\"Gibson Support: Serial Number Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/support/serialnumbersearch/ |title=Serial Number Search |publisher=Gibson |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref>\n\nKorea\n\n*I = Saein\n*U = Unsung\n*S = Samick\n*P or R = Peerless\n*K = Korea\n*F = Fine\n*C = Korea\n\nChina\n*MR = CHINA\n*DW = DaeWon\n*EA = Gibson/QingDao\n*EE = Gibson/QingDao\n*MC = Muse\n*SJ = SaeJung\n*Z = Zaozhuang Saehan\n*BW = China\n\nJapan\n\n*No letter or F = FujiGen\n*J or T = Terada\n\nCzech Republic\n\n*B = Boh\u00eamia Musico-Delicia\n\nIndonesia\n*CI = cort indonesia\n\n*SI = Samick Indonesia\n\nExample: SI09034853 SI = Samick Indonesia, 09 = 2009, 03 = March, 4853 = manufacturing number.\n\nYYMMFF12345\n\n*YY year\n*MM month\n*FF factory-code\n*12345 production#\n*FACTORY NUMBER CODES\u2014for some models starting in 2008, if serial # begins w/numbers\n*[NOTE: The factories identified by these codes are based on patterns that forum members have observed.

Stathopoulo moved to the [[United States]] in 1903 and continued to make his original instruments, as well as [[mandolin]]s, from a factory at 35-37 36th Street in [[Long Island City]], [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

After Epi died in 1943, control of the company went to his brothers, Orphie and Frixo.

This outfit was an amplifier, case and lap steel guitar stand all rolled into one unit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.epiphone.com/thevintagecollection|title=Epiphone \u2013 The Vintage Collection|author=|date=|website=www2.epiphone.com}}</ref> and was supplied by a suitcase manufacturer of the time.\n\nGibson produced Epiphone amplifiers in the 1960s. These were basically copies or variations of Gibson and Fender amplifiers{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. They used a tube design, and some had reverb and tremolo. Gibson decided to launch a new line of Epiphone amplifiers in 2005 with many different models, including the ''So Cal,'' ''Blues Custom,'' and the ''[[Epiphone Valve Junior]]''. The Valve Hot Rod and Valve Senior were released in 2009.  The Valve Hot Rod is a 5 watt amp like the Valve Junior, but has a gain and reverb control.  The Valve Senior offers 20 watts of power, with a full equalizer, gain, volume, reverb, and presence control.\n\nAs of 2012, Epiphone has ceased production of their line of amplifiers with the exception of the Player and Performance Pack practice amplifiers, available only in Epiphone's starter packages. These Amplifiers are under the Epiphone Electar moniker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/Features/2012/Epiphone-Introduces-Three-New-Electric-Packs!.aspx |title=Epiphone Introduces Three New Electric Packs! |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing==\n\n===US===\nEpiphone instruments made between 1957 and 1970 were made beside the Gibson factory at 224 Parsons (Gibson located at 225 Parsons) St and on Elenor St; Kalamazoo, MI 49007.\nSolid body guitars with flat tops and backs were made at the Elenor Street plants (both Gibson and Epiphone) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Some of these Epiphone instruments were effectively identical to the relevant Gibson versions, perhaps made with same timber, materials and components as the contemporary equivalent Gibson guitars. Epiphone also continued its production of world class archtop guitars using the same patterns and molds from Epi's New York era. \nSome specific examples of Gibson-era Epiphone instruments from this period includes the [[Epiphone Sheraton]] (co-developed with the [[Gibson ES-335]] & sharing its semi-hollow body, but with, Epiphone's pre-Gibson \"Frequensator\" tailpiece and \"New York\" mini-humbucker pickups, and significantly fancier inlays) and Sheraton II (replacing the Frequensator with Gibson's \"stop-bar\" tailpiece), the [[Epiphone Casino]] (similar to the [[Gibson ES-330]]), the Epiphone Caballero (similar to the Gibson LG-0), the Epiphone Cortez (similar to the Gibson LG-2), the Epiphone Olympic Special (similar to the [[Gibson Melody Maker]]), the Epiphone Sorrento (similar to the [[Gibson ES-125]]TC, except for a few cosmetic changes), and the [[Epiphone Texan]] (similar to the [[Gibson J-45]], apart from a change in scale-length). The other Kalamazoo-made Epiphones had technical or cosmetic relationship with the similar Gibson version.\n\nSeveral Epiphone guitars have been produced in the United States after 1971. The [[Gibson Spirit|Epiphone Spirit]] and Special were produced in the early 1980s in Kalamazoo.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 1993, three historic Epiphone acoustic guitars, the Texan, Frontier, and Excellente, were produced by Gibson Acoustic in Montana.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Paul McCartney Texan was produced in 2005, and in 2009, the Epiphone Historic Collection was created, beginning with the 1962 Wilshire, built by Gibson Custom. Several other models, such as the Sheraton and John Lennon Casinos, were built in Japan and assembled and finished by Gibson USA.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Japan===\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[Matsumoku]] began to manufacture Epiphone instruments in Japan<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryANewBeginning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#ANewBeginning|publisher=Epiphone.com|accessdate=22 February 2012|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 A New Beginning}}</ref>  with the production and distribution being managed by [[Aria (guitar company)|Aria]], in cooperation with Gibson. At this time, Epiphone ceased production of all of its traditional designs and began manufacturing markedly less expensive guitars, many of which had less traditional bolt-on style necks and unspecified wood types.<ref>1971 & 1974 Epiphone Catalogs</ref> Some of these guitars had similar body shapes to traditional Epiphone and Gibson designs but had different names while other models retained certain model designations, such as the FT (Flat Top) guitars.<ref>1974 & 1976 Epiphone catalogs</ref> Construction of these guitars differed greatly from past Epiphone models. For the first several years of production in Japan, Epiphone guitars were actually rebranded designs already produced by the Matsumoku Company.<ref name=\"A NewBeginning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx |title=History |publisher=Epiphone.com |date=1909-03-25 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1975, the Japanese market started seeing some of the more familiar designs and names being reintroduced. These guitars were of higher quality than that of the previous years of production in Japan and included models such as the Wilshire, Emperor, Riviera and Newport bass.<ref>1977 Epiphone Japan catalog</ref> These models were available to the Japanese market only. By 1976 new designs of higher quality were being introduced for export but did not include the current Japanese market models. Notable new designs from this era were the Monticello (Scroll Guitar), the Presentation (PR) and Nova series flat tops and the [[Epiphone Genesis|Genesis]] solid body guitar. By 1980, most Japanese-only designs were available for worldwide distribution. The Matsumoku-made archtops, such as the Emperor, Riviera, Sheraton and Casino, were available into the mid-1980s.\n\n===Korea===\nFrom the 1980s, Epiphones were manufactured mainly in South Korea and Japan by contractors licensed by Gibson.<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryANewBeginning\" /><ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#EpiphoneInKorea|publisher=Epiphone.com|accessdate=22 February 2012|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 Epiphone in Korea}}</ref> One of these contractors was [[Samick]],<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\" /> which also built instruments under license for other brands and in its own name. The brand was primarily used to issue less expensive versions of classic Gibson models.<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryEpiphoneInKorea\" />\n\nThese guitars were constructed using different woods (generally only distantly related to [[Mahogany|true]] [[Mahogany_(disambiguation)|Mahogany]]), were fastened with epoxies rather than wood-glues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Gibson and Epiphone guitars all use Titebond resin glue, which is simple carpenters' wood glue, and were finished in hard, quick-to-apply polyester resin rather than the traditional nitro-cellulose lacquer used by Gibson{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Epiphone guitars assembled or made in the US use lacquer finishes unless its a san lacquer(SL for short), but those made outside of the US use a poly urethane finish because of pollution requirements. These particular budget considerations, along with others such as plastic nuts and cheaper hardware and pickups, allow for a more affordable instrument.\n\nSince 1996 the Epiphonese were build by the Peerless Guitars Co. Ltd., established in 1970 in Busan, South Korea.\n\n===China===\n\nIn 2004, Gibson opened a factory in [[Qingdao]], China, which manufactures Epiphone guitars.<ref name=\"Jim Rosenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/News/2004/A-Chat-With-Epiphone-President-Jim-Rosenberg.aspx |title=A-Chat-With-Epiphone-President-Jim-Rosenberg |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref> With few exceptions, Epiphones are now built only in the Qingdao factory.<ref name=\"Jim Rosenberg\" />\n\nUnique Epiphone models, including the Emperor, Zephyr, Riviera and Sheraton, are built to higher quality standards than the company's \"Gibson copy\" line{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

These were remakes of the classic Epiphone archtops of the 1930s and '40s. Each instrument was handmade in the [[FujiGen]] factory in Japan.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} This short-lived series was discontinued in 1993, after only 42 Emperors were made.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Several other models, including De Luxe, Broadway and Triumph models, were also produced in varying quantities.\n\nProduction was moved back to Nashville and Bozeman for a similar limited run of instruments (250 each of Sheratons, Rivieras, Frontiers, Excellentes and Texans).<ref name=\"EpiphoneAHistoryTakingOnTheWorld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx#TakingOnTheWorld|publisher=Epiphone.com|title=Epiphone: A History \u2013 Taking On The World}}</ref> These guitars were the \"Nashville USA Collection\" (archtops) and the \"Anniversary Series\" (acoustics). Contrary to popular information, this line was related to, but not part of the 1994 Gibson Centennial Series commemorating 100 years of the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Nashville and Anniversary Collections were intended as reintroductions of original, USA built Epiphone models.\n\nIn 2002, Epiphone began producing a range of higher quality instruments under the \"Elite Series\" moniker which were built by Terada and FujiGen in Japan.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} After legal action by Ovation the name was changed to Elitist in 2003. As of 2008, all of the Elitist models have been discontinued with the exception of the Elitist Casino and the Dwight Trash Casino. The Epiphone Elitist guitars included features such as higher grade woods, bone nuts, hand-rubbed finishes, \"Made in the USA\" pickups and USA strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.epiphone.com/elitist/details.htm |title=Epiphone Elitist |publisher=Epiphone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref> [[Japanese domestic market]] Elitists used the Gibson Dove-wing [[headstock]] as opposed to the \"tombstone\" headstock used on exports.<ref>2002 Epiphone Japan Elite/Elitist catalog</ref>\n\n==Serial numbers and factory codes==\n\nCurrent Epiphone serial numbers give the following information:<ref name=\"Gibson Support: Serial Number Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/support/serialnumbersearch/ |title=Serial Number Search |publisher=Gibson |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref>\n\nKorea\n\n*I = Saein\n*U = Unsung\n*S = Samick\n*P or R = Peerless\n*K = Korea\n*F = Fine\n*C = Korea\n\nChina\n*MR = CHINA\n*DW = DaeWon\n*EA = Gibson/QingDao\n*EE = Gibson/QingDao\n*MC = Muse\n*SJ = SaeJung\n*Z = Zaozhuang Saehan\n*BW = China\n\nJapan\n\n*No letter or F = FujiGen\n*J or T = Terada\n\nCzech Republic\n\n*B = Boh\u00eamia Musico-Delicia\n\nIndonesia\n*CI = cort indonesia\n\n*SI = Samick Indonesia\n\nExample: SI09034853 SI = Samick Indonesia, 09 = 2009, 03 = March, 4853 = manufacturing number.\n\nYYMMFF12345\n\n*YY year\n*MM month\n*FF factory-code\n*12345 production#\n*FACTORY NUMBER CODES\u2014for some models starting in 2008, if serial # begins w/numbers\n*[NOTE: The factories identified by these codes are based on patterns that forum members have observed.

An image file format may store data in an uncompressed format, a compressed format (which may be lossless or lossy), or a [[vector graphics|vector]] format. Image [[Computer file|files]] are composed of digital data in one of these formats so that the data can be [[Raster graphics|rasterized]] for use on a computer display or printer. Rasterization converts the image data into a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a number of bits to designate its color (and in some formats, its transparency). Rasterizing an image file for a specific device takes into account the number of bits per pixel (the color depth) that the device is designed to handle.\n\n== Image file sizes ==\nThe size of raster image files is positively correlated with the number of pixels in the image and the color depth (bits per pixel).  Images can be compressed in various ways, however.  A compression [[algorithm]] stores either an exact representation or an approximation of the original image in a smaller number of bytes that can be expanded back to its uncompressed form with a corresponding decompression algorithm.  Images with the same number of pixels and color depth can have very different compressed file size.  Considering exactly the same compression, number of pixels, and color depth for two images, different graphical complexity of the original images may also result in very different file sizes after compression due to the nature of compression algorithms.  With some compression formats, images that are less complex may result in smaller compressed file sizes.  This characteristic sometimes results in a smaller file size for some lossless formats than lossy formats.  For example, graphically simple images (i.e. images with large continuous regions like line art or animation sequences) may be losslessly compressed into a GIF or PNG format and result in a smaller file size than a lossy JPEG format.\n\nFor example, a 640 * 480 pixel image with 24-bit color would occupy almost a megabyte of space:\n\n640 * 480 * 24\t= 7,372,800 bits&nbsp; = 921,600 bytes = 900 [[KiB]]\n\nWith vector images the file size increases only with the addition of more vectors.\n\n== Image file compression ==\nThere are two types of '''[[image file compression]]''' algorithms: [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] and [[Lossy compression|lossy]].\n\n'''Lossless compression''' algorithms reduce file size while preserving a perfect copy of the original uncompressed image.  Lossless compression generally, but not always, results in larger files than lossy compression.  Lossless compression should be used to avoid accumulating stages of re-compression when editing images.\n\n'''Lossy compression''' algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear to be a perfect copy, but it is not a perfect copy.  Often lossy compression is able to achieve smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  Most lossy compression algorithms allow for variable compression that trades image quality for file size.\n\n== Major graphic file formats ==\n{{See also|Comparison of graphics file formats#Technical details}}\nIncluding proprietary types, there are hundreds of image file types. The PNG, JPEG, and GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet. Some of these graphic formats are listed and briefly described below, separated into the two main families of graphics: raster and vector.\n\nIn addition to straight image formats, '''[[Metafile]]''' formats are portable formats which can include both raster and vector information. Examples are application-independent formats such as [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] and [[Enhanced Metafile|EMF]]. The metafile format is an intermediate format. Most applications open metafiles and then save them in their own native format. '''[[Page description language]]''' refers to formats used to describe the layout of a printed page containing text, objects and images. Examples are [[PostScript]], [[PDF]] and [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].\n\n=== Raster formats ===\n{{further|Raster graphics}}\n\n==== JPEG/JFIF ====\n[[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a [[lossy compression]] method; JPEG-compressed images are usually stored in the '''[[JFIF]]''' (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF [[filename extension]] is '''JPG''' or '''JPEG'''. Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, which supports eight-bit grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue).  JPEG applies lossy compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size.  Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result.  When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's quality, but JPEG files suffer [[Generation loss|generational degradation]] when repeatedly edited and saved. (JPEG also provides lossless image storage, but the lossless version is not widely supported.)\n\n==== JPEG 2000 ====\n[[JPEG 2000]] is a compression standard enabling both lossless and lossy storage. The compression methods used are different from the ones in standard JFIF/JPEG; they improve quality and compression ratios, but also require more computational power to process. JPEG 2000 also adds features that are missing in JPEG. It is not nearly as common as JPEG, but it is used currently in professional movie editing and distribution (some digital cinemas, for example, use JPEG 2000 for individual movie frames).\n\n====Exif====\nThe '''Exif''' ([[Exchangeable image file format]]) format is a file standard similar to the JFIF format with TIFF extensions; it is incorporated in the JPEG-writing software used in most cameras. Its purpose is to record and to standardize the exchange of images with [[image metadata]] between digital cameras and editing and viewing software. The metadata are recorded for individual images and include such things as camera settings, time and date, shutter speed, exposure, image size, compression, name of camera, color information. When images are viewed or edited by image editing software, all of this image information can be displayed.\n\nThe actual Exif metadata as such may be carried within different host formats, e.g. TIFF, JFIF (JPEG) or PNG. IFF-META is another example.\n\n====TIFF====\nThe '''TIFF''' ([[Tagged Image File Format]]) format is a flexible format usually using either the '''TIFF''' or '''TIF''' filename extension. The tagged structure was designed to be easily extendible, and many vendors have introduced proprietary special-purpose tags \u2013 with the result that no one reader handles every flavor of TIFF file. TIFFs can be lossy or lossless, depending on the technique chosen for storing the pixel data.  Some offer relatively good lossless compression for [[bi-level image|bi-level (black&white) images]]. Some digital cameras can save images in TIFF format, using the [[LZW]] compression algorithm for lossless storage. TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers. TIFF remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business. TIFF can handle device-specific color spaces, such as the [[CMYK]] defined by a particular set of printing press inks. [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] (Optical Character Recognition) software packages commonly generate some form of TIFF image (often [[Monochrome|monochromatic]]) for scanned text pages.\n\n==== GIF ====\nThe '''GIF''' ([[Graphics Interchange Format]]) is in normal use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is technically possible).<ref name=aminet>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web|url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archivedate=22 February 2015 }}</ref> GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW]] lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or [[dither]]ed images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.\n\n==== BMP ====\nThe '''[[BMP file format]]''' (Windows bitmap) handles graphic files within the Microsoft Windows OS. Typically, BMP files are uncompressed, and therefore large and lossless; their advantage is their simple structure and wide acceptance in Windows programs.\n\n==== PNG ====\nThe '''PNG''' ([[Portable Network Graphics]]) file format was created as a free, open-source alternative to GIF. The PNG file format supports eight-bit paletted images (with optional transparency for all palette colors) and 24-bit truecolor (16 million colors) or 48-bit truecolor with and without alpha channel - while GIF supports only 256 colors and a single transparent color. \n\nCompared to JPEG, PNG excels when the image has large, uniformly colored areas. Even for photographs \u2013 where JPEG is often the choice for final distribution since its compression technique typically yields smaller file sizes \u2013 PNG is still well-suited to storing images during the editing process because of its lossless compression.\n\nPNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF (though GIF is itself now patent-free), and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. The [[Adam7 algorithm|Adam7]] interlacing allows an early preview, even when only a small percentage of the image data has been transmitted. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms.\n\nPNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications like [[web browser]]s and can be fully streamed with a progressive display option. PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and simple detection of common transmission errors. \n\nAnimated formats derived from PNG are [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] and [[APNG]], which is backwards compatible with PNG and supported by most browsers.\n\n==== PPM, PGM, PBM, and PNM ====\n[[Netpbm format]] is a family including the '''portable pixmap''' file format (PPM), the '''portable graymap''' file format (PGM) and the '''portable bitmap''' file format (PBM). These are either pure [[ASCII]] files or raw binary files with an ASCII header that provide very basic functionality and serve as a lowest common denominator for converting pixmap, graymap, or bitmap files between different platforms. Several applications refer to them collectively as PNM (\"'''P'''ortable a'''N'''y '''M'''ap\").\n\n==== WebP ====\n[[WebP]] is a new open image format that uses both lossless and lossy compression. It was designed by Google to reduce image file size to speed up web page loading: its principal purpose is to supersede JPEG as the primary format for photographs on the web. WebP is based on [[VP8]]'s intra-frame coding and uses a container based on [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]].\n\n==== HDR raster formats ====\nMost typical raster formats cannot store [[High dynamic range imaging|HDR]] data (32 bit floating point values per pixel component), which is why some relatively old or complex formats are still predominant here, and worth mentioning separately. Newer alternatives are showing up, though. [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] is the format for HDR images originating from [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] and also supported by Adobe Photoshop. [[JPEG-HDR]] is a file format from Dolby Labs similar to RGBE encoding, standardized as JPEG XT Part 2. \n\n[[JPEG XT]] Part 7 includes support for encoding floating point HDR images in the base 8-bit JPEG file using enhancement layers encoded with four profiles (A-D); Profile A is based on the RGBE format and Profile B on the XDepth format from Trellis Management.\n\n==== HEIF ====\nThe [[High Efficiency Image File Format]] (HEIF) is an image container format that was standardized by [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] on the basis of the [[ISO base media file format]]. While HEIF can be used with any image compression format, the HEIF standard specifies the storage of [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] intra-coded images and HEVC-coded image sequences taking advantage of inter-picture prediction.\n\n==== BAT ====\nBAT was released into the public domain by C-Cube Microsystems. The \"official\" file format for JPEG files is SPIFF (Still Picture Interchange File Format), but by the time it was released, BAT had already achieved wide acceptance. SPIFF, which has the ISO designation 10918-3, offers more versatile compression, color management, and metadata capacity than JPEG/BAT, but it has little support. It may be superseded by JPEG 2000/DIG 2000: ISO SC29/WG1, JPEG - Information Links.

All [[computer graphics|graphical]] elements can be specified in a textual [[source file]] that can be compiled into a [[binary file]] or one of two text representations. CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D graphical information independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device.\nIt has been adopted to some extent in the areas of [[engineering drawing|technical illustration]] and professional [[Industrial design|design]], but has largely been superseded by formats such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]].\n\n==== Gerber format (RS-274X) ====\nThe [[Gerber format]] (aka Extended Gerber, RS-274X) was developed by Gerber Systems Corp., now [[Ucamco]], and is a 2D bi-level image description format.

The SVG format does not have a compression scheme of its own, but due to the textual nature of [[XML]], an SVG graphic can be compressed using a program<!--/algorithm/scheme?--> such as [[gzip]].

An image file format may store data in an uncompressed format, a compressed format (which may be lossless or lossy), or a [[vector graphics|vector]] format. Image [[Computer file|files]] are composed of digital data in one of these formats so that the data can be [[Raster graphics|rasterized]] for use on a computer display or printer. Rasterization converts the image data into a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a number of bits to designate its color (and in some formats, its transparency). Rasterizing an image file for a specific device takes into account the number of bits per pixel (the color depth) that the device is designed to handle.\n\n== Image file sizes ==\nThe size of raster image files is positively correlated with the number of pixels in the image and the color depth (bits per pixel).  Images can be compressed in various ways, however.  A compression [[algorithm]] stores either an exact representation or an approximation of the original image in a smaller number of bytes that can be expanded back to its uncompressed form with a corresponding decompression algorithm.  Images with the same number of pixels and color depth can have very different compressed file size.  Considering exactly the same compression, number of pixels, and color depth for two images, different graphical complexity of the original images may also result in very different file sizes after compression due to the nature of compression algorithms.  With some compression formats, images that are less complex may result in smaller compressed file sizes.  This characteristic sometimes results in a smaller file size for some lossless formats than lossy formats.  For example, graphically simple images (i.e. images with large continuous regions like line art or animation sequences) may be losslessly compressed into a GIF or PNG format and result in a smaller file size than a lossy JPEG format.\n\nFor example, a 640 * 480 pixel image with 24-bit color would occupy almost a megabyte of space:\n\n640 * 480 * 24\t= 7,372,800 bits&nbsp; = 921,600 bytes = 900 [[KiB]]\n\nWith vector images the file size increases only with the addition of more vectors.\n\n== Image file compression ==\nThere are two types of '''[[image file compression]]''' algorithms: [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] and [[Lossy compression|lossy]].\n\n'''Lossless compression''' algorithms reduce file size while preserving a perfect copy of the original uncompressed image.  Lossless compression generally, but not always, results in larger files than lossy compression.  Lossless compression should be used to avoid accumulating stages of re-compression when editing images.\n\n'''Lossy compression''' algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear to be a perfect copy, but it is not a perfect copy.  Often lossy compression is able to achieve smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  Most lossy compression algorithms allow for variable compression that trades image quality for file size.\n\n== Major graphic file formats ==\n{{See also|Comparison of graphics file formats#Technical details}}\nIncluding proprietary types, there are hundreds of image file types. The PNG, JPEG, and GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet. Some of these graphic formats are listed and briefly described below, separated into the two main families of graphics: raster and vector.\n\nIn addition to straight image formats, '''[[Metafile]]''' formats are portable formats which can include both raster and vector information. Examples are application-independent formats such as [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] and [[Enhanced Metafile|EMF]]. The metafile format is an intermediate format. Most applications open metafiles and then save them in their own native format. '''[[Page description language]]''' refers to formats used to describe the layout of a printed page containing text, objects and images. Examples are [[PostScript]], [[PDF]] and [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].\n\n=== Raster formats ===\n{{further|Raster graphics}}\n\n==== JPEG/JFIF ====\n[[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a [[lossy compression]] method; JPEG-compressed images are usually stored in the '''[[JFIF]]''' (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF [[filename extension]] is '''JPG''' or '''JPEG'''. Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, which supports eight-bit grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue).  JPEG applies lossy compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size.  Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result.  When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's quality, but JPEG files suffer [[Generation loss|generational degradation]] when repeatedly edited and saved. (JPEG also provides lossless image storage, but the lossless version is not widely supported.)\n\n==== JPEG 2000 ====\n[[JPEG 2000]] is a compression standard enabling both lossless and lossy storage. The compression methods used are different from the ones in standard JFIF/JPEG; they improve quality and compression ratios, but also require more computational power to process. JPEG 2000 also adds features that are missing in JPEG. It is not nearly as common as JPEG, but it is used currently in professional movie editing and distribution (some digital cinemas, for example, use JPEG 2000 for individual movie frames).\n\n====Exif====\nThe '''Exif''' ([[Exchangeable image file format]]) format is a file standard similar to the JFIF format with TIFF extensions; it is incorporated in the JPEG-writing software used in most cameras. Its purpose is to record and to standardize the exchange of images with [[image metadata]] between digital cameras and editing and viewing software. The metadata are recorded for individual images and include such things as camera settings, time and date, shutter speed, exposure, image size, compression, name of camera, color information. When images are viewed or edited by image editing software, all of this image information can be displayed.\n\nThe actual Exif metadata as such may be carried within different host formats, e.g. TIFF, JFIF (JPEG) or PNG. IFF-META is another example.\n\n====TIFF====\nThe '''TIFF''' ([[Tagged Image File Format]]) format is a flexible format usually using either the '''TIFF''' or '''TIF''' filename extension. The tagged structure was designed to be easily extendible, and many vendors have introduced proprietary special-purpose tags \u2013 with the result that no one reader handles every flavor of TIFF file.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  TIFFs can be lossy or lossless, depending on the technique chosen for storing the pixel data.  Some offer relatively good lossless compression for [[bi-level image|bi-level (black&white) images]]. Some digital cameras can save images in TIFF format, using the [[LZW]] compression algorithm for lossless storage. TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers. TIFF remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business. TIFF can handle device-specific color spaces, such as the [[CMYK]] defined by a particular set of printing press inks. [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] (Optical Character Recognition) software packages commonly generate some form of TIFF image (often [[Monochrome|monochromatic]]) for scanned text pages.\n\n==== GIF ====\nThe '''GIF''' ([[Graphics Interchange Format]]) is in normal use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is technically possible).<ref name=aminet>{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web|url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archivedate=22 February 2015 }}</ref> GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW]] lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or [[dither]]ed images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.\n\n==== BMP ====\nThe '''[[BMP file format]]''' (Windows bitmap) handles graphic files within the Microsoft Windows OS.

CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D graphical information independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device.\nIt has been adopted to some extent in the areas of [[engineering drawing|technical illustration]] and professional [[Industrial design|design]], but has largely been superseded by formats such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]].\n\n==== Gerber format (RS-274X) ====\nThe [[Gerber format]] (aka Extended Gerber, RS-274X) was developed by Gerber Systems Corp., now [[Ucamco]], and is a 2D bi-level image description format. It is the de facto standard format used by [[printed circuit board]] or PCB software. It is also widely used in other industries requiring high-precision 2D bi-level images.<ref name=\"Gerber spec\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucamco.com/en/guest/downloads|title=Gerber File Format Specification|publisher=Ucamco}}</ref>\n\n==== SVG ====\nSVG ([[Scalable Vector Graphics]]) is an [[open standard]] created and developed by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] to address the need (and attempts of several corporations) for a versatile, [[DOM scripting|scriptable]] and all-purpose vector format for the web and otherwise. The SVG format does not have a compression scheme of its own, but due to the textual nature of [[XML]], an SVG graphic can be compressed using a program<!--/algorithm/scheme?--> such as [[gzip]]. Because of its scripting potential, SVG is a key component in [[web application]]s: interactive web pages that look and act like applications.\n\n==== Other 2D vector formats ====\n* AFDesign ([[Affinity Designer]] document)\n*AI ([[Adobe Illustrator Artwork]])\n* CDR ([[CorelDRAW]])\n*[[DrawingML]]\n* GEM metafiles (interpreted and written by the [[Graphics Environment Manager]] VDI subsystem)\n*[[Graphics Layout Engine]]\n*[[HPGL]], introduced on [[Hewlett-Packard]] plotters, but generalized into a printer language\n* HVIF ([[Haiku Vector Icon Format]])\n*[[MathML]]\n*[[NAPLPS]] (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax)\n* ODG ([[OpenDocument Graphics]])\n* !DRAW, a native vector graphic format (in several backward compatible versions) for the [[RISC-OS]] computer system begun by Acorn in the mid-1980s and still present on that platform today\n*[[Precision Graphics Markup Language]], a [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] submission that was not adopted as a [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]].\n*[[PSTricks]] and [[PGF/TikZ]] are languages for creating graphics in [[TeX]] documents.\n* QCC, used by Quilt Manager by [http://quiltez.com Quilt EZ] for designing quilts.\n*[[ReGIS]], used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[computer terminal]]s\n*[[Remote imaging protocol]]\n* VML ([[Vector Markup Language]])\n*[[Xar (graphics)|Xar]] format used in vector applications from [[Xara]]\n* XPS ([[XML Paper Specification]])\n\n==== 3D vector formats ====\n* [[Additive Manufacturing File Format|AMF]] - Additive Manufacturing File Format\n*[[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] - A language that lifts TeX to 3D.\n*[[.blend#File format|.blend]] - Blender\n*[[COLLADA]]\n*.dgn\n*[[.dwf]]\n*[[.dwg]]\n*[[.dxf]]\n*eDrawings\n*[[.flt]] - [[OpenFlight]]\n*[[FVRML]] - and FX3D, function-based extensions of VRML and X3D\n*HSF\n*[[IGES]]\n*IMML - Immersive Media Markup Language\n*IPA\n*[[JT (visualization format)|JT]]\n*.MA (Maya ASCII format)\n*.MB (Maya Binary format)\n*.OBJ [[Wavefront .obj file|Wavefront]]\n*[[OpenGEX]] - Open Game Engine Exchange\n*[[PLY]]\n*[[POV-Ray]] scene description language\n*[[PRC (File format)|PRC]]\n*[[ISO 10303|STEP]]\n*[[SketchUp|SKP]]\n*[[STL (file format)|STL]] - A stereolithography format\n*[[U3D]] - Universal 3D file format\n*[[VRML]] - Virtual Reality Modeling Language\n*[[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]]\n*XGL\n*[[XVL]]\n*[[xVRML]]\n*[[X3D]]\n*.3D\n*3DF\n*.3DM\n* [[.3ds]] - Autodesk 3D Studio\n*[[3DXML]]\n*X3D - Vector format used in 3D applications from [[Xara]]\n\n=== Compound formats ===\n{{see also|Metafile}}\n\nThese are formats containing both pixel and vector data, possible other data, e.g. the interactive features of PDF.\n*EPS ([[Encapsulated PostScript]])\n*PDF ([[Portable Document Format]])\n*[[PostScript]], a [[page description language]] with strong graphics capabilities\n*[[PICT]] (Classic Macintosh QuickDraw file)\n* WMF / EMF ([[Windows Metafile]] / Enhanced Metafile)\n*[[SWF]] (Shockwave Flash)\n*[[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] User interface language using vector graphics for images.\n\n=== Stereo formats ===\n* MPO The [[JPEG#JPEG_Multi-Picture_Format|Multi Picture Object]] (.mpo) format consists of multiple JPEG images ([[Camera & Imaging Products Association]]) (CIPA).\n* PNS The PNG Stereo (.pns) format consists of a side-by-side image based on PNG ([[Portable Network Graphics]]).\n* JPS The [[JPEG Stereo]] (.jps) format consists of a side-by-side image format based on [[JPEG]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Graphics file formats}}\n\n[[Category:Graphics file formats|*]]\n[[Category:Lists of file formats]]\n[[Category:Vector graphics markup languages]]\n", "name_user": "Moiikke", "label": "safe", "comment": "Why would you need a citation for that?
