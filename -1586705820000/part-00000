''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.</ref> The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Trever, John C. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.</ref> The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, \"Kando\", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\">{{cite book|first1=James |last1=VanderKam|first2=Peter|last2=Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2|page=5}}</ref> The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)\n\nIn 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of the [[Nash Papyrus]], the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.\n\n===Search for the Qumran caves (1948\u20131949)===\nEarly in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop [[Mar Samuel]] brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1949, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.<ref>{{cite web |first = Frantisek |last=Trstensky|title=The Archaeological Site of Qumran and the Personality of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949\u20131951)===\n[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]\nThe rediscovery of what became known as \"Cave 1\" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].<ref>VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.</ref> The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.<ref name=\"biblicaltheology.com\">{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.<ref>{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7727/|title=The Qumran paradigm: A critical evaluation of some foundational hypotheses in the construction of the 'Qumran Sect.|last=De-Looijer|first=G.

M.|publisher=PhD Thesis, Durham University|year=2013|pages=1\u201313|type=Doctoral}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran\u2013Essene theory===\n{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}\nThe view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the \"Qumran\u2013Essene\" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Gu\u00e9rin de Vaux]]<ref>de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> and [[J\u00f3zef Milik|J\u00f3zef Tadeusz Milik]],<ref>Milik, J\u00f3zef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.</ref> though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.<ref>For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.</ref> The Qumran\u2013Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.\nA number of arguments are used to support this theory.\n* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] \u2013 a Jewish\u2013Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.\n* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.\n* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the \"[[scriptorium]]\" based upon this discovery.\n* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.\n* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].\n\n===Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory===\nQumran\u2013Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran\u2013Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran\u2013Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.\n\nA specific variation on the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H.

Most of the longer, more complete scrolls were published soon after their discovery. All the writings in Cave 1 appeared in print between 1950 and 1956; those from eight other caves were released in 1963; and 1965 saw the publication of the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11. Their translations into English soon followed.\n\n==== Controversy ====\nPublication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy. The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by [[John Strugnell]], while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as [[Norman Golb]], publishers and writers such as [[Hershel Shanks]], and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the \"Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls\", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&slug=1306832 |title=Copies of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public \u2013 Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=22 September 1991}}</ref> In 1991 [[Emanuel Tov]] was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.\n\n====Physical description====\nThe majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow.

The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on \"REDATING\"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2014}}</ref> This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.\n\nAccording to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, <blockquote>Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word \"light,\" which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref></blockquote>It is important to note that differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.<!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay \"A.D. 100\" as quoted --><ref>Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the \"Dead sea scrolls\", Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.\n\nTo quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''<blockquote>In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... </blockquote><blockquote>Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, \"We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|location=Chicago|pages=65}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Biblical books found===\nThere are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.<ref name=\"AbeggFlint2012\"/><ref>Abegg et al. \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English.\" 1999.</ref> The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]].

Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works to digitize the scrolls and place them in permanent cold storage.\n\nThe majority of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection was moved to Jerusalem's [[Shrine of the Book]] (a part of the Israel Museum) after the building's completion in April 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898691,00.html|title=Art: Endless Cave in Jerusalem|date=30 April 1965|journal=Time}}</ref> The museum falls under the auspices of the Israel Antiquities Authority, an official agency of the Israeli government.

That third party, [[George Isha'ya]], was a member of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who soon contacted [[Saint Mark Monastery of Jerusalem|St Mark's Monastery]] in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as [[Mar Samuel]]. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous ''Isaiah Scroll'' ([[1QIs-a|1QIsa<sup>a</sup>]]), the ''[[Community Rule]]'', the ''[[Habakkuk Commentary|Habakkuk Pesher]]'' (a commentary on the book of [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]]), and the ''[[Genesis Apocryphon]]''. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>b</sup>).\n\nFour of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York.

This ambiguity arises from differences in [[copyright]] law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.\n\nIn 1992 a copyright case ''[[Qimron v. Shanks]]'' was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar [[Elisha Qimron]] against [[Hershel Shanks]] of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' which were included without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\">{{cite web |last=Nimmer |first=David |work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923111121/http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&field=per&match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.\n\nThe court's ruling not only affirms that the \"deciphered text\" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], \"freedom\" in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Hebrew writings]]\n* [[Cairo Geniza]]\n* [[Jordan Lead Codices]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]\n* [[Teacher of Righteousness]]\n* [[The Book of Mysteries]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive |title = Leon Levy Collection|website = Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library |publisher = [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] |access-date = 22 January 2015 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\":0\">OakTree Software, Inc.

''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.</ref> The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Trever, John C. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.</ref> The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, \"Kando\", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\">{{cite book|first1=James |last1=VanderKam|first2=Peter|last2=Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2|page=5}}</ref> The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)\n\nIn 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of the [[Nash Papyrus]], the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.\n\n===Search for the Qumran caves (1948\u20131949)===\nEarly in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop [[Mar Samuel]] brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1949, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.<ref>{{cite web |first = Frantisek |last=Trstensky|title=The Archaeological Site of Qumran and the Personality of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949\u20131951)===\n[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]\nThe rediscovery of what became known as \"Cave 1\" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].<ref>VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.</ref> The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.<ref name=\"biblicaltheology.com\">{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.<ref>{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7727/|title=The Qumran paradigm: A critical evaluation of some foundational hypotheses in the construction of the 'Qumran Sect.|last=De-Looijer|first=G.

M.|publisher=PhD Thesis, Durham University|year=2013|pages=1\u201313|type=Doctoral}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran\u2013Essene theory===\n{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}\nThe view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the \"Qumran\u2013Essene\" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Gu\u00e9rin de Vaux]]<ref>de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> and [[J\u00f3zef Milik|J\u00f3zef Tadeusz Milik]],<ref>Milik, J\u00f3zef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.</ref> though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.<ref>For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.</ref> The Qumran\u2013Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.\nA number of arguments are used to support this theory.\n* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] \u2013 a Jewish\u2013Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.\n* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.\n* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the \"[[scriptorium]]\" based upon this discovery.\n* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.\n* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].\n\n===Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory===\nQumran\u2013Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran\u2013Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran\u2013Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.\n\nA specific variation on the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H. Schiffman]], who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests ([[Sadducees]]).<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H., ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: their True Meaning for Judaism and Christianity'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (Doubleday) 1995.</ref> The most important document in support of this view is the \"[[4QMMT|Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah]]\" ([[4QMMT]]), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. [[4QMMT]] also reproduces a festival calendar that follows [[Sadducee]] principles for the dating of certain festival days.\n\n===Christian origin theory===\n[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jos\u00e9 O'Callaghan Mart\u00ednez]] argued in the 1960s that one fragment ([[7Q5]]) preserves a portion of text from the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:52\u201353.<ref>O'Callaghan\u2013Mart\u00ednez, Josep, ''Cartas Cristianas Griegas del Siglo V'', Barcelona: E. Balmes, 1963.</ref> This theory was [[Falsifiability|falsified]] in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment.<ref>Enste, Stefan. (2000). ''Kein Markustext in Qumran: Eine Untersuchung der These; Qumran-Fragment 7Q5 = Mk 6, 52\u201353 (No Mark text: an enquiry of the thesis; Qumran fragment 7Q5 = Gospel of Mark 6: 52\u201353)''. G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. {{ISBN|978-3-525-53945-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Eisenman]] has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the [[early Christian]] community. Eisenman also argued that the careers of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.<ref>Eisenman, Robert H. J''ames, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1st American ed. New York: Viking, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Jerusalem origin theory===\nSome scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of [[Judaism|Jews]] living in [[Jerusalem]], who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE.<ref>Chernoivanenko, Vitaly. \"[http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf The Jerusalem Theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls Authorship: Origins, Evolution, and Discussions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215902/http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf |date=17 March 2016 }},\" in ''Ukrainian Orientalistics: Special Issue on Jewish Studies'', \u041ayiv: NaUKMA Omeljan Pritsak Center for Oriental Studies, 2011: 9\u201329.</ref> Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>Rengstorf, Karl Heinrich.

The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.</ref> Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]<ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2004.</ref> and more recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg,<ref>{{cite web |first1=Magen|last1= Yizhak |first2= Yuval |last2=Peleg |title=The Qumran Excavations 1993\u20132004: Preliminary Report'', JSP 6 |publisher=Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority |year=2007 |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/images/shop/jsp/JSP6_Qumran_color.pdf }}</ref> who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a [[Hasmonean]] fort that was reused during later periods.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:7Q6-1,2.png|thumb|right|Fragments 1 and 2 of '7Q6' from Cave 7 are written on papyrus.]]\n\n===Radiocarbon dating===\n{{Main|Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls}}\nParchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]]. The initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves.

The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on \"REDATING\"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2014}}</ref> This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.\n\nAccording to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, <blockquote>Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word \"light,\" which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref></blockquote>It is important to note that differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.<!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay \"A.D. 100\" as quoted --><ref>Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the \"Dead sea scrolls\", Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.\n\nTo quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''<blockquote>In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... </blockquote><blockquote>Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, \"We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|location=Chicago|pages=65}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Biblical books found===\nThere are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.<ref name=\"AbeggFlint2012\"/><ref>Abegg et al. \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English.\" 1999.</ref> The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]].

More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>b</sup>).\n\nFour of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York.

This ambiguity arises from differences in [[copyright]] law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.\n\nIn 1992 a copyright case ''[[Qimron v. Shanks]]'' was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar [[Elisha Qimron]] against [[Hershel Shanks]] of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' which were included without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\">{{cite web |last=Nimmer |first=David |work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923111121/http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&field=per&match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.\n\nThe court's ruling not only affirms that the \"deciphered text\" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], \"freedom\" in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Hebrew writings]]\n* [[Cairo Geniza]]\n* [[Jordan Lead Codices]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]\n* [[Teacher of Righteousness]]\n* [[The Book of Mysteries]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive |title = Leon Levy Collection|website = Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library |publisher = [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] |access-date = 22 January 2015 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\":0\">OakTree Software, Inc.

Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\n=== Hollywood ===\n{{see|Cinema of the United States}}\n\nThe first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move west.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].\n\nThe [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest. The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].\n\nThe first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\n=== Bollywood ===\n{{Main|Bollywood}}\n\n[[File:A scene from film, Raja Harishchandra, 1913.jpg|thumb|A shot from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first film of [[Bollywood]].]]\n[[Bollywood]] is the [[Hindi]]-language film industry based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), [[Maharashtra]], India.

The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker [[Nasir Hussain]],<ref>{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> along with screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], pioneering the Bollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] format.<ref name=\"Chaudhuri58\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\n{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}\n\nProfitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n=== Largest industries by number of film productions ===\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web |title=UIS Statistics |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?ReportId=5538 |website=[[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of \"Kathmandu\" and \"Hollywood\"; \"Kollywood\" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing film of all time in Nepali film industry and Kohinoor the second highest. The Nepali films [[The Black Hen]] (2015) and [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) received international acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) received the Best Film award at the 27th [[Singapore International Film Festival]] (SGIFF) in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n<!--[[History of the film industry]] redirects here-->\n{{main|History of film}}\n[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Still frame|still]] from ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (Australia, 1906; 80&nbsp;min.)]]\nLes fr\u00e8res Lumi\u00e8re released the first projection with the Cinematograph, in Paris on 28 December 1895. The French film industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the world's most important. Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cin\u00e9matographe and their L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.\nThe first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\n=== Hollywood ===\n{{see|Cinema of the United States}}\n\nThe first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move west.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].\n\nThe [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest. The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].\n\nThe first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\n=== Bollywood ===\n{{Main|Bollywood}}\n\n[[File:A scene from film, Raja Harishchandra, 1913.jpg|thumb|A shot from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first film of [[Bollywood]].]]\n[[Bollywood]] is the [[Hindi]]-language film industry based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), [[Maharashtra]], India.

The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker [[Nasir Hussain]],<ref>{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> along with screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], pioneering the Bollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] format.<ref name=\"Chaudhuri58\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\n{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}\n\nProfitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n=== Largest industries by number of film productions ===\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web |title=UIS Statistics |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?ReportId=5538 |website=[[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It is currently composed of twelve teams. The league was founded on April 22, 1996, as the women's counterpart to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and league play started in 1997. The regular season is played from May to September, with the All Star game being played midway through the season in July (except in [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] years) and the [[WNBA Finals]] at the end of September until the beginning of October. Starting in 2020, a midseason tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, will be added. Initially, regular-season Cup games were to be played through early July, followed by a final match in August. This schedule is subject to change due to disruptions from the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nFive WNBA teams have direct NBA counterparts and play in the same arena: [[Indiana Fever]], [[Los Angeles Sparks]], [[Minnesota Lynx]], [[New York Liberty]], and [[Phoenix Mercury]]. The [[Atlanta Dream]], [[Chicago Sky]], [[Connecticut Sun]], [[Dallas Wings]], [[Las Vegas Aces]],  [[Seattle Storm]], and [[Washington Mystics]] do not share an arena with a direct NBA counterpart, although four of the seven (the Dream, the Sky, the Wings, and the Mystics) share a market with an NBA counterpart, and the Storm shared an arena and market with an NBA team at the time of its founding. The Dream, the Sky, the Sun, the Wings, the Aces, the Sparks, and the Storm are all independently owned.\n\n==History==\n===League founded and play begins (1996\u201397)===\nThe creation of the WNBA was officially approved by the NBA Board of Governors on April 22, 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/history/|title=History \u2013 WNBA.com |website=WNBA.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> and announced at a press conference with [[Rebecca Lobo]], [[Lisa Leslie]], and [[Sheryl Swoopes]] in attendance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/original-three-lisa-leslie-sheryl-swoopes-rebecca-lobo-wnba-draft/|title=Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Rebecca Lobo Reunited at WNBA Draft|website=WNBA.com \u2013 Official Site of the WNBA|language=English|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> The new WNBA had to compete with the recently formed [[American Basketball League (1996\u201398)|American Basketball League]], another professional women's basketball league that began play in the fall of 1996 but would cease operation during its 1998\u201399 season.\n\nThe WNBA began with eight teams: the [[Charlotte Sting]], [[Cleveland chefs]], [[Houston Comets]], and [[New York Liberty]] in the Eastern Conference; and the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], [[Phoenix Mercury]], [[Sacramento Monarchs]], and [[Utah Starzz]] in the Western Conference.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/about_us/historyof_wnba.html|title=WNBA.com: History of the WNBA|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile not the first major women's professional basketball league in the United States (a distinction held by the defunct [[Women's Pro Basketball League|WBL]]), the WNBA is the only league to receive full backing of the NBA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/10382007/wnba-nba-commissioner-david-stern-changed-women-basketball|title=Voepel: Stern changed women's basketball|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> The WNBA logo, \"Logo Woman\", paralleled the NBA logo and was selected out of 50 different designs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the heels of a much-publicized gold medal run by the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] USA Basketball Women's National Team at the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympic Games]], the WNBA began its first season on June 21, 1997 to little fanfare. The first WNBA game featured the [[New York Liberty]] facing the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The game was televised nationally in the United States on the [[NBC]] television network. At the start of the 1997 season, the WNBA had television deals in place with NBC (NBA rights holder), and the [[Walt Disney Company]] and [[Hearst Corporation]] joint venture channels, [[ESPN]] and [[Lifetime Television]] Network, respectively. [[Penny Toler]] scored the league's first point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=16261693|title=Penny Toler recalls landmark WNBA basket \u2013 ESPN Video|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/about_us/wnba_history_timeline_2012_04_30.html|title=WNBA.com: WNBA History/Timeline|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Houston domination and league expansion (1997\u20132000)===\n\nThe WNBA centered its marketing campaign, dubbed \"We Got Next\", around stars [[Rebecca Lobo]], [[Lisa Leslie]], and [[Sheryl Swoopes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/16256278/twenty-years-later-look-back-wnba-first-game|title=Twenty years later, a look back at WNBA's first game|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> In the league's first season, Leslie's Los Angeles Sparks underperformed, and Swoopes sat out much of the season due to her pregnancy.

We expect to keep growing the league.\"<ref>[http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1999/06/8/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/WNBA-EXPANDS-BY-FOUR-ARE-MORE-CITIES-ON-THE-HORIZON.aspx \"WNBA EXPANDS BY FOUR ... ARE MORE CITIES ON THE HORIZON?\"], Sports Business Daily, June 8, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the league's chief competition, the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|American Basketball League]], folded. Many of the ABL's star players, including several Olympic gold medalists (such as [[Nikki McCray]] and [[Dawn Staley]]) and a number of standout college performers (including [[Kate Starbird]] and [[Jennifer Rizzotti]]), then joined the rosters of WNBA teams and, in so doing, enhanced the overall quality of play in the league. When a lockout resulted in an abbreviated NBA season, the WNBA saw faltering TV viewership.\n\nOn May 23, 2000, the [[Houston Comets]] became the first WNBA team to be invited to the [[White House Rose Garden]]. Before this invitation, only men's sports teams had traveled to the White House.\n\nAt the end of the 2000 season, the [[Houston Comets]] won their fourth championship, capturing every title since the league's inception. Led by the \"Big Three\" of [[Sheryl Swoopes]], [[Tina Thompson]], and four-time [[WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]] [[Cynthia Cooper-Dyke|Cynthia Cooper]], the Comets dominated every team in the league. Under head coach [[Van Chancellor]], the team posted a 98\u201324 record through their first four seasons (16\u20133 in the [[WNBA Playoffs|Playoffs]]). After 2000, Cooper retired from the league, and the Comets' dynasty came to an end.\n\n===The L.A. Sparks; new league ownership and contraction (2001\u20132002)===\n[[File:LisaLeslieDec10.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Lisa Leslie of the Sparks]]\nThe top contender in the 2001 season was the [[Los Angeles Sparks]]. Led by [[Lisa Leslie]], the Sparks posted a regular-season record of 28\u20134. They advanced to their first ever [[WNBA Finals]] and swept the [[Charlotte Sting]].\n\nLooking to repeat in 2002, the Sparks again made a strong run toward the postseason, going 25\u20137 in the regular season under head coach [[Michael Cooper]], formerly of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Again, Leslie dominated opponents throughout the Playoffs, leading the Sparks to a perfect 6\u20130 record through all three rounds, beating the [[New York Liberty]] in the [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002 Finals]].\n\nTeams and the league were collectively owned by the NBA until the end of 2002, when the NBA sold WNBA teams either to their NBA counterparts in the same city or to a third party, as a result of the [[dot-com bubble]]. This led to two teams moving: Utah moved to [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio]], and Orlando moved to [[Connecticut Sun|Connecticut]] and became the first WNBA team to be owned by a third party instead of an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] franchise. This sale of teams also led to two teams folding, the [[Miami Sol]] and [[Portland Fire]], because new owners could not be found.\n\n===Bill Laimbeer leaves his mark (2003\u20132006)===\nThe WNBA Players Association threatened to strike in 2003 if a new deal was not worked out between players and the league. The result was a delay in the start of the 2003 preseason. The [[2003 WNBA Draft]] was also delayed and negative publicity was gained from this strike.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/16/sports/basketball/y16wnba.html |title=W.N.B.A., Going on 7, Has Grown-Up Labor Dispute |date=April 16, 2003 |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking over a struggling franchise in 2002, former [[Detroit Pistons]] forward [[Bill Laimbeer]] had high hopes for the [[Detroit Shock]] in 2003. The team was just 9\u201323 in 2002. The Shock had three all-stars in the [[2003 WNBA All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] ([[Swin Cash]], [[Cheryl Ford]], and [[Deanna Nolan]]). Laimbeer orchestrated a worst-to-first turnaround and the Shock finished the season 25\u20139 in first place in the Eastern Conference. Winning the first two rounds of the Playoffs, the Shock faced two-time champion [[Los Angeles Sparks]] and [[Lisa Leslie]] in the [[2003 WNBA Finals|2003 Finals]]. The Shock beat the Sparks, winning game three on a three-pointer by [[Deanna Nolan]].\n\n[[File:Bill Laimbeer.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.5|Bill Laimbeer]]\nAfter the [[2003 WNBA season|2003 season]], the [[Cleveland Rockers]], one of the league's original eight teams, folded because the owners were unwilling to continue operating the franchise.\n\n[[Val Ackerman]], the first WNBA president, resigned effective February 1, 2005, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. Ackerman later became president of [[USA Basketball]]. On February 15, 2005, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that [[Donna Orender]], who had been serving as the Senior Vice President of the [[PGA Tour]] and who had played for several teams in the now-defunct [[Women's Pro Basketball League]], would be Ackerman's successor as of April 2005.\n\nThe WNBA awarded an [[expansion team]] to [[Chicago]] (later named the [[Chicago Sky|Sky]]) in February 2006. In the off-season, a set of rule changes was approved that made the WNBA more like the NBA.<ref name=2006rules>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/rulechanges_051206.html|title=WNBA official 2006 rule changes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the league became the first team-oriented women's professional sports league to exist for ten consecutive seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/about_us/wnba_history_timeline_2012_04_30.html|title=WNBA.com: WNBA History/Timeline|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> On the occasion of the tenth anniversary, the WNBA released its [[WNBA's All-Decade Team|All-Decade Team]], comprising the ten WNBA players to have contributed, through on-court play and off-court activities, the most to women's basketball during the league's existence.\n\nAfter missing out on the Finals in 2004 and 2005, the Shock bounced back in 2006 behind newly acquired [[Katie Smith]], along with six remaining members from their 2003 Finals run ([[Swin Cash|Cash]], [[Cheryl Ford|Ford]], [[Kedra Holland-Corn|Holland-Corn]], [[Deanna Nolan|Nolan]], [[Elaine Powell|Powell]], and [[Ruth Riley|Riley]]). The Shock finished second in the Eastern Conference and knocked off first-seeded [[Connecticut Sun|Connecticut]] in the second round of the Playoffs. The Shock faced reigning champion [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in a five-game series. The Shock won game five on their home floor.\n\n===Bringing \"Paul Ball\" to the WNBA (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Taurasi 07.25.07.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.55|Diana Taurasi of the Mercury]]\nIn December 2006, the [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]] organization announced it would no longer operate the [[Charlotte Sting]]. Soon after, the WNBA announced that the Sting would not operate for 2007. A [[2007 WNBA Draft#Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] was held on January 8, 2007. Teams selected in inverse order of their 2006 records; [[Chicago Sky|Chicago]] received the first pick.\n\nFormer [[Los Angeles Lakers]] championship coach [[Paul Westhead]] was named head coach of the [[Phoenix Mercury]] on October 11, 2005, bringing his up-tempo style of play to the WNBA. This fast-paced offense was perfect for his team, especially after the league shortened the shot clock from 30 seconds to 24 seconds in 2006. Much like the early [[Houston Comets]] championship teams, the [[Phoenix Mercury]] had risen to prominence led by their own \"Big Three\" of [[Cappie Pondexter]], [[Diana Taurasi]], and [[Penny Taylor]].\n\nThe Mercury was well-suited for the fast offense behind these three players. Phoenix averaged a league-record 88.97 points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the new style of play, and the Mercury were propelled into first place in the Western Conference. Facing the reigning champion [[Detroit Shock]], the Mercury imposed their high-scoring offense with hopes of capturing their first title in franchise history. Averaging 93.2 points per game in the [[2007 WNBA Finals|Finals series]], the Mercury beat Detroit on their home floor in front of 22,076 fans in game five to claim their first-ever WNBA title.\n\nIn October 2007 the WNBA awarded another expansion franchise to [[Atlanta]]. Atlanta businessman Ron Terwilliger was the original owner of the new team.

The team posted a 16\u201318 record and became the first team in WNBA history to miss the Playoffs after winning the championship in the previous season. In their place, the [[Detroit Shock]] won their third championship under coach [[Bill Laimbeer]], solidifying their place in WNBA history before Laimbeer resigned early in 2009, effectively ending the Shock dynasty.\n\nDuring the 2008 regular season, the first-ever outdoor professional basketball game in North America was played at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/sports/basketball/20liberty.html|title=Liberty Has Its Moment in History, if Not a Victory|last=Robbins|first=Liz|date=2008-07-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The First Regular Season Outdoor Game in Professional Basketball History|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/liberty/news/outdoor_classic_2008.html|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the [[New York Liberty]] 71\u201355 in front of over 19,000 fans.\n\nLate in 2008, the WNBA took over ownership of one of the league's original franchises, the [[Houston Comets]]. The Comets ceased operations on December 1, 2008, after no owners for the franchise could be found.<ref name=\"WNBA shutting down league-owned Comets\">[http://sports.espn.go.com/wnba/news/story?id=3738040 Comets To Cease Operations] from ESPN.com</ref> A dispersal draft took place on December 8, 2008, and with the first pick, [[Sancho Lyttle]] was taken by the [[Atlanta Dream]].\n\nAfter an unsatisfying conclusion in 2008, the Mercury looked to bounce back to championship caliber. New head coach [[Corey Gaines]] implemented [[Paul Westhead]]'s style of play, and the Mercury averaged 92.82 points per game throughout the 2009 season. Helped by the return of [[Penny Taylor]], the Mercury once again locked up first place in the Western Conference and advanced to the [[2009 WNBA Finals|2009 Finals]]. The championship series was a battle of contrasting styles as the Mercury (number one league offense, 92.82 points per game) had to face the [[Indiana Fever]] (number three league defense, 73.55 points per game). The series went five games, including arguably one of the most thrilling games in WNBA history in game one of the series (Phoenix won in overtime, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091003043152/http://www.wnba.com/games/20090929/INDPHO/boxscore.html 120\u2013116]. The Mercury beat the Fever in game five, this time on their home court, to capture their second WNBA championship.\n\nNot only did Paul Westhead's system influence his Mercury team, but it created a domino effect throughout the league. Young athletic players were capable of scoring more and playing at a faster pace. As a league, the 2010 average of 80.35 points per game was the best, far surpassing the 69.2 average in the league's [[1997 WNBA season|inaugural season]].\n\n===Changing of the guard (2010\u20132012)===\n[[File:Sylvia Fowles WNBA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Sylvia Fowles of the Sky]]\nOn October 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the [[Detroit Shock]] would relocate to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]; the team is called the [[Tulsa Shock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/wnba/news/story?id=4580057 |title=Shock makes move official |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> On November 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] had folded due to lack of support from its current owners, the [[Maloof family]], who were also the owners of the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The league announced it would seek new owners to relocate the team to the [[San Francisco Bay area]]; however, no ownership was found and a [[dispersal draft]] was held on December 14, 2009.\n\nThe 2010 season saw a tight race in the [[Eastern Conference (WNBA)|East]], with three teams being tied for first place on the final day of the regular season. Five of the six teams in the East were in first place at some point during the season. The East held a .681 winning percentage over the [[Western Conference (WNBA)|West]], its highest ever. In the [[2010 WNBA Finals|2010 Finals]], two new teams represented each conference: the [[Seattle Storm]] and the [[Atlanta Dream]]. Seattle made their first finals appearance since winning it all in [[2004 WNBA Finals|2004]] and Atlanta, coming into the playoffs as a four seed, impressively swept its opponents in the first two rounds to advance to the Finals in only the third year of the team's existence.\n\nAfter the 2010 season, President Orender announced she would be resigning from her position as of December 31. On April 21, 2011, NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that former [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer [[Laurel J. Richie]] would assume duties as President on May 16, 2011.\n\nThe 2011 season began with strong publicity helped by the rising young stars of the league and the NBA lockout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/07/nbacom-gets-new-lockout-makeover-bumps-up-wnba-coverage.html |title=NBA.com gets new lockout makeover |work=[[NESN|NESN.com]] |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 17, 2011 |first=Michael |last=Hurley}}</ref> \nThe [[2011 NBA lockout]] began on July 1, 2011. Unlike the previous lockout, which affected the WNBA, president [[Laurel J. Richie]] confirmed that this lockout would not affect the WNBA. If the NBA season was shortened or canceled, the 2012 WNBA season (including the WNBA teams still owned by NBA owners) would run as planned. The lockout ended on November 26, and NBA teams would play a 66-game regular season following the lockout.\n\nMany news outlets began covering the league more frequently. [[NBA TV]], the television home of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] scheduled over 70 regular-season games to be televised (along with a dozen more on [[WNBA on ESPN|ESPN2]] and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]). The new influx of young talent into the league gave many teams something to be excited about. Players like [[Candace Parker]] of the [[Los Angeles Sparks|Sparks]], [[Maya Moore]] of the [[Minnesota Lynx|Lynx]], [[DeWanna Bonner]] of the [[Phoenix Mercury|Mercury]], [[Angel McCoughtry]] of the [[Atlanta Dream|Dream]], [[Sylvia Fowles]] of the [[Chicago Sky|Sky]], [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]] of the [[Connecticut Sun|Sun]], and [[Liz Cambage]] of the [[Tulsa Shock|Shock]] brought a new level of excitement to the game, adding talent to the teams of young veterans such as [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Seimone Augustus]] and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. The level of play seemed to be evidenced by higher scoring, better defense, and higher shooting percentages. By the end of the [[2011 WNBA season|2011 regular season]], nine of the twelve teams in the league had increased attendance over their [[WNBA#Attendance|2010 averages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/5337/2011wnbaattendancepic.png |title=WNBA Attendance |work=WNBA |author=Abontorab99 |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Connecticut Sun]] center [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]] set a league record for double-doubles in a season with 23. Also, [[Sylvia Fowles]] of the [[Chicago Sky]] became only the second player in WNBA history to finish a season averaging at least 20 points (20.0ppg) and 10 rebounds (10.2rpg) per game. The [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] experienced boosts from their young players as well; rookie [[Danielle Adams]] scored 32 points off the bench in June and fellow rookie [[Danielle Robinson]] had a 36-point game in September. [[Atlanta Dream]] forward [[Angel McCoughtry]] was the first player in league history to average over 20 points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30 minutes per game (27.9mpg).\n\nMcCoughtry led her team to the [[2011 WNBA Finals|Finals]] for the second straight year, but despite breaking her own Finals scoring record, the Dream was swept for the second straight year, this time by the [[Minnesota Lynx]], which won its first title behind a fully healthy [[Seimone Augustus]].\n\n2012 featured a long [[2012 Olympic Games|Olympic]] break. The [[Indiana Fever]] won that year's WNBA championship.\n\n===The Three to See (2013)===\nThe much-publicized [[2013 WNBA Draft]] produced Baylor University star [[Brittney Griner]], Delaware's [[Elena Delle Donne]], and Notre Dame All American [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (now Diggins-Smith) as the top three picks, the draft was the first to be televised in primetime on [[ESPN]]. Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins have thus labeled \"The Three To See\", but with the draft also came standouts such as [[Tayler Hill]], [[Layshia Clarendon]] and [[Alex Bentley]]. The retirement of legends [[Katie Smith]], [[Tina Thompson]], [[Ticha Penicheiro]], and [[Sheryl Swoopes]] coupled with the arrival of highly touted rookies and new rule changes effectively marked the end of an era for the WNBA and the ushering of another. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOn the court, the [[Minnesota Lynx]] won their second title in three years, defeating the [[Atlanta Dream]] in the [[2013 WNBA Finals|Finals]], and becoming the first team to sweep the playoff since the [[Seattle Storm]].\n\nThe promotion of Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins helped boost television ratings for the league by 28 percent, and half of the teams ended the season profitable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/11/11/Media/By-The-Numbers.aspx|title=With rebound, WNBA solidifies spot at ESPN|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2014/02/no-the-wnba-is-not-a-major-sport-and-thats-fine/|title=No, the WNBA is Not a Major Sport (And That\u2019s Fine)|publisher=Sports Media Watch}}</ref> The improved health of the league was on display after the season, when the [[Los Angeles Sparks]]' ownership group folded; it took the league only a few weeks to line up [[Guggenheim Partners]] to purchase the team, and the franchise also garnered interest from the ownership of the [[Golden State Warriors]].\n\n=== New CBA and Commissioner's Cup (2020) ===\nDuring the 2018 season, the WNBA players' union opted out of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, which then ended after the 2019 season. In January 2020, the league and union announced that they had reached an agreement on a new CBA to take effect with the 2020 season and running through 2027. Among the features of the new agreement are:<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-and-wnbpa-reach-tentative-agreement-on-groundbreaking-eight-year-collective-bargaining-agreement/ |title=WNBA And WNBPA Reach Tentative Agreement On Groundbreaking Eight-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement |publisher=WNBA |date=January 14, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/28482619/what-new-cba-means-wnba-players |title=What the new CBA means to the WNBA and its players |first=Mechelle |last=Voepel |website=ESPN.com |date=January 14, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n* Total player compensation will increase by slightly over 50%. While most of this increase will go to star players, all players will benefit to some degree, and both sides were interested mainly in limiting, if not eliminating, overseas play by the league's top players.\n* Players will be able to reach unrestricted free agency a year earlier than before. The previous CBA allowed a team to designate a player as \"core\"\u2014similar to the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[franchise tag]]\u2014four times. This drops to three in 2020 and will drop further to two in 2022.\n* All player air travel to regular-season games will be, at a minimum, premium economy class. Also, each player will have her own hotel room for road games.\n* Players will receive their full salary while on maternity leave. Additionally, an annual childcare stipend of $5,000 per player will be provided; teams will make apartments of at least two bedrooms available to players with children, and add facilities for nursing mothers; and the league will offer family planning benefits that allow up to a $60,000 reimbursement for veteran players for expenses related to adoption, surrogacy, embryo preservation, or infertility treatment.\n* The CBA will transition toward severely penalizing veteran players for late arrival at WNBA training camps. By the sixth year of the CBA, players with more than 2 years of service who miss the start of training camp will be suspended for the season. Exceptions include serious injury, national team commitments for non-US players, college graduations, and other significant life events.\n* The CBA also addressed the issue of players serving on NBA coaching staffs during the traditional basketball season. This came to a head during the 2019 offseason when the [[Washington Wizards]], owned by the same company that owns the WNBA's Mystics, hired Mystics player [[Kristi Toliver]] as an assistant. Under the previous CBA, teams were allowed only $50,000 per year to allocate to players as an enticement to not play overseas. Because of the Mystics' and Wizards' shared ownership, the Wizards could only pay Toliver from the Mystics' $50,000 allocation\u2014most of which had already been committed to [[Elena Delle Donne]], a player who normally does not go overseas. With the new CBA, veteran players can work as coaches in the NBA without a salary limit, regardless of the team's ownership structure.\n\nAlso in January 2020, the WNBA announced a new in-season tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, which will begin with the 2020 season. Each team will play 10 Cup games during the season\u2014specifically, the first home and road games against each team in its conference. The final Cup games will be played in July, with the top team in the Cup standings from each conference advancing to a one-off Cup final in August.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/28497496/wnba-expands-36-game-schedule-adds-commissioner-cup |title=WNBA expands to 36-game schedule, adds Commissioner's Cup |agency=Associated Press |website=ESPN.com |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe 2020 WNBA schedule originally included a month-long break in July and August to allow players to participate in the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics]].  The 2020 games have been postponed till 2021, thanks to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]], rendering the break unnecessary.  On April 3, 2020, the WNBA announced that the beginning of its own schedule would be postponed. The [[2020 WNBA draft|2020 entry draft]] will however proceed as originally scheduled on April 17. <ref>https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-statement-regarding-the-start-of-the-2020-regular-season/</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{{WNBA labeled map|float=right}}\nThe WNBA originated with 8 teams in 1997, and through a sequence of expansions, contractions, and relocations currently consist of 12 teams.

Becoming the Stars in 2014, they shared the Spurs' team colors. The team would eventually relocate to Las Vegas as the [[Las Vegas Aces|Aces]] in 2017. The [[Detroit Shock]] was the sister team of the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] until the teams' owner sold the Shock to investors who [[Tulsa Shock|moved the team]] to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. During its tenure in Tulsa, it was not affiliated with Oklahoma's NBA team, the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].\n\nFive teams share a market with an [[NBA G League]] team.

The Shock shared the Tulsa market with the [[Tulsa 66ers]] until the latter team was relocated to become the [[Oklahoma City Blue]] in 2014.\n\n===Membership timeline===\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20\nPeriod = from:1997 till:2020\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea = right:30 left:0 bottom:50 top:5\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7)\n id:line value:black\n id:bg   value:white\n\nPlotData=\n width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n bar:1  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:09/30/2003 text: [[Cleveland Rockers]] (1997\u20132003)\n bar:2  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:01/03/2007 text: [[Charlotte Sting]] (1997\u20132006)\n bar:3  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:12/05/2008 text: [[Houston Comets]] (1997\u20132008)\n bar:4  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:12/08/2009 text: [[Sacramento Monarchs]] (1997\u20132009)\n bar:5  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[New York Liberty]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:6  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[Los Angeles Sparks]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:7  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[Phoenix Mercury]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:01/01/1997 till:11/05/2002 text: [[Utah Starzz]] (1997\u20132002)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:12/05/2002 till:12/14/2013 text: [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] (2003\u20132013)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:01/14/2014 till:10/16/2017 text: [[San Antonio Stars]] (2013\u20132017)\n bar:8  color:powderblue from:11/17/2017 till:end text: [[Las Vegas Aces]] (2018\u2013present)\n bar:9  color:powderblue from:01/01/1998 till:end text: [[Washington Mystics]] (1998\u2013present)\n bar:10 color:pink       from:01/01/1998 till:10/19/2009 text: [[Detroit Shock]] (1998\u20132009)\n bar:10 color:pink       from:11/19/2009 till:07/20/2015 text: [[Tulsa Shock]] (2010\u20132015)\n bar:10 color:powderblue from:08/20/2015 till:end text: [[Dallas Wings]] (2016\u2013present)\n bar:11 color:powderblue from:01/01/1999 till:end text: [[Minnesota Lynx]] (1999\u2013present)\n bar:12 color:pink       from:01/01/1999 till:12/01/2002 text: [[Orlando Miracle]] (1999\u20132002)\n bar:12 color:powderblue from:01/01/2003 till:end text: [[Connecticut Sun]] (2003\u2013present)\n bar:13 color:orange     from:01/01/2000 till:12/31/2002 text: [[Miami Sol]] (2000\u20132002)\n bar:14 color:orange     from:01/01/2000 till:12/31/2002 text: [[Portland Fire]] (2000\u20132002)\n bar:15 color:powderblue from:01/01/2000 till:end text: [[Indiana Fever]] (2000\u2013present)\n bar:16 color:powderblue from:01/01/2000 till:end text: [[Seattle Storm]] (2000\u2013present)\n bar:17 color:powderblue from:01/01/2006 till:end text: [[Chicago Sky]] (2006\u2013present)\n bar:18 color:powderblue from:01/01/2008 till:end text: [[Atlanta Dream]] (2008\u2013present)\n\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:4 start:1997\n\n</timeline>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; float:right;\"\n|-\n|+ WNBA expansion<br />and contraction \n|-\n!

Training camps allow the coaching staff to prepare the players for the regular season and determine the 12-woman roster with which they will begin the regular season. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.\n\nThe WNBA regular season begins in May. During the regular season, each team plays 36 games, 18 each home and away. Each team plays three in-conference teams 4 times and the remaining in-conference teams thrice each (18 games). Each team then plays the six out-of-conference teams thrice (18 games). As in the NBA, each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season.\n\nDuring years in which the [[Summer Olympics]] are held, the WNBA takes a month off in the middle of the season to allow players to practice and compete with their respective national teams.\n\n===WNBA Commissioner's Cup===\nThe 2020 season will be the first for the Commissioner's Cup, an in-season tournament. Each team's first home and away games against each of its conference opponents, all of which will be played in the first half of the season, are designated as Cup games. After each team has played its 10 Cup games, the top team in each conference's Cup standings will advance to the Commissioner's Cup Final, a single match held in August.\n\n===WNBA All-Star Game===\nIn 1999 the league held its first-ever All-Star Game where the best players of the Eastern Conference played against the best players of the Western Conference. Since the All-Star games were ongoing, the West has been dominant until 2006, when the East finally won a game.\n\nIn July, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual [[WNBA All-Star Game]]. The game is part of a weekend-long event, held in a selected WNBA city each year. The actual game is played on the selected WNBA team's home court. The All-Star Game features star players from the Western Conference facing star players from the Eastern Conference. During the season, fans vote for the players they would like to see start the game. In 2004, [[The Game at Radio City]] was held in a place of a traditional All-Star Game. The 2006 All-Star Game was the first game to feature custom uniforms that match the decade anniversary logo. Since 2008, no All-Star Game has been held in any Summer Olympic year. In 2010, an exhibition game ([[Stars at the Sun]]) was held.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the [[trading deadline]]. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline.\n\n===WNBA Playoffs===\n{{Main|WNBA Playoffs}}\nThe WNBA Playoffs usually begin in late September, though in years of the [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup|FIBA World Cup]] they begin in August. In the current system, the eight best teams by the regular-season record, without regard to conference alignment, qualify for the playoffs. Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first two seeds get double byes, and the next two seeds get first-round byes, having a higher seed generally means one will be facing a weaker team. The team in each series with a better record has a home-court advantage. Since 2016 [[Verizon]] is the official sponsor.\n\nThe first two playoff rounds follow a tournament format with each team playing a rival in a single-elimination game, with the winners advancing to the next round and losers being eliminated from the playoffs. For the first round, the matchups by seed are 5th vs 8th and 6th vs 7th. In the second round, the matchups by seed are 3rd vs the lowest remaining seed and 4th vs the highest remaining seed. In the semifinals, the matchups by seed are 1st vs the lowest remaining seed and 2nd vs the highest remaining seed. This leaves two teams left to play each other in the WNBA Finals. The first and second rounds consist of single-elimination games, while the semifinals are best-of-five series using a 2\u20132\u20131 home-court pattern, meaning that the higher-seeded team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the other team plays at home in game 3 and 4. This pattern has been in place since 2016 (changed from the best-of-three series 1\u20131\u20131 format for four teams in each conference, where the higher seed hosted the opening game in the first two rounds).\n\n===WNBA Finals===\n{{Main|WNBA Finals}}\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-five series between the two semifinal winners, is known as the WNBA Finals and is held annually, currently scheduled for October. Each player on the winning team receives a championship ring. Also, the league awards a [[WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]]. For this round, the series follows a 2\u20132\u20131 pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5, while the other plays at home in games 3 and 4. The 2\u20132\u20131 pattern in the WNBA Finals has been in place since 2005.\n\n{{hidden begin|expanded=y|titlestyle=background:#ffe6bd|border=1px #aaa solid|ta1=center|title=The WNBA Finals}}\n{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|ta1=center|title=1990s}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The main arc is essentially identical to that used by [[FIBA]] (effective October 1, 2012 for domestic competitions) and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA men's]] play (effective in 2019\u201320 in Division I and 2020\u201321 in Divisions II and III). The WNBA corner distance, as measured from the center of the basket, is identical to that of the NBA; the FIBA and NCAA men's distance at the corners is {{convert|4|in|cm|2|abbr=on}} shorter.\n* The regulation WNBA ball is a minimum {{convert|28.5|in|cm}} in circumference and weighs {{convert|20.0|oz|g}}, {{convert|1|in|cm}} smaller and {{convert|2|oz|g}} lighter than the NBA ball. Since 2004, this size has been used for all senior-level women's competitions throughout the world in full-court basketball. Competitions in the half-court [[3x3 basketball|3x3]] variant used the women's ball until 2015, when a dedicated ball with the circumference of the women's ball but the weight of the men's ball was introduced.\n* Quarters are 10 minutes in duration instead of 12.\n\nGames are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original two 20-minute halves of play, similar to FIBA and NCAA women's college rules (many WNBA players play in European, Chinese, or Australian leagues, which all use the FIBA rule set).\n\nA recent trend with new WNBA rules has been to match them with a similar NBA rule. Since the [[2006 WNBA season]]:<ref name=\"WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/news/rulechanges_051206.html |title=WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2006 |date=December 6, 2005 |work=[[WNBA.com]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* The winner of the opening jump ball shall begin the 4th quarter with the ball out of bounds. The loser shall begin with the ball out of bounds in the second and third quarters. Previously under the two-half format, both periods started with jump balls, presumably to eliminate the possibility of a team purposely losing the opening tip to gain the opening possession of the second half. This is not a problem under the four-quarters because the ''winner'' of the opening tip gets the opening possession of the final period.\n* The [[shot clock]] was decreased from 30 to 24 seconds. The rule changes signaled a move away from rules more similar to those of [[college basketball]] and toward those that provide a more NBA-like game. FIBA also uses a 24-second clock. Also, come 2020, last 5 seconds of the shot clock counts down in tenths of a second.\n\nThe [[2007 WNBA season]] brought changes that included:<ref name=\"WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2007 Season\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/news/newrules_release_070130.html |title=WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2007 Season |date=January 30, 2007 |work=[[WNBA.com]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds.\n* A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach.\n* Two free throws and possession of the ball for a clear-path-to-the-basket foul. Previously only one free throw was awarded as well as possession.\n\nIn [[2012 WNBA season|2012]], the WNBA added the block/charge arc under the basket. As of [[2013 WNBA season|2013]] the defensive three-second rule and anti-flopping guidelines were introduced. The three-point line was also extended; in 2017, that line extended into the corners to match the NBA's.\n\nSince [[2017 WNBA season|2017]], [[Tissot]] is the official timekeeper for the league, as it uses a unified game clock/shot clock system.\n\n===Court dimensions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 60%; margin:1em auto;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|WNBA Court Dimensions\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Many players such as Brittney Grinner, Breanna Stewart, and Maya Moore have spoken about equality between gender, sexual orientation, and race.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.swishappeal.com/2018/5/1/17305038/2018-wnba-hoops-happenings-womens-basketball-nike-uniforms-breanna-stewart-wild-feminist-sue-bird\n|title=Hoops Happening: Today in women\u2019s basketball|date=May 1, 2018|publisher= Tamryn Spruill| accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref> The players have also supported progressive social and political movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]] and others.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shoichet |first1=Catherine E. |last2=Martin |first2=Jill |title=Off-duty cops walkout over WNBA players' Black Lives Matter shirts |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/12/us/wnba-minnesota-lynx-black-lives-matter-shirts/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=29 December 2018 |date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorships===\nOn June 1, 2009, the [[Phoenix Mercury]] was the first team in WNBA history to announce a marquee sponsorship.

The deal also includes the sponsorship of the All-Star Game, Inspiring Women Luncheon, and other unspecified events, but not the Monthly and Yearly Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2016/03/14/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/WNBA-Verizon.aspx|title=Verizon stakes out space on WNBA jerseys|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn March 28, the league introduced new uniforms bearing the new Verizon sponsor name, which eliminated white jerseys and made the secondary color a basis for a uniform. The jersey font remained unchanged, as well as the primary color used for the away uniform. Teams can use either jersey for home and away games. Pictures of the jerseys can be viewed on the WNBA website.\n\nIn 2009, the Phoenix Mercury became the first American professional basketball team to feature advertisements on their uniform, when they sold an ad to LifeLock Insurance on the front of their jerseys, leading many people to wonder if ads on NBA uniforms were coming soon. Since then several other WNBA teams have followed suit. The NBA announced in the summer of 2016 that they will begin to feature advertisements on jerseys, with the first team to do so being the Philadelphia 76ers (with a StubHub sticker now on their jerseys).\nBefore the start of the 2011 season, every team announced a new look for their uniforms. The supplier of the uniforms for the league, [[Adidas]], upgraded all teams to new high-tech designs, much like they did for the NBA before the start of their season.\n\nOn April 8, 2019, the WNBA announced a multiyear marquee partnership with [[AT&T]], making them the first non-apparel partner to have its logo featured on the front of all 12 team jerseys. The jerseys officially debuted during the [[2019 WNBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AT&T and WNBA Announce Landmark Marquee Partnership |url=https://www.wnba.com/news/att-and-wnba-announce-landmark-marquee-partnership/ |website=WNBA.com |accessdate=May 23, 2019 |date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSponsorships have come from major companies such as Boost Mobile and Farmers Insurance. Pepsi and Nike have also partnered up with the WNBA.\n\nAs of the [[2019 WNBA season]], the [[Atlanta Dream]] are the only team with no team sponsors.\n\n===Salaries, rosters, and collective bargaining===\nBefore the 2009 season, the maximum team roster size was changed from 13 players (11 active and 2 inactive) to 11 players (all active). Any team that falls below nine players able to play due to injury or any other factor outside of the control of the team will, upon request, be granted a roster hardship exception allowing the team to sign an additional player or players so that the team will have nine players able to play in an upcoming game or games. As soon as the injured (or otherwise sidelined) player(s) can play, the roster hardship player(s)\u2014not any other player on the roster\u2014must be waived.\nIn March 2014, the WNBA and players signed a new, 8-year collective bargaining agreement, increasing the number of players on a roster to 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/10565327/wnba-players-union-agree-8-year-collective-bargaining-agreement|title=WNBA, players' union agree to 8-year CBA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[WNBA Draft]] is held annually every spring. The minimum age is 22 years for American players and 20 years for international players, measured as of December 31 of the calendar year of the draft. The draft is three rounds long, with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) getting three picks each. The draft order for the eight teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records, and the team with the highest previous record will pick last. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.\n\nPreviously, in 2008, a new six-year collective bargaining agreement was agreed upon between the players and the league. The [[salary cap]] for an entire team in 2010 was $827,000 (although it was later lowered to $775,000). By 2013 (the sixth year under this agreement), the cap for an entire team was $900,000. In 2010, the ''minimum'' salary for a player with three-plus years of experience was $51,000 while the ''maximum'' salary for a six-plus year player was $101,500 (the first time in league history that players can receive over $100,000). The minimum salary for rookies was $35,190.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/rosters/salary.html|title=Women's basketball salary|access-date=2013-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801060900/http://womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/rosters/salary.html|archive-date=2013-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/wnbacba08.pdf|title=Women's basketball 2008|access-date=2013-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801064634/http://www.womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/wnbacba08.pdf|archive-date=2013-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many WNBA players supplement their salaries by playing in European, [[Women's National Basketball League|Australian]], or more recently [[Women's Chinese Basketball Association|Chinese]] women's basketball leagues during the WNBA off-season. The WNBA has been criticized for [[gender pay gap|paying female players less]] than their NBA counterparts, although this is attributed to the much greater revenues of the NBA.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/basketballs-gender-wage-gap-is-even-worse-than-you-think |title=Basketball's Gender Wage Gap Is Even Worse Than You Think |publisher=VICE Sports |date=12 August 2015 |last1=Berri |first1=David |accessdate=5 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406131910/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/basketballs-gender-wage-gap-is-even-worse-than-you-think |archivedate=6 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe decision of superstar [[Diana Taurasi]] to sit out the 2015 WNBA season was seen by some in the media as a harbinger of salary-related troubles in the future. The Russian club for which she was playing at the time, [[UMMC Ekaterinburg]], offered her a bonus well over the league's salary cap to sit out that season. Taurasi accepted, largely because she had not had an offseason since playing college basketball more than a decade earlier. Such offers have often been made to star American players, including Taurasi herself, but none were accepted until Taurasi did so in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes |title=Diana Taurasi's decision to sit out should spark WNBA salary changes |first=Kate |last=Fagan |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA more recent incident that led to widespread media comment on the WNBA's salary structure was the [[Achilles tendon rupture|torn]] [[Achilles tendon|Achilles]] suffered by reigning WNBA MVP [[Breanna Stewart]] while playing for another Russian side, [[Dynamo Kursk]], in the [[2018\u201319 EuroLeague Women|2019 EuroLeague Women final]].

With overseas leagues offering much higher salaries to many players than the WNBA currently provides, roughly 70% of the league's players go overseas in any given season. While these players do not necessarily play as many games as NBA players do in their seasons, even participants in the NBA Finals get several months of rest in the offseason, something not available for WNBA players who also play overseas.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/storm/breanna-stewarts-achilles-injury-underscores-need-for-wnba-to-find-solution-to-pay-issue/ |title=Breanna Stewart\u2019s Achilles injury underscores need for WNBA to find solution to pay issue |first=Larry |last=Stone |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=April 19, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2019/04/14/breanna-stewart-injury-have-major-impact-wnba-cba-talks/3470025002/ |title=WNBA star Breanna Stewart to miss season after Achilles injury in EuroLeague championship |first=Jeff |last=Metcalf |newspaper=Arizona Republic |date=April 14, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Voepel Stewie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/26532729/could-breanna-stewart-injury-tipping-point-wnba-negotiations |title=Could Breanna Stewart's injury be tipping point in WNBA negotiations? |first=Mechelle |last=Voepel |website=ESPN.com |date=April 17, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> In a story on the ramifications of Stewart's injury, Mechelle Voepel of ESPN had this to say about the lead-in to the injury:<ref name=\"Voepel Stewie\"/><blockquote> For Stewart, her 2018 went like this: playing in [[Women's Chinese Basketball Association|China]], brief time off, [[2018 WNBA season|WNBA season]], [[2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] in the Canary Islands, brief time off, playing in Russia.

However, about half of the decline in attendance from 2017 to 2018 was due to the New York Liberty moving from 19,812-seat [[Madison Square Garden]] to the 5,000-seat [[Westchester County Center]]. While the Liberty had averaged over 9,000 fans in 2017, [[James L.

Before the 2012 season, it was announced that users of LiveAccess would have to pay a $4.99 subscription fee to use the service. In 2013, this was increased to $14.99. In 2014 the streaming service was renamed WNBA League Pass.\n\nWNBA League Pass is available as part of the WNBA App, the free mobile application available on iPhone, iPad and Android devices and costs US$16.99 for the season. Games airing on ESPN, ESPN2 and CBS Sports Network, as well as other games taking place during the telecast windows of ESPN and ESPN2 games, are not available live on WNBA League Pass.

It is currently composed of twelve teams. The league was founded on April 22, 1996, as the women's counterpart to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and league play started in 1997. The regular season is played from May to September, with the All Star game being played midway through the season in July (except in [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] years) and the [[WNBA Finals]] at the end of September until the beginning of October. Starting in 2020, a midseason tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, will be added. Initially, regular-season Cup games were to be played through early July, followed by a final match in August. This schedule is subject to change due to disruptions from the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nFive WNBA teams have direct NBA counterparts and play in the same arena: [[Indiana Fever]], [[Los Angeles Sparks]], [[Minnesota Lynx]], [[New York Liberty]], and [[Phoenix Mercury]]. The [[Atlanta Dream]], [[Chicago Sky]], [[Connecticut Sun]], [[Dallas Wings]], [[Las Vegas Aces]],  [[Seattle Storm]], and [[Washington Mystics]] do not share an arena with a direct NBA counterpart, although four of the seven (the Dream, the Sky, the Wings, and the Mystics) share a market with an NBA counterpart, and the Storm shared an arena and market with an NBA team at the time of its founding. The Dream, the Sky, the Sun, the Wings, the Aces, the Sparks, and the Storm are all independently owned.\n\n==History==\n===League founded and play begins (1996\u201397)===\nThe creation of the WNBA was officially approved by the NBA Board of Governors on April 22, 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/history/|title=History \u2013 WNBA.com |website=WNBA.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> and announced at a press conference with [[Rebecca Lobo]], [[Lisa Leslie]], and [[Sheryl Swoopes]] in attendance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/original-three-lisa-leslie-sheryl-swoopes-rebecca-lobo-wnba-draft/|title=Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Rebecca Lobo Reunited at WNBA Draft|website=WNBA.com \u2013 Official Site of the WNBA|language=English|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> The new WNBA had to compete with the recently formed [[American Basketball League (1996\u201398)|American Basketball League]], another professional women's basketball league that began play in the fall of 1996 but would cease operation during its 1998\u201399 season.\n\nThe WNBA began with eight teams: the [[Charlotte Sting]], [[Cleveland Rockers]], [[Houston Comets]], and [[New York Liberty]] in the Eastern Conference; and the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], [[Phoenix Mercury]], [[Sacramento Monarchs]], and [[Utah Starzz]] in the Western Conference.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/about_us/historyof_wnba.html|title=WNBA.com: History of the WNBA|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile not the first major women's professional basketball league in the United States (a distinction held by the defunct [[Women's Pro Basketball League|WBL]]), the WNBA is the only league to receive full backing of the NBA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/10382007/wnba-nba-commissioner-david-stern-changed-women-basketball|title=Voepel: Stern changed women's basketball|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref> The WNBA logo, \"Logo Woman\", paralleled the NBA logo and was selected out of 50 different designs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the heels of a much-publicized gold medal run by the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] USA Basketball Women's National Team at the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympic Games]], the WNBA began its first season on June 21, 1997 to little fanfare. The first WNBA game featured the [[New York Liberty]] facing the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The game was televised nationally in the United States on the [[NBC]] television network. At the start of the 1997 season, the WNBA had television deals in place with NBC (NBA rights holder), and the [[Walt Disney Company]] and [[Hearst Corporation]] joint venture channels, [[ESPN]] and [[Lifetime Television]] Network, respectively.

We expect to keep growing the league.\"<ref>[http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1999/06/8/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/WNBA-EXPANDS-BY-FOUR-ARE-MORE-CITIES-ON-THE-HORIZON.aspx \"WNBA EXPANDS BY FOUR ... ARE MORE CITIES ON THE HORIZON?\"], Sports Business Daily, June 8, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the league's chief competition, the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|American Basketball League]], folded. Many of the ABL's star players, including several Olympic gold medalists (such as [[Nikki McCray]] and [[Dawn Staley]]) and a number of standout college performers (including [[Kate Starbird]] and [[Jennifer Rizzotti]]), then joined the rosters of WNBA teams and, in so doing, enhanced the overall quality of play in the league. When a lockout resulted in an abbreviated NBA season, the WNBA saw faltering TV viewership.\n\nOn May 23, 2000, the [[Houston Comets]] became the first WNBA team to be invited to the [[White House Rose Garden]]. Before this invitation, only men's sports teams had traveled to the White House.\n\nAt the end of the 2000 season, the [[Houston Comets]] won their fourth championship, capturing every title since the league's inception. Led by the \"Big Three\" of [[Sheryl Swoopes]], [[Tina Thompson]], and four-time [[WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]] [[Cynthia Cooper-Dyke|Cynthia Cooper]], the Comets dominated every team in the league. Under head coach [[Van Chancellor]], the team posted a 98\u201324 record through their first four seasons (16\u20133 in the [[WNBA Playoffs|Playoffs]]). After 2000, Cooper retired from the league, and the Comets' dynasty came to an end.\n\n===The L.A. Sparks; new league ownership and contraction (2001\u20132002)===\n[[File:LisaLeslieDec10.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Lisa Leslie of the Sparks]]\nThe top contender in the 2001 season was the [[Los Angeles Sparks]]. Led by [[Lisa Leslie]], the Sparks posted a regular-season record of 28\u20134. They advanced to their first ever [[WNBA Finals]] and swept the [[Charlotte Sting]].\n\nLooking to repeat in 2002, the Sparks again made a strong run toward the postseason, going 25\u20137 in the regular season under head coach [[Michael Cooper]], formerly of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Again, Leslie dominated opponents throughout the Playoffs, leading the Sparks to a perfect 6\u20130 record through all three rounds, beating the [[New York Liberty]] in the [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002 Finals]].\n\nTeams and the league were collectively owned by the NBA until the end of 2002, when the NBA sold WNBA teams either to their NBA counterparts in the same city or to a third party, as a result of the [[dot-com bubble]]. This led to two teams moving: Utah moved to [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio]], and Orlando moved to [[Connecticut Sun|Connecticut]] and became the first WNBA team to be owned by a third party instead of an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] franchise. This sale of teams also led to two teams folding, the [[Miami Sol]] and [[Portland Fire]], because new owners could not be found.\n\n===Bill Laimbeer leaves his mark (2003\u20132006)===\nThe WNBA Players Association threatened to strike in 2003 if a new deal was not worked out between players and the league. The result was a delay in the start of the 2003 preseason. The [[2003 WNBA Draft]] was also delayed and negative publicity was gained from this strike.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/16/sports/basketball/y16wnba.html |title=W.N.B.A., Going on 7, Has Grown-Up Labor Dispute |date=April 16, 2003 |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking over a struggling franchise in 2002, former [[Detroit Pistons]] forward [[Bill Laimbeer]] had high hopes for the [[Detroit Shock]] in 2003. The team was just 9\u201323 in 2002. The Shock had three all-stars in the [[2003 WNBA All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] ([[Swin Cash]], [[Cheryl Ford]], and [[Deanna Nolan]]). Laimbeer orchestrated a worst-to-first turnaround and the Shock finished the season 25\u20139 in first place in the Eastern Conference. Winning the first two rounds of the Playoffs, the Shock faced two-time champion [[Los Angeles Sparks]] and [[Lisa Leslie]] in the [[2003 WNBA Finals|2003 Finals]]. The Shock beat the Sparks, winning game three on a three-pointer by [[Deanna Nolan]].\n\n[[File:Bill Laimbeer.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.5|Bill Laimbeer]]\nAfter the [[2003 WNBA season|2003 season]], the [[Cleveland Rockers]], one of the league's original eight teams, folded because the owners were unwilling to continue operating the franchise.\n\n[[Val Ackerman]], the first WNBA president, resigned effective February 1, 2005, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. Ackerman later became president of [[USA Basketball]]. On February 15, 2005, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that [[Donna Orender]], who had been serving as the Senior Vice President of the [[PGA Tour]] and who had played for several teams in the now-defunct [[Women's Pro Basketball League]], would be Ackerman's successor as of April 2005.\n\nThe WNBA awarded an [[expansion team]] to [[Chicago]] (later named the [[Chicago Sky|Sky]]) in February 2006. In the off-season, a set of rule changes was approved that made the WNBA more like the NBA.<ref name=2006rules>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/rulechanges_051206.html|title=WNBA official 2006 rule changes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the league became the first team-oriented women's professional sports league to exist for ten consecutive seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/about_us/wnba_history_timeline_2012_04_30.html|title=WNBA.com: WNBA History/Timeline|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> On the occasion of the tenth anniversary, the WNBA released its [[WNBA's All-Decade Team|All-Decade Team]], comprising the ten WNBA players to have contributed, through on-court play and off-court activities, the most to women's basketball during the league's existence.\n\nAfter missing out on the Finals in 2004 and 2005, the Shock bounced back in 2006 behind newly acquired [[Katie Smith]], along with six remaining members from their 2003 Finals run ([[Swin Cash|Cash]], [[Cheryl Ford|Ford]], [[Kedra Holland-Corn|Holland-Corn]], [[Deanna Nolan|Nolan]], [[Elaine Powell|Powell]], and [[Ruth Riley|Riley]]). The Shock finished second in the Eastern Conference and knocked off first-seeded [[Connecticut Sun|Connecticut]] in the second round of the Playoffs. The Shock faced reigning champion [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in a five-game series. The Shock won game five on their home floor.\n\n===Bringing \"Paul Ball\" to the WNBA (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Taurasi 07.25.07.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.55|Diana Taurasi of the Mercury]]\nIn December 2006, the [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]] organization announced it would no longer operate the [[Charlotte Sting]]. Soon after, the WNBA announced that the Sting would not operate for 2007. A [[2007 WNBA Draft#Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] was held on January 8, 2007. Teams selected in inverse order of their 2006 records; [[Chicago Sky|Chicago]] received the first pick.\n\nFormer [[Los Angeles Lakers]] championship coach [[Paul Westhead]] was named head coach of the [[Phoenix Mercury]] on October 11, 2005, bringing his up-tempo style of play to the WNBA. This fast-paced offense was perfect for his team, especially after the league shortened the shot clock from 30 seconds to 24 seconds in 2006. Much like the early [[Houston Comets]] championship teams, the [[Phoenix Mercury]] had risen to prominence led by their own \"Big Three\" of [[Cappie Pondexter]], [[Diana Taurasi]], and [[Penny Taylor]].\n\nThe Mercury was well-suited for the fast offense behind these three players. Phoenix averaged a league-record 88.97 points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the new style of play, and the Mercury were propelled into first place in the Western Conference. Facing the reigning champion [[Detroit Shock]], the Mercury imposed their high-scoring offense with hopes of capturing their first title in franchise history. Averaging 93.2 points per game in the [[2007 WNBA Finals|Finals series]], the Mercury beat Detroit on their home floor in front of 22,076 fans in game five to claim their first-ever WNBA title.\n\nIn October 2007 the WNBA awarded another expansion franchise to [[Atlanta]]. Atlanta businessman Ron Terwilliger was the original owner of the new team. Citizens of Atlanta were able to vote for their choices for the new team's nickname and colors.<ref name=DreamName>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/dream/dream_080123.html|title=DREAM: Atlanta's WNBA Team Named Atlanta Dream|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Atlanta Dream|Dream]], as they were named, played their first regular-season game on May 17, which was a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216145249/http://www.wnba.com/games/20080517/ATLCON/boxscore.html 67\u2013100] loss to the Connecticut Sun.\n\n[[Paul Westhead]] resigned from the Mercury after capturing the 2007 title and [[Penny Taylor]] opted to stay [[Australia|home]] to prepare for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], causing the Mercury to falter in 2008. The team posted a 16\u201318 record and became the first team in WNBA history to miss the Playoffs after winning the championship in the previous season. In their place, the [[Detroit Shock]] won their third championship under coach [[Bill Laimbeer]], solidifying their place in WNBA history before Laimbeer resigned early in 2009, effectively ending the Shock dynasty.\n\nDuring the 2008 regular season, the first-ever outdoor professional basketball game in North America was played at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/sports/basketball/20liberty.html|title=Liberty Has Its Moment in History, if Not a Victory|last=Robbins|first=Liz|date=2008-07-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The First Regular Season Outdoor Game in Professional Basketball History|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/liberty/news/outdoor_classic_2008.html|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the [[New York Liberty]] 71\u201355 in front of over 19,000 fans.\n\nLate in 2008, the WNBA took over ownership of one of the league's original franchises, the [[Houston Comets]]. The Comets ceased operations on December 1, 2008, after no owners for the franchise could be found.<ref name=\"WNBA shutting down league-owned Comets\">[http://sports.espn.go.com/wnba/news/story?id=3738040 Comets To Cease Operations] from ESPN.com</ref> A dispersal draft took place on December 8, 2008, and with the first pick, [[Sancho Lyttle]] was taken by the [[Atlanta Dream]].\n\nAfter an unsatisfying conclusion in 2008, the Mercury looked to bounce back to championship caliber. New head coach [[Corey Gaines]] implemented [[Paul Westhead]]'s style of play, and the Mercury averaged 92.82 points per game throughout the 2009 season. Helped by the return of [[Penny Taylor]], the Mercury once again locked up first place in the Western Conference and advanced to the [[2009 WNBA Finals|2009 Finals]]. The championship series was a battle of contrasting styles as the Mercury (number one league offense, 92.82 points per game) had to face the [[Indiana Fever]] (number three league defense, 73.55 points per game). The series went five games, including arguably one of the most thrilling games in WNBA history in game one of the series (Phoenix won in overtime, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091003043152/http://www.wnba.com/games/20090929/INDPHO/boxscore.html 120\u2013116]. The Mercury beat the Fever in game five, this time on their home court, to capture their second WNBA championship.\n\nNot only did Paul Westhead's system influence his Mercury team, but it created a domino effect throughout the league. Young athletic players were capable of scoring more and playing at a faster pace. As a league, the 2010 average of 80.35 points per game was the best, far surpassing the 69.2 average in the league's [[1997 WNBA season|inaugural season]].\n\n===Changing of the guard (2010\u20132012)===\n[[File:Sylvia Fowles WNBA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Sylvia Fowles of the Sky]]\nOn October 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the [[Detroit Shock]] would relocate to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]; the team is called the [[Tulsa Shock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/wnba/news/story?id=4580057 |title=Shock makes move official |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> On November 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] had folded due to lack of support from its current owners, the [[Maloof family]], who were also the owners of the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The league announced it would seek new owners to relocate the team to the [[San Francisco Bay area]]; however, no ownership was found and a [[dispersal draft]] was held on December 14, 2009.\n\nThe 2010 season saw a tight race in the [[Eastern Conference (WNBA)|East]], with three teams being tied for first place on the final day of the regular season. Five of the six teams in the East were in first place at some point during the season. The East held a .681 winning percentage over the [[Western Conference (WNBA)|West]], its highest ever. In the [[2010 WNBA Finals|2010 Finals]], two new teams represented each conference: the [[Seattle Storm]] and the [[Atlanta Dream]]. Seattle made their first finals appearance since winning it all in [[2004 WNBA Finals|2004]] and Atlanta, coming into the playoffs as a four seed, impressively swept its opponents in the first two rounds to advance to the Finals in only the third year of the team's existence.\n\nAfter the 2010 season, President Orender announced she would be resigning from her position as of December 31. On April 21, 2011, NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that former [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer [[Laurel J. Richie]] would assume duties as President on May 16, 2011.\n\nThe 2011 season began with strong publicity helped by the rising young stars of the league and the NBA lockout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/07/nbacom-gets-new-lockout-makeover-bumps-up-wnba-coverage.html |title=NBA.com gets new lockout makeover |work=[[NESN|NESN.com]] |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 17, 2011 |first=Michael |last=Hurley}}</ref> \nThe [[2011 NBA lockout]] began on July 1, 2011. Unlike the previous lockout, which affected the WNBA, president [[Laurel J. Richie]] confirmed that this lockout would not affect the WNBA. If the NBA season was shortened or canceled, the 2012 WNBA season (including the WNBA teams still owned by NBA owners) would run as planned. The lockout ended on November 26, and NBA teams would play a 66-game regular season following the lockout.\n\nMany news outlets began covering the league more frequently. [[NBA TV]], the television home of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] scheduled over 70 regular-season games to be televised (along with a dozen more on [[WNBA on ESPN|ESPN2]] and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]). The new influx of young talent into the league gave many teams something to be excited about. Players like [[Candace Parker]] of the [[Los Angeles Sparks|Sparks]], [[Maya Moore]] of the [[Minnesota Lynx|Lynx]], [[DeWanna Bonner]] of the [[Phoenix Mercury|Mercury]], [[Angel McCoughtry]] of the [[Atlanta Dream|Dream]], [[Sylvia Fowles]] of the [[Chicago Sky|Sky]], [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]] of the [[Connecticut Sun|Sun]], and [[Liz Cambage]] of the [[Tulsa Shock|Shock]] brought a new level of excitement to the game, adding talent to the teams of young veterans such as [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Seimone Augustus]] and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. The level of play seemed to be evidenced by higher scoring, better defense, and higher shooting percentages. By the end of the [[2011 WNBA season|2011 regular season]], nine of the twelve teams in the league had increased attendance over their [[WNBA#Attendance|2010 averages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/5337/2011wnbaattendancepic.png |title=WNBA Attendance |work=WNBA |author=Abontorab99 |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Connecticut Sun]] center [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]] set a league record for double-doubles in a season with 23. Also, [[Sylvia Fowles]] of the [[Chicago Sky]] became only the second player in WNBA history to finish a season averaging at least 20 points (20.0ppg) and 10 rebounds (10.2rpg) per game. The [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] experienced boosts from their young players as well; rookie [[Danielle Adams]] scored 32 points off the bench in June and fellow rookie [[Danielle Robinson]] had a 36-point game in September. [[Atlanta Dream]] forward [[Angel McCoughtry]] was the first player in league history to average over 20 points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30 minutes per game (27.9mpg).\n\nMcCoughtry led her team to the [[2011 WNBA Finals|Finals]] for the second straight year, but despite breaking her own Finals scoring record, the Dream was swept for the second straight year, this time by the [[Minnesota Lynx]], which won its first title behind a fully healthy [[Seimone Augustus]].\n\n2012 featured a long [[2012 Olympic Games|Olympic]] break. The [[Indiana Fever]] won that year's WNBA championship.\n\n===The Three to See (2013)===\nThe much-publicized [[2013 WNBA Draft]] produced Baylor University star [[Brittney Griner]], Delaware's [[Elena Delle Donne]], and Notre Dame All American [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (now Diggins-Smith) as the top three picks, the draft was the first to be televised in primetime on [[ESPN]]. Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins have thus labeled \"The Three To See\", but with the draft also came standouts such as [[Tayler Hill]], [[Layshia Clarendon]] and [[Alex Bentley]]. The retirement of legends [[Katie Smith]], [[Tina Thompson]], [[Ticha Penicheiro]], and [[Sheryl Swoopes]] coupled with the arrival of highly touted rookies and new rule changes effectively marked the end of an era for the WNBA and the ushering of another. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOn the court, the [[Minnesota Lynx]] won their second title in three years, defeating the [[Atlanta Dream]] in the [[2013 WNBA Finals|Finals]], and becoming the first team to sweep the playoff since the [[Seattle Storm]].\n\nThe promotion of Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins helped boost television ratings for the league by 28 percent, and half of the teams ended the season profitable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/11/11/Media/By-The-Numbers.aspx|title=With rebound, WNBA solidifies spot at ESPN|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2014/02/no-the-wnba-is-not-a-major-sport-and-thats-fine/|title=No, the WNBA is Not a Major Sport (And That\u2019s Fine)|publisher=Sports Media Watch}}</ref> The improved health of the league was on display after the season, when the [[Los Angeles Sparks]]' ownership group folded; it took the league only a few weeks to line up [[Guggenheim Partners]] to purchase the team, and the franchise also garnered interest from the ownership of the [[Golden State Warriors]].\n\n=== New CBA and Commissioner's Cup (2020) ===\nDuring the 2018 season, the WNBA players' union opted out of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, which then ended after the 2019 season. In January 2020, the league and union announced that they had reached an agreement on a new CBA to take effect with the 2020 season and running through 2027. Among the features of the new agreement are:<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-and-wnbpa-reach-tentative-agreement-on-groundbreaking-eight-year-collective-bargaining-agreement/ |title=WNBA And WNBPA Reach Tentative Agreement On Groundbreaking Eight-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement |publisher=WNBA |date=January 14, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/28482619/what-new-cba-means-wnba-players |title=What the new CBA means to the WNBA and its players |first=Mechelle |last=Voepel |website=ESPN.com |date=January 14, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n* Total player compensation will increase by slightly over 50%. While most of this increase will go to star players, all players will benefit to some degree, and both sides were interested mainly in limiting, if not eliminating, overseas play by the league's top players.\n* Players will be able to reach unrestricted free agency a year earlier than before. The previous CBA allowed a team to designate a player as \"core\"\u2014similar to the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[franchise tag]]\u2014four times. This drops to three in 2020 and will drop further to two in 2022.\n* All player air travel to regular-season games will be, at a minimum, premium economy class. Also, each player will have her own hotel room for road games.\n* Players will receive their full salary while on maternity leave. Additionally, an annual childcare stipend of $5,000 per player will be provided; teams will make apartments of at least two bedrooms available to players with children, and add facilities for nursing mothers; and the league will offer family planning benefits that allow up to a $60,000 reimbursement for veteran players for expenses related to adoption, surrogacy, embryo preservation, or infertility treatment.\n* The CBA will transition toward severely penalizing veteran players for late arrival at WNBA training camps. By the sixth year of the CBA, players with more than 2 years of service who miss the start of training camp will be suspended for the season. Exceptions include serious injury, national team commitments for non-US players, college graduations, and other significant life events.\n* The CBA also addressed the issue of players serving on NBA coaching staffs during the traditional basketball season. This came to a head during the 2019 offseason when the [[Washington Wizards]], owned by the same company that owns the WNBA's Mystics, hired Mystics player [[Kristi Toliver]] as an assistant. Under the previous CBA, teams were allowed only $50,000 per year to allocate to players as an enticement to not play overseas. Because of the Mystics' and Wizards' shared ownership, the Wizards could only pay Toliver from the Mystics' $50,000 allocation\u2014most of which had already been committed to [[Elena Delle Donne]], a player who normally does not go overseas. With the new CBA, veteran players can work as coaches in the NBA without a salary limit, regardless of the team's ownership structure.\n\nAlso in January 2020, the WNBA announced a new in-season tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, which will begin with the 2020 season. Each team will play 10 Cup games during the season\u2014specifically, the first home and road games against each team in its conference. The final Cup games will be played in July, with the top team in the Cup standings from each conference advancing to a one-off Cup final in August.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/28497496/wnba-expands-36-game-schedule-adds-commissioner-cup |title=WNBA expands to 36-game schedule, adds Commissioner's Cup |agency=Associated Press |website=ESPN.com |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe 2020 WNBA schedule originally included a month-long break in July and August to allow players to participate in the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics]].

While the [[Atlanta Dream]] shared a home venue with the [[Atlanta Hawks|Hawks]] from 2008 to 2016 and again in 2019, the Hawks never held any ownership stake in the WNBA team.\n\nThe remaining WNBA team, the [[Seattle Storm]], was formerly the sister team of the [[Seattle SuperSonics|SuperSonics]], but was sold to a Seattle-based group before the SuperSonics [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|relocated]] and became the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].\n\nThe now-defunct [[Charlotte Sting]], [[Miami Sol]], [[Portland Fire]], [[Cleveland Rockers]], [[Orlando Miracle]], [[Houston Comets]] and [[Sacramento Monarchs]] were also sister teams of the [[Charlotte Hornets|Hornets]], [[Miami Heat|Heat]], [[Portland Trail Blazers|Trail Blazers]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cavaliers]], [[Orlando Magic|Magic]], [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] and [[Sacramento Kings|Kings]], respectively. The [[Utah Starzz]] were affiliated with the [[Utah Jazz|Jazz]] before relocating to San Antonio as the Silver Stars under the ownership of the [[Spurs Sports & Entertainment|parent company]] of the [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] in 2003. Becoming the Stars in 2014, they shared the Spurs' team colors. The team would eventually relocate to Las Vegas as the [[Las Vegas Aces|Aces]] in 2017. The [[Detroit Shock]] was the sister team of the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] until the teams' owner sold the Shock to investors who [[Tulsa Shock|moved the team]] to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. During its tenure in Tulsa, it was not affiliated with Oklahoma's NBA team, the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].\n\nFive teams share a market with an [[NBA G League]] team. Two of these also share arenas: the Dream share College Park and the [[Gateway Center Arena]] with the [[College Park Skyhawks]] while the Mystics share [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena]] with the [[Capital City Go-Go]]. Also, the Sparks share the Los Angeles market with the [[Agua Caliente Clippers]] and [[South Bay Lakers]], the Wings share the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market with the [[Texas Legends]], and the Liberty shares the [[New York City]] market with the [[Long Island Nets]] and [[Westchester Knicks]]. Three other teams are located within 150 miles of WNBA teams (the [[Delaware Blue Coats]], [[Fort Wayne Mad Ants]], and [[Northern Arizona Suns]] being near the Mystics, Fever, and Mercury, respectively). The Stars were also within 150 miles of a G League team (the [[Austin Spurs]]) before their move to Las Vegas. The Shock shared the Tulsa market with the [[Tulsa 66ers]] until the latter team was relocated to become the [[Oklahoma City Blue]] in 2014.\n\n===Membership timeline===\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20\nPeriod = from:1997 till:2020\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea = right:30 left:0 bottom:50 top:5\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7)\n id:line value:black\n id:bg   value:white\n\nPlotData=\n width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n bar:1  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:09/30/2003 text: [[Cleveland Rockers]] (1997\u20132003)\n bar:2  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:01/03/2007 text: [[Charlotte Sting]] (1997\u20132006)\n bar:3  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:12/05/2008 text: [[Houston Comets]] (1997\u20132008)\n bar:4  color:orange     from:01/01/1997 till:12/08/2009 text: [[Sacramento Monarchs]] (1997\u20132009)\n bar:5  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[New York Liberty]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:6  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[Los Angeles Sparks]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:7  color:powderblue from:01/01/1997 till:end text: [[Phoenix Mercury]] (1997\u2013present)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:01/01/1997 till:11/05/2002 text: [[Utah Starzz]] (1997\u20132002)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:12/05/2002 till:12/14/2013 text: [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] (2003\u20132013)\n bar:8  color:pink       from:01/14/2014 till:10/16/2017 text: [[San Antonio Stars]] (2013\u20132017)\n bar:8  color:powderblue from:11/17/2017 till:end text: [[Las Vegas Aces]] (2018\u2013present)\n bar:9  color:powderblue from:01/01/1998 till:end text: [[Washington Mystics]] (1998\u2013present)\n bar:10 color:pink       from:01/01/1998 till:10/19/2009 text: [[Detroit Shock]] (1998\u20132009)\n bar:10 color:pink       from:11/19/2009 till:07/20/2015 text: [[Tulsa Shock]] (2010\u20132015)\n bar:10 color:powderblue from:08/20/2015 till:end text: [[Dallas Wings]] (2016\u2013present)\n bar:11 color:powderblue from:01/01/1999 till:end text: [[Minnesota Lynx]] (1999\u2013present)\n bar:12 color:pink       from:01/01/1999 till:12/01/2002 text: [[Orlando Miracle]] (1999\u20132002)\n bar:12 color:powderblue from:01/01/2003 till:end text: [[Connecticut Sun]] (2003\u2013present)\n bar:13 color:orange     from:01/01/2000 till:12/31/2002 text: [[Miami Sol]] (2000\u20132002)\n bar:14 color:orange     from:01/01/2000 till:12/31/2002 text: [[Portland Fire]] (2000\u20132002)\n bar:15 color:powderblue from:01/01/2000 till:end text: [[Indiana Fever]] (2000\u2013present)\n bar:16 color:powderblue from:01/01/2000 till:end text: [[Seattle Storm]] (2000\u2013present)\n bar:17 color:powderblue from:01/01/2006 till:end text: [[Chicago Sky]] (2006\u2013present)\n bar:18 color:powderblue from:01/01/2008 till:end text: [[Atlanta Dream]] (2008\u2013present)\n\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:4 start:1997\n\n</timeline>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; float:right;\"\n|-\n|+ WNBA expansion<br />and contraction \n|-\n!

Training camps allow the coaching staff to prepare the players for the regular season and determine the 12-woman roster with which they will begin the regular season. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.\n\nThe WNBA regular season begins in May. During the regular season, each team plays 36 games, 18 each home and away. Each team plays three in-conference teams 4 times and the remaining in-conference teams thrice each (18 games). Each team then plays the six out-of-conference teams thrice (18 games). As in the NBA, each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season.\n\nDuring years in which the [[Summer Olympics]] are held, the WNBA takes a month off in the middle of the season to allow players to practice and compete with their respective national teams.\n\n===WNBA Commissioner's Cup===\nThe 2020 season will be the first for the Commissioner's Cup, an in-season tournament. Each team's first home and away games against each of its conference opponents, all of which will be played in the first half of the season, are designated as Cup games. After each team has played its 10 Cup games, the top team in each conference's Cup standings will advance to the Commissioner's Cup Final, a single match held in August.\n\n===WNBA All-Star Game===\nIn 1999 the league held its first-ever All-Star Game where the best players of the Eastern Conference played against the best players of the Western Conference. Since the All-Star games were ongoing, the West has been dominant until 2006, when the East finally won a game.\n\nIn July, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual [[WNBA All-Star Game]]. The game is part of a weekend-long event, held in a selected WNBA city each year. The actual game is played on the selected WNBA team's home court. The All-Star Game features star players from the Western Conference facing star players from the Eastern Conference. During the season, fans vote for the players they would like to see start the game. In 2004, [[The Game at Radio City]] was held in a place of a traditional All-Star Game. The 2006 All-Star Game was the first game to feature custom uniforms that match the decade anniversary logo. Since 2008, no All-Star Game has been held in any Summer Olympic year. In 2010, an exhibition game ([[Stars at the Sun]]) was held.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the [[trading deadline]]. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline.\n\n===WNBA Playoffs===\n{{Main|WNBA Playoffs}}\nThe WNBA Playoffs usually begin in late September, though in years of the [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup|FIBA World Cup]] they begin in August. In the current system, the eight best teams by the regular-season record, without regard to conference alignment, qualify for the playoffs. Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first two seeds get double byes, and the next two seeds get first-round byes, having a higher seed generally means one will be facing a weaker team. The team in each series with a better record has a home-court advantage. Since 2016 [[Verizon]] is the official sponsor.\n\nThe first two playoff rounds follow a tournament format with each team playing a rival in a single-elimination game, with the winners advancing to the next round and losers being eliminated from the playoffs. For the first round, the matchups by seed are 5th vs 8th and 6th vs 7th. In the second round, the matchups by seed are 3rd vs the lowest remaining seed and 4th vs the highest remaining seed. In the semifinals, the matchups by seed are 1st vs the lowest remaining seed and 2nd vs the highest remaining seed. This leaves two teams left to play each other in the WNBA Finals. The first and second rounds consist of single-elimination games, while the semifinals are best-of-five series using a 2\u20132\u20131 home-court pattern, meaning that the higher-seeded team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the other team plays at home in game 3 and 4. This pattern has been in place since 2016 (changed from the best-of-three series 1\u20131\u20131 format for four teams in each conference, where the higher seed hosted the opening game in the first two rounds).\n\n===WNBA Finals===\n{{Main|WNBA Finals}}\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-five series between the two semifinal winners, is known as the WNBA Finals and is held annually, currently scheduled for October. Each player on the winning team receives a championship ring. Also, the league awards a [[WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]]. For this round, the series follows a 2\u20132\u20131 pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5, while the other plays at home in games 3 and 4. The 2\u20132\u20131 pattern in the WNBA Finals has been in place since 2005.\n\n{{hidden begin|expanded=y|titlestyle=background:#ffe6bd|border=1px #aaa solid|ta1=center|title=The WNBA Finals}}\n{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|ta1=center|title=1990s}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The main arc is essentially identical to that used by [[FIBA]] (effective October 1, 2012 for domestic competitions) and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA men's]] play (effective in 2019\u201320 in Division I and 2020\u201321 in Divisions II and III). The WNBA corner distance, as measured from the center of the basket, is identical to that of the NBA; the FIBA and NCAA men's distance at the corners is {{convert|4|in|cm|2|abbr=on}} shorter.\n* The regulation WNBA ball is a minimum {{convert|28.5|in|cm}} in circumference and weighs {{convert|20.0|oz|g}}, {{convert|1|in|cm}} smaller and {{convert|2|oz|g}} lighter than the NBA ball. Since 2004, this size has been used for all senior-level women's competitions throughout the world in full-court basketball. Competitions in the half-court [[3x3 basketball|3x3]] variant used the women's ball until 2015, when a dedicated ball with the circumference of the women's ball but the weight of the men's ball was introduced.\n* Quarters are 10 minutes in duration instead of 12.\n\nGames are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original two 20-minute halves of play, similar to FIBA and NCAA women's college rules (many WNBA players play in European, Chinese, or Australian leagues, which all use the FIBA rule set).\n\nA recent trend with new WNBA rules has been to match them with a similar NBA rule. Since the [[2006 WNBA season]]:<ref name=\"WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/news/rulechanges_051206.html |title=WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2006 |date=December 6, 2005 |work=[[WNBA.com]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* The winner of the opening jump ball shall begin the 4th quarter with the ball out of bounds. The loser shall begin with the ball out of bounds in the second and third quarters. Previously under the two-half format, both periods started with jump balls, presumably to eliminate the possibility of a team purposely losing the opening tip to gain the opening possession of the second half. This is not a problem under the four-quarters because the ''winner'' of the opening tip gets the opening possession of the final period.\n* The [[shot clock]] was decreased from 30 to 24 seconds. The rule changes signaled a move away from rules more similar to those of [[college basketball]] and toward those that provide a more NBA-like game. FIBA also uses a 24-second clock. Also, come 2020, last 5 seconds of the shot clock counts down in tenths of a second.\n\nThe [[2007 WNBA season]] brought changes that included:<ref name=\"WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2007 Season\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/news/newrules_release_070130.html |title=WNBA Announces Rule Changes for 2007 Season |date=January 30, 2007 |work=[[WNBA.com]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds.\n* A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach.\n* Two free throws and possession of the ball for a clear-path-to-the-basket foul. Previously only one free throw was awarded as well as possession.\n\nIn [[2012 WNBA season|2012]], the WNBA added the block/charge arc under the basket. As of [[2013 WNBA season|2013]] the defensive three-second rule and anti-flopping guidelines were introduced. The three-point line was also extended; in 2017, that line extended into the corners to match the NBA's.\n\nSince [[2017 WNBA season|2017]], [[Tissot]] is the official timekeeper for the league, as it uses a unified game clock/shot clock system.\n\n===Court dimensions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 60%; margin:1em auto;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|WNBA Court Dimensions\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The deal also includes the sponsorship of the All-Star Game, Inspiring Women Luncheon, and other unspecified events, but not the Monthly and Yearly Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2016/03/14/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/WNBA-Verizon.aspx|title=Verizon stakes out space on WNBA jerseys|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn March 28, the league introduced new uniforms bearing the new Verizon sponsor name, which eliminated white jerseys and made the secondary color a basis for a uniform. The jersey font remained unchanged, as well as the primary color used for the away uniform. Teams can use either jersey for home and away games. Pictures of the jerseys can be viewed on the WNBA website.\n\nIn 2009, the Phoenix Mercury became the first American professional basketball team to feature advertisements on their uniform, when they sold an ad to LifeLock Insurance on the front of their jerseys, leading many people to wonder if ads on NBA uniforms were coming soon. Since then several other WNBA teams have followed suit. The NBA announced in the summer of 2016 that they will begin to feature advertisements on jerseys, with the first team to do so being the Philadelphia 76ers (with a StubHub sticker now on their jerseys).\nBefore the start of the 2011 season, every team announced a new look for their uniforms. The supplier of the uniforms for the league, [[Adidas]], upgraded all teams to new high-tech designs, much like they did for the NBA before the start of their season.\n\nOn April 8, 2019, the WNBA announced a multiyear marquee partnership with [[AT&T]], making them the first non-apparel partner to have its logo featured on the front of all 12 team jerseys. The jerseys officially debuted during the [[2019 WNBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AT&T and WNBA Announce Landmark Marquee Partnership |url=https://www.wnba.com/news/att-and-wnba-announce-landmark-marquee-partnership/ |website=WNBA.com |accessdate=May 23, 2019 |date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSponsorships have come from major companies such as Boost Mobile and Farmers Insurance. Pepsi and Nike have also partnered up with the WNBA.\n\nAs of the [[2019 WNBA season]], the [[Atlanta Dream]] are the only team with no team sponsors.\n\n===Salaries, rosters, and collective bargaining===\nBefore the 2009 season, the maximum team roster size was changed from 13 players (11 active and 2 inactive) to 11 players (all active). Any team that falls below nine players able to play due to injury or any other factor outside of the control of the team will, upon request, be granted a roster hardship exception allowing the team to sign an additional player or players so that the team will have nine players able to play in an upcoming game or games. As soon as the injured (or otherwise sidelined) player(s) can play, the roster hardship player(s)\u2014not any other player on the roster\u2014must be waived.\nIn March 2014, the WNBA and players signed a new, 8-year collective bargaining agreement, increasing the number of players on a roster to 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/10565327/wnba-players-union-agree-8-year-collective-bargaining-agreement|title=WNBA, players' union agree to 8-year CBA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[WNBA Draft]] is held annually every spring. The minimum age is 22 years for American players and 20 years for international players, measured as of December 31 of the calendar year of the draft. The draft is three rounds long, with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) getting three picks each. The draft order for the eight teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records, and the team with the highest previous record will pick last. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the [[NBA Draft Lottery]] is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.\n\nPreviously, in 2008, a new six-year collective bargaining agreement was agreed upon between the players and the league. The [[salary cap]] for an entire team in 2010 was $827,000 (although it was later lowered to $775,000). By 2013 (the sixth year under this agreement), the cap for an entire team was $900,000. In 2010, the ''minimum'' salary for a player with three-plus years of experience was $51,000 while the ''maximum'' salary for a six-plus year player was $101,500 (the first time in league history that players can receive over $100,000).

The WNBA has been criticized for [[gender pay gap|paying female players less]] than their NBA counterparts, although this is attributed to the much greater revenues of the NBA.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/basketballs-gender-wage-gap-is-even-worse-than-you-think |title=Basketball's Gender Wage Gap Is Even Worse Than You Think |publisher=VICE Sports |date=12 August 2015 |last1=Berri |first1=David |accessdate=5 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406131910/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/basketballs-gender-wage-gap-is-even-worse-than-you-think |archivedate=6 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe decision of superstar [[Diana Taurasi]] to sit out the 2015 WNBA season was seen by some in the media as a harbinger of salary-related troubles in the future. The Russian club for which she was playing at the time, [[UMMC Ekaterinburg]], offered her a bonus well over the league's salary cap to sit out that season. Taurasi accepted, largely because she had not had an offseason since playing college basketball more than a decade earlier. Such offers have often been made to star American players, including Taurasi herself, but none were accepted until Taurasi did so in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes |title=Diana Taurasi's decision to sit out should spark WNBA salary changes |first=Kate |last=Fagan |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA more recent incident that led to widespread media comment on the WNBA's salary structure was the [[Achilles tendon rupture|torn]] [[Achilles tendon|Achilles]] suffered by reigning WNBA MVP [[Breanna Stewart]] while playing for another Russian side, [[Dynamo Kursk]], in the [[2018\u201319 EuroLeague Women|2019 EuroLeague Women final]].

With overseas leagues offering much higher salaries to many players than the WNBA currently provides, roughly 70% of the league's players go overseas in any given season. While these players do not necessarily play as many games as NBA players do in their seasons, even participants in the NBA Finals get several months of rest in the offseason, something not available for WNBA players who also play overseas.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/storm/breanna-stewarts-achilles-injury-underscores-need-for-wnba-to-find-solution-to-pay-issue/ |title=Breanna Stewart\u2019s Achilles injury underscores need for WNBA to find solution to pay issue |first=Larry |last=Stone |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=April 19, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2019/04/14/breanna-stewart-injury-have-major-impact-wnba-cba-talks/3470025002/ |title=WNBA star Breanna Stewart to miss season after Achilles injury in EuroLeague championship |first=Jeff |last=Metcalf |newspaper=Arizona Republic |date=April 14, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Voepel Stewie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/26532729/could-breanna-stewart-injury-tipping-point-wnba-negotiations |title=Could Breanna Stewart's injury be tipping point in WNBA negotiations? |first=Mechelle |last=Voepel |website=ESPN.com |date=April 17, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> In a story on the ramifications of Stewart's injury, Mechelle Voepel of ESPN had this to say about the lead-in to the injury:<ref name=\"Voepel Stewie\"/><blockquote> For Stewart, her 2018 went like this: playing in [[Women's Chinese Basketball Association|China]], brief time off, [[2018 WNBA season|WNBA season]], [[2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] in the Canary Islands, brief time off, playing in Russia.

Most games (except broadcasts on [[WNBA on ESPN|ABC, ESPN or ESPN2]], which are available on [[ESPN3]]) are available via this system.

Before the 2012 season, it was announced that users of LiveAccess would have to pay a $4.99 subscription fee to use the service. In 2013, this was increased to $14.99. In 2014 the streaming service was renamed WNBA League Pass.\n\nWNBA League Pass is available as part of the WNBA App, the free mobile application available on iPhone, iPad and Android devices and costs US$16.99 for the season. Games airing on ESPN, ESPN2 and CBS Sports Network, as well as other games taking place during the telecast windows of ESPN and ESPN2 games, are not available live on WNBA League Pass.

The township is a municipality as established by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Act 1972, which created a regional government structure and established limits of the local municipalities effective January 1, 1973.  Woolwich Township has its own municipal government consisting of five Councillors and a Mayor; the latter also serves on the Waterloo Region Council.<ref name=\"MayorCouncil\">{{cite web |title=Mayor and Council |url=https://www.woolwich.ca/en/township-services/Mayor-and-Council.aspx |publisher=Woolwich Township |accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land which now makes up Woolwich Township, with the Grand River on the East, and the Conestogo River on the West, originally belonged to the Huron Nation followed by the Mohawk Nation. The first settlers arrived in the late 18th century. In 1798, William Wallace was one of the first settlers after he was deeded 86,078 acres (348 km2) of land on the Grand River for a cost of $16,364. Originally Block three of Indian Lands, this area now comprises a large part of Woolwich Township. The parcel of land called \"Woolwich\" was probably named (in 1816) after a town in Kent, England. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland until about 1830; they settled to the east of the Grand River. Afterwards, German Mennonite families from Pennsylvania and from Waterloo Township settled west of the river.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woolwich Township |url=https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/woolwich-township.aspx |publisher=Ken Seiling Waterloo Region Museum |accessdate=May 22, 2019}} (section \"History of Woolwich Township\")</ref>\n\nIn 1807, Wallace sold the major portion of his tract to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, trustees for the German Company, many of whom would settle this area.<ref>{{cite book | title = County of Waterloo Gazetteer and General Business Directory, For 1864 | publisher = Mitchell & Co. | year = 1864 | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf | pages = 61}}</ref> Wallace sold {{convert|45185|acre|km2|0}} of land to the German Company at $1.00 an acre. Captain Smith, a loyalist from Vermont, settled at the confluence of the Grand and Conestogo Rivers in 1807. Their large log home served as an inn for travelers and he operated a stagecoach for carrying mail from 1835 to 1850. The first church in Woolwich, was built by the Mennonites from Pennsylvania in approximately 1823 at the Three Bridges, now part of Conestogo.<ref name=\"WHSp16\">{{cite book |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933_V21.pdf |title=Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual Reports |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society|page=16|accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Woolwich was incorporated as a Township in 1816, and was part of Halton County until 1842 when it became part of Wellington District.

Previously, this area had few settlers, the most notable a Mr. Cox; the creek which enters the Grand River at what is now Winterbourne was named after him. Immigrants from Scotland began settling the Cox Creek area in 1834, led by John Davidson. He opened the first post office in the township, naming it East Woolwich. Captain Henry Lanphier arrived in 1854 and soon built a sawmill and flour mill after damming Cox Creek. Residents agreed with him that the settlement should be renamed [[Winterbourne, Ontario]]. By 1837, the Scots established St. Andrew's Presbyterian in 1837. A Presbyterian church was not built until 1870, made of logs; it was replaced in 1870 by one built of brick, and is currently a private home near the Winterbourne Presbyterian Cemetery. By 1867, Winterbourne  had a population of 160, three churches, a school, a post office, a general store, two mills, two hotels, two blacksmiths, a tailor, shoemaker and a physician.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mills |first1=Rych |title=Flash from the Past: A Scottish enclave in Woolwich Township |url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7607547-flash-from-the-past-a-scottish-enclave-in-woolwich-township/ |accessdate=May 22, 2019 |work=Waterloo Region Record |publisher=Metroland News |date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n \nSt. Jacobs, like nearby Conestogo (both in Woolwich), was primarily Germanic and was first settled in 1830.<ref name=\"StJacobs\">{{cite web |title=Woolwich Township |url=https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/woolwich-township.aspx |publisher=Ken Seiling Waterloo Region Museum |accessdate=May 22, 2019}} (section \"St. Jacobs\")</ref> In 1834, Edward Bristow from Sussex, England<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcburney.ca/mcburney/3252.htm |title=Hannah Streater|publisher=Lloyd McBurney |accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref> became one of Elmira's first settlers when he purchased {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of land at this location for 50 cents per acre.

He built a sawmill in 1844 and after damming the Conestoga River, he added a flour mill and a second sawmill. The hamlet formed in this area, known as Musselman's Mills until 1852 when it became Conestoga because many of the settlers had come from the Conestoga River area of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"WHSp16\"/> Records about the entire township from 1846 indicate that the area was thinly settled although the land was excellent and there were large tracts of hardwood. There were two grist and two saw mills and an Episcopal church. The population count in 1841 indicated 1009 people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Farmer and pioneer industrialist Jacob C. Snider, of Swiss German descent, was the most important settler at the time and the community was named after him: Jakobstettel (Jacob's Village). He built a dam to power several mills and then built a sawmill, woolen mill and flour mill by 1852.

The first settlers arrived in the late 18th century. In 1798, William Wallace was one of the first settlers after he was deeded 86,078 acres (348 km2) of land on the Grand River for a cost of $16,364. Originally Block three of Indian Lands, this area now comprises a large part of Woolwich Township. The parcel of land called \"Woolwich\" was probably named (in 1816) after a town in Kent, England. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland until about 1830; they settled to the east of the Grand River. Afterwards, German Mennonite families from Pennsylvania and from Waterloo Township settled west of the river.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woolwich Township |url=https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/woolwich-township.aspx |publisher=Ken Seiling Waterloo Region Museum |accessdate=May 22, 2019}} (section \"History of Woolwich Township\")</ref>\n\nIn 1807, Wallace sold the major portion of his tract to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, trustees for the German Company, many of whom would settle this area.<ref>{{cite book | title = County of Waterloo Gazetteer and General Business Directory, For 1864 | publisher = Mitchell & Co. | year = 1864 | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf | pages = 61}}</ref> Wallace sold {{convert|45185|acre|km2|0}} of land to the German Company at $1.00 an acre.

Their large log home served as an inn for travelers and he operated a stagecoach for carrying mail from 1835 to 1850.

Previously, this area had few settlers, the most notable a Mr. Cox; the creek which enters the Grand River at what is now Winterbourne was named after him. Immigrants from Scotland began settling the Cox Creek area in 1834, led by John Davidson. He opened the first post office in the township, naming it East Woolwich. Captain Henry Lanphier arrived in 1854 and soon built a sawmill and flour mill after damming Cox Creek. Residents agreed with him that the settlement should be renamed [[Winterbourne, Ontario]]. By 1837, the Scots established St. Andrew's Presbyterian in 1837. A Presbyterian church was not built until 1870, made of logs; it was replaced in 1870 by one built of brick, and is currently a private home near the Winterbourne Presbyterian Cemetery. By 1867, Winterbourne  had a population of 160, three churches, a school, a post office, a general store, two mills, two hotels, two blacksmiths, a tailor, shoemaker and a physician.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mills |first1=Rych |title=Flash from the Past: A Scottish enclave in Woolwich Township |url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7607547-flash-from-the-past-a-scottish-enclave-in-woolwich-township/ |accessdate=May 22, 2019 |work=Waterloo Region Record |publisher=Metroland News |date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n \nSt. Jacobs, like nearby Conestogo (both in Woolwich), was primarily Germanic and was first settled in 1830.<ref name=\"StJacobs\">{{cite web |title=Woolwich Township |url=https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/woolwich-township.aspx |publisher=Ken Seiling Waterloo Region Museum |accessdate=May 22, 2019}} (section \"St. Jacobs\")</ref> In 1834, Edward Bristow from Sussex, England<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcburney.ca/mcburney/3252.htm |title=Hannah Streater|publisher=Lloyd McBurney |accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref> became one of Elmira's first settlers when he purchased {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of land at this location for 50 cents per acre.

He built a sawmill in 1844 and after damming the Conestoga River, he added a flour mill and a second sawmill. The hamlet formed in this area, known as Musselman's Mills until 1852 when it became Conestoga because many of the settlers had come from the Conestoga River area of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"WHSp16\"/> Records about the entire township from 1846 indicate that the area was thinly settled although the land was excellent and there were large tracts of hardwood.

He built a dam to power several mills and then built a sawmill, woolen mill and flour mill by 1852.

As a youth, he played in the 1980 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with a [[minor ice hockey]] team from [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nTugnutt played three seasons with the [[Peterborough Petes]] in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], and won the [[F. W. \"Dinty\" Moore Trophy]] for the rookie with the best [[goals against average]], followed by the [[Dave Pinkney Trophy]] for Top Team Goaltending, and was named to the OHL All Star team in 1987.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n===NHL beginnings===\nHe was drafted by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the 4th round (87th overall) of the [[1986 NHL Entry Draft]]. He was primarily used as a backup during his first three pro seasons, bouncing up and down between the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]'s [[Halifax Citadels]] and the parent club in [[Quebec City]]. During [[1990\u201391 NHL season]], Tugnutt played what would be a career high 56 games for Quebec and established himself as a quality NHL starter despite playing for what was then the worst team in the league.\n\nOn March 21, 1991, Tugnutt stopped 70 of 73 shots to earn his team a 3-3 tie against the [[Boston Bruins]], the second highest number of saves made in a regular season game in NHL history. His performance in that game evoked such respect that after it was over, several Bruins players skated over to congratulate Tugnutt.<ref>New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDC1731F930A15750C0A967958260 March 21, 1991]</ref> The hometown Bruins fans gave him a standing ovation after the game ended as well.\n\nIn the midst of an inconsistent [[1991\u201392 NHL season]], and with the emergence of [[St\u00e9phane Fiset]] as the Nordiques' #1 goaltender, Tugnutt was demoted to the Nordiques' AHL affiliate. In exchange for [[Martin Ru\u010d\u00ednsk\u00fd]], he was soon traded to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to serve as [[Bill Ranford]]'s backup. Tugnutt remained in this role until he was selected by the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[1993 NHL Expansion Draft|1993 expansion draft]]. In Anaheim, he split goaltending duties with [[Guy Hebert]].\n\nAs Anaheim quickly decided that Hebert was to be their future starter, and as the [[Montreal Canadiens]] decided that [[Andr\u00e9 Racicot]] and [[Les Kuntar]] were not adequately serving as [[Patrick Roy]]'s backup, Tugnutt was acquired by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in exchange for [[Stephan Lebeau]]. In his new role, Tugnutt's performance suffered; for Anaheim he posted a .908 save percentage in 28 games. For Montreal, he posted an .860 save percentage in eight games during the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 season]].\n\nDuring the 1994 [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs against the [[Boston Bruins]], Tugnutt started a match as starter Patrick Roy was recuperating from an [[appendectomy]]. He did not return to the Canadiens for the [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]], and was replaced by [[Patrick Labrecque]]. These experiences caused Tugnutt to ponder retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=199&hubname=nhl|title=404|website=TSN}}</ref>\n\n===Career breakthrough===\nIn 1995, Tugnutt signed a one-year deal with the [[Washington Capitals]], and subsequently spent the entire 1995-96 season with their AHL affiliate, the [[Portland Pirates]]. He was productive in Portland, helping lead the Pirates to the [[Calder Cup]] Finals.<ref>The AHL.com, [http://www.theahl.com/AHLNews96-97/apr23_ron.html Portland rejuvanates Tugnutt's career]</ref>\n\nIt was this strong performance that caught the attention of the [[Ottawa Senators]]. With the help of goaltending coach [[Phil Myre]], Tugnutt worked on the fundamentals, gained some confidence and improved his game each season. While in Ottawa, he went from fighting for the backup position with [[Mike Bales]] behind starter [[Damian Rhodes]] to splitting duties with Rhodes the next two seasons and becoming the team's undisputed starting goaltender by 1999.\n\nOn April 12, 1997, Tugnutt backstopped the Senators to a 1-0 shutout of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in the final game of the regular season. Tugnutt's father had just died and immediately following the win Tugnutt pointed to the rafters to signify the win was for his father. The moment was captured by cameras and became an iconic image of Tugnutt. This win propelled the Senators to their first playoff berth.<ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\">{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/hockey/team-tugnutt-relishes-time-together-as-a-hockey-family|title=Team Tugnutt relishes time together as a hockey family (with video)|date=11 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Tugnutt had the best season of his career, and one of the best by an NHL goaltender in the modern era. He posted a league-best [[goals against average]] of 1.79, placed second in the league in save percentage at .925, had a career high in wins, and tied a career high in shutouts. This outstanding play, and an injury to [[Curtis Joseph]], gave Tugnutt the opportunity to play in the 1999 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]].\n\nThe next season, Rhodes was shipped to the expansion [[Atlanta Thrashers]], giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, he was unable to match his previous season and Ottawa decided to trade him to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in favor of an experienced playoff performer, [[Tom Barrasso]].\n\nAfter arriving in Pittsburgh, Tugnutt took over the starting job from [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Aubin]] and helped lead Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs. Tugnutt was in goal for the May 4, 2000, playoff game against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. He made 70 saves on 72 shots.  The 72nd shot was a goal scored by [[Keith Primeau]] of the Flyers at 12:01 of the fifth [[overtime (hockey)|overtime]].  The final score was Philadelphia 2, Pittsburgh 1, after 152:01 minutes, the longest NHL game since the 1930s.\n\nFollowing his performance with Pittsburgh, Tugnutt became one of the most sought after [[free agent]] goaltenders on the market. Both Ottawa and Pittsburgh attempted to re-sign Tugnutt but were unable to match the lucrative contract offered by the expansion [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].<ref>Post-Gazette, [http://www.post-gazette.com/penguins/20000630pens2.asp Sens want Tugnutt Back, Tugnutt hot on free agent market]</ref><ref>Canoe Sports Slam Hockey, [http://www.canoe.ca/HockeyColumbusArchive/jul4_tug.html Tugnutt Signs with Columbus]</ref>\n\nDuring Columbus' inaugural season, Tugnutt was considered their backbone. Tugnutt's 22 wins broke another NHL record for most wins on an [[expansion team]], and his .917 save percentage was among the best in the league.<ref>The Sports Network, [http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=nhl/misc/canamucio_archive/crashin_net_nov22.htm Tugnutt was the backbone to Columbus]</ref>\n\nThe team's second season was not as impressive as the first. Tugnutt battled injuries and ended up sharing time with young netminder [[Marc Denis]]. GM [[Doug MacLean]] decided that it was time to give Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>HockeyInformer.com, [http://www.hockeyinformer.com/web/fantasy/editorials/editorial1.shtml Denis had potential to be starter]</ref>\n\nTugnutt went to the Dallas Stars in [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303]] as the backup to goaltender [[Marty Turco]]. In January 2003, Turco suffered an ankle injury that allowed Tugnutt to start almost 20 straight games. He posted back to back shutouts during that stretch. For the season, he played 31 games and posted a 15-10-5 record along with four shutouts.\n\n[[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304]] was possibly Tugnutt's toughest in the NHL. From the start of the season to January he only received three starts. He was sent down to the minors for the first time in almost ten years to get some playing time with the [[Utah Grizzlies]]. Just five games in, Tugnutt pulled his groin and was out until after the All Star break.<ref>AllSports.com,[http://www.allsports.com/cgi-bin/showstory.cgi?story_id=47393 Tugnutt pulls groin in minors]</ref> Soon after, he was recalled to the Dallas Stars. After two solid starts, one of which was a shutout, Tugnutt finally got the break he was waiting for as Turco received a four-game suspension.<ref>ESPN, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1768163 Turco Suspended 4 Games]</ref> He retired following the 2003-04 season.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nAfter the lockout, Tugnutt joined [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] as a [[color commentator]] for [[Hockey Night in Canada]].<ref>SLAM!

Tugnutt was a consultant with Hockey Canada until 2013 when that relationship ended. Tugnutt then moved behind the bench of his sons' team the Kemptville 73's.<ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\"/>\n\n==Off the ice==\nTugnutt is married to wife Lisa, and the couple have two sons, Jacob and Matthew. The family resides on Stoney Lake near [[Peterborough, Ontario]].\n\nTugnutt enjoys boating and traveling. In the summer of 1998, Tugnutt was involved in a severe boating accident. It was suspected that he might miss out on training camp. Tugnutt healed and had the best season of his career, breaking the modern-day NHL record for lowest G.A.A. and coming 2nd in the league in save percentage.<ref>Hockey Goalies, [http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/tugnutt.html Tugnutt Profile, and boating accident]</ref>\n\nTugnutt previously owned the [[Kemptville 73's]], a [[Junior ice hockey|Junior \"A\" ice hockey]] team, where he served as head coach, president and governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cchlkemptville.pointstreaksites.com/view/cchlkemptville/team-67/management|title=Management - CJHL: Kemptville 73s Jr. A|website=cchlkemptville.pointstreaksites.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cchlkemptville.pointstreaksites.com/view/cchlkemptville/team-67/hockey-operations|title=Hockey Operations - CJHL: Kemptville 73s Jr. A|website=cchlkemptville.pointstreaksites.com}}</ref><ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\"/> Tugnutt sold the team to an ownership group led by former teammate [[Jason York]].\n\n==Honours and records==\n* Modern-day record holder for most saves in a regular season game non-loss (stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3-3 tie with the [[Boston Bruins]]; March 21, 1991).\n* Holds [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] record for most saves in a regular season game with 46, set against the [[Edmonton Oilers]] on November 21, 1993).\n* Tied with [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek]] for Ottawa Senators highest regular season save percentage.\n* Leader in [[save percentage]] for the 1999\u20132000 Playoffs.\n* Holds Pittsburgh Penguins record for highest save percentage in the playoffs.\n* Has Division named in his honour in the FCHL.\n\n==International play==\nAfter a disappointing 4-game sweep in the [[Season structure of the NHL|NHL playoffs]], Tugnutt was more than excited to play for [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] in the 1999 [[World Hockey Championship]]. The semi-final game was against the [[Czech Republic]] in which Canada lost after the game went undecided in overtime, ending in a shootout. This was Tugnutt's second appearance on Team Canada.

As a youth, he played in the 1980 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with a [[minor ice hockey]] team from [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nTugnutt played three seasons with the [[Peterborough Petes]] in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], and won the [[F. W. \"Dinty\" Moore Trophy]] for the rookie with the best [[goals against average]], followed by the [[Dave Pinkney Trophy]] for Top Team Goaltending, and was named to the OHL All Star team in 1987.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n===NHL beginnings===\nHe was drafted by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the 4th round (87th overall) of the [[1986 NHL Entry Draft]]. He was primarily used as a backup during his first three pro seasons, bouncing up and down between the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]'s [[Halifax Citadels]] and the parent club in [[Quebec City]]. During [[1990\u201391 NHL season]], Tugnutt played what would be a career high 56 games for Quebec and established himself as a quality NHL starter despite playing for what was then the worst team in the league.\n\nOn March 21, 1991, Tugnutt stopped 70 of 73 shots to earn his team a 3-3 tie against the [[Boston Bruins]], the second highest number of saves made in a regular season game in NHL history. His performance in that game evoked such respect that after it was over, several Bruins players skated over to congratulate Tugnutt.<ref>New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDC1731F930A15750C0A967958260 March 21, 1991]</ref> The hometown Bruins fans gave him a standing ovation after the game ended as well.\n\nIn the midst of an inconsistent [[1991\u201392 NHL season]], and with the emergence of [[St\u00e9phane Fiset]] as the Nordiques' #1 goaltender, Tugnutt was demoted to the Nordiques' AHL affiliate. In exchange for [[Martin Ru\u010d\u00ednsk\u00fd]], he was soon traded to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to serve as [[Bill Ranford]]'s backup. Tugnutt remained in this role until he was selected by the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[1993 NHL Expansion Draft|1993 expansion draft]]. In Anaheim, he split goaltending duties with [[Guy Hebert]].\n\nAs Anaheim quickly decided that Hebert was to be their future starter, and as the [[Montreal Canadiens]] decided that [[Andr\u00e9 Racicot]] and [[Les Kuntar]] were not adequately serving as [[Patrick Roy]]'s backup, Tugnutt was acquired by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in exchange for [[Stephan Lebeau]]. In his new role, Tugnutt's performance suffered; for Anaheim he posted a .908 save percentage in 28 games. For Montreal, he posted an .860 save percentage in eight games during the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 season]].\n\nDuring the 1994 [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs against the [[Boston Bruins]], Tugnutt started a match as starter Patrick Roy was recuperating from an [[appendectomy]]. He did not return to the Canadiens for the [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]], and was replaced by [[Patrick Labrecque]]. These experiences caused Tugnutt to ponder retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=199&hubname=nhl|title=404|website=TSN}}</ref>\n\n===Career breakthrough===\nIn 1995, Tugnutt signed a one-year deal with the [[Washington Capitals]], and subsequently spent the entire 1995-96 season with their AHL affiliate, the [[Portland Pirates]]. He was productive in Portland, helping lead the Pirates to the [[Calder Cup]] Finals.<ref>The AHL.com, [http://www.theahl.com/AHLNews96-97/apr23_ron.html Portland rejuvanates Tugnutt's career]</ref>\n\nIt was this strong performance that caught the attention of the [[Ottawa Senators]]. With the help of goaltending coach [[Phil Myre]], Tugnutt worked on the fundamentals, gained some confidence and improved his game each season. While in Ottawa, he went from fighting for the backup position with [[Mike Bales]] behind starter [[Damian Rhodes]] to splitting duties with Rhodes the next two seasons and becoming the team's undisputed starting goaltender by 1999.\n\nOn April 12, 1997, Tugnutt backstopped the Senators to a 1-0 shutout of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in the final game of the regular season. Tugnutt's father had just died and immediately following the win Tugnutt pointed to the rafters to signify the win was for his father. The moment was captured by cameras and became an iconic image of Tugnutt. This win propelled the Senators to their first playoff berth.<ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\">{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/hockey/team-tugnutt-relishes-time-together-as-a-hockey-family|title=Team Tugnutt relishes time together as a hockey family (with video)|date=11 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Tugnutt had the best season of his career, and one of the best by an NHL goaltender in the modern era. He posted a league-best [[goals against average]] of 1.79, placed second in the league in save percentage at .925, had a career high in wins, and tied a career high in shutouts. This outstanding play, and an injury to [[Curtis Joseph]], gave Tugnutt the opportunity to play in the 1999 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]].\n\nThe next season, Rhodes was shipped to the expansion [[Atlanta Thrashers]], giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, he was unable to match his previous season and Ottawa decided to trade him to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in favor of an experienced playoff performer, [[Tom Barrasso]].\n\nAfter arriving in Pittsburgh, Tugnutt took over the starting job from [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Aubin]] and helped lead Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs. Tugnutt was in goal for the May 4, 2000, playoff game against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. He made 70 saves on 72 shots.  The 72nd shot was a goal scored by [[Keith Primeau]] of the Flyers at 12:01 of the fifth [[overtime (hockey)|overtime]].  The final score was Philadelphia 2, Pittsburgh 1, after 152:01 minutes, the longest NHL game since the 1930s.\n\nFollowing his performance with Pittsburgh, Tugnutt became one of the most sought after [[free agent]] goaltenders on the market. Both Ottawa and Pittsburgh attempted to re-sign Tugnutt but were unable to match the lucrative contract offered by the expansion [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].<ref>Post-Gazette, [http://www.post-gazette.com/penguins/20000630pens2.asp Sens want Tugnutt Back, Tugnutt hot on free agent market]</ref><ref>Canoe Sports Slam Hockey, [http://www.canoe.ca/HockeyColumbusArchive/jul4_tug.html Tugnutt Signs with Columbus]</ref>\n\nDuring Columbus' inaugural season, Tugnutt was considered their backbone. Tugnutt's 22 wins broke another NHL record for most wins on an [[expansion team]], and his .917 save percentage was among the best in the league.<ref>The Sports Network, [http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=nhl/misc/canamucio_archive/crashin_net_nov22.htm Tugnutt was the backbone to Columbus]</ref>\n\nThe team's second season was not as impressive as the first. Tugnutt battled injuries and ended up sharing time with young netminder [[Marc Denis]]. GM [[Doug MacLean]] decided that it was time to give Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>HockeyInformer.com, [http://www.hockeyinformer.com/web/fantasy/editorials/editorial1.shtml Denis had potential to be starter]</ref>\n\nTugnutt went to the Dallas Stars in [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303]] as the backup to goaltender [[Marty Turco]]. In January 2003, Turco suffered an ankle injury that allowed Tugnutt to start almost 20 straight games. He posted back to back shutouts during that stretch. For the season, he played 31 games and posted a 15-10-5 record along with four shutouts.\n\n[[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304]] was possibly Tugnutt's toughest in the NHL. From the start of the season to January he only received three starts. He was sent down to the minors for the first time in almost ten years to get some playing time with the [[Utah Grizzlies]].

Although his precise parentage hasn't completely been proven, he was certainly an [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynast, and a descendant of [[Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n, King of Northumbria and Dublin]].\n\nGodred first appears on record in the context of supporting the Norwegian invasion of England in 1066. Following the collapse of this campaign, Godred is recorded to have arrived on [[Isle of Man|Mann]], at the court of [[Gofraid mac Sitriuc (d. 1070)|Gofraid mac Sitriuc, King of the Isles]], a likely kinsman of his. During the 1070s, the latter died and was succeeded by his son, [[Fingal mac Gofraid|Fingal]]. Within the decade, Godred violently seized the kingship for himself, although the exact circumstances surrounding this takeover are uncertain. By 1091, Godred attained the kingship of Dublin, and thereby secured complete control of the valuable trade routes through the Irish Sea region. Godred's expansion may be further perceptible in the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde estuary]] and [[Galloway]], and may well have forced the English to consolidate control of [[Cumberland]] in an effort to secure their western maritime flank. Godred appears to have drawn his power from the [[Hebrides]]; and archaeological evidence from Mann reveals that, in comparison to the decades previous to his takeover, the island seems to have enjoyed a period of relative peace.\n\nDuring his reign, Godred appears to have lent military assistance to [[Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd]], a probable kinsman, who was then locked in continuous conflicts with Welsh rivals and encroaching English magnates. The earliest known [[Bishops of the Isles]] date from about the time of Godred's reign, although it is almost certain that earlier ecclesiastes held this position. It may have been just prior to Godred's accession in the Isles, whilst Dublin was under the ultimate control of [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster]], that Dublin and the Isles were ecclesiastically separated once and for all. Godred's rule in Dublin came to an abrupt end in 1094 with his expulsion at the hands of [[Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster]], a man who may have even driven Godred from Mann as well. Documentary evidence reveals that the last decade of the eleventh century saw an upsurge in plague and famine. According to Irish sources, one quarter of Ireland perished from pestilence in 1095 alone. One of the fatalities was Godred himself, who died on [[Islay]], an apparent power centre in the Isles.\n\nGodred's greatest impact on history may have been his founding of the [[Crovan dynasty]], his patrilineal descendants who ruled in the Isles for almost two centuries. Godred was an important maternal ancestor of [[Clann Somairle]], a family that held power in the Isles centuries after the final extinction of the Crovan dynasty. As such, he may be identical to [[Gofraid mac Fergusa]], an apparent genealogical construct claimed as a Clann Somairle ancestor. Godred may well be identical to the celebrated King Orry of Manx legend, a figure traditionally credited with instituting the [[Manx law|Manx legal system]]. Godred and King Orry are associated with numerous historic and prehistoric sites on Mann and Islay.\n\n==Familial origins==\n\n[[File:Gofraid Crob\u00e1n (map).png|left|upright|thumb|alt=Map of Britain and Ireland|Locations relating to Godred's life and times.]]\n\nWhile the familial origins of Godred Crovan aren't completely proven, it appears certain that he was a direct descendant of [[Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n, King of Northumbria and Dublin]].<ref>[[#D1|Duffy (2004a)]].</ref> Although the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'' calls him in Latin \"... {{lang|la|filius Haraldi nigri de Ysland}}\",<ref>[[#M23|McDonald (2012)]] p. 164; [[#M2|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 62; [[#D3|Duffy (2006)]] p. 60; [[#H1|Hudson, BT (2005)]] p. 171; [[#D1|Duffy (2004a)]]; [[#D16|Duffy (2002a)]] p. 55 n. 8; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 190 n. 16; [[#S8|Sellar (1997\u20131998)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (1997)]] p. 33; [[#T6|Thornton (1996)]] p. 95; [[#D18|Duffy (1993a)]] p. 35 n. 18; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 106; [[#B10|Broderick; Stowell (1973)]] p. 61; [[#A3|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 43\u201344 n. 6; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874a)]] pp. 50\u201351, 144.</ref> implying that his father was named Aralt,<ref name=\"D3-60\">[[#D3|Duffy (2006)]] p. 60.</ref> the fourteenth-century ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' instead calls him in Gaelic \"... {{lang|ghc|mac Maic Arailt}}\",<ref>[[#T1|''The Annals of Tigernach'' (2010)]] \u00a7 1091.5; [[#M2|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 61\u201362; [[#D3|Duffy (2006)]] p. 60; [[#A4|''Annals of Tigernach'' (2005)]] \u00a7 1091.5; [[#H1|Hudson, BT (2005)]] p. 171; [[#D1|Duffy (2004a)]]; [[#D16|Duffy (2002a)]] p. 55; [[#M4|McDonald (1997)]] p. 33; [[#T6|Thornton (1996)]] p. 95; [[#D18|Duffy (1993a)]] p. 35; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> contrarily implying that it was Godred's grandfather who was named Aralt.<ref name=\"D3-60\"/> Godred, therefore, may have been either a son,<ref name=\"parentage1\">[[#M24|McDonald (2019)]] pp. 22, 27 n. 4; [[#M13|McDonald (2008)]] pp. 133, 133\u2013134 n. 12; [[#M2|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 62, 62 n. 18; [[#D3|Duffy (2006)]] pp. 53, 60; [[#H1|Hudson, BT (2005)]] pp. 54, 83 fig. 3, 171; [[#D1|Duffy (2004a)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2004)]] p. 100; [[#D16|Duffy (2002a)]] pp. 55\u201356; [[#M4|McDonald (1997)]] p. 33; [[#D18|Duffy (1993a)]] p. 35; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 106.</ref> nephew,<ref>[[#M24|McDonald (2019)]] p. 27 n. 4; [[#M13|McDonald (2008)]] pp. 133\u2013134 n. 12; [[#M2|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 62 n. 18; [[#D1|Duffy (2004a)]]; [[#D16|Duffy (2002a)]] pp. 55\u201356; [[#D18|Duffy (1993a)]] p. 35; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 106; [[#M4|McDonald (1997)]] p. 33.</ref> or brother of [[\u00cdmar mac Arailt, King of Dublin]].<ref>[[#W1|Woolf (2004)]] p. 100.</ref>{{#tag:ref|In 1044, \u00cdmar launched a devastating raid into [[Armagh]].

One such tale, alleged by Livingstone to have been \"handed down from the Danish mythologists of those days\", concerns exploits of Godred in the island's [[Loch Indaal]] vicinity. Livingstone's versions of such local traditions appear to be the inspiration behind his epic Gaelic battle-poem ''Na Lochlannaich an Ile'' (\"The Norsemen in Islay\").<ref>[[#K4|Kidd (2006)]]; [[#W12|Whyte (1991)]] pp. 175\u2013176; [[#L9|Livingston (1882)]] pp. 1\u201337; [[#L8|Livingston (1850)]] pp. 147\u2013150.</ref> The Gaelic folk song ''Birlinn Ghoraidh Chr\u00f3bhain'', sometimes called ''Birlinn Ghoraidh Chrobhain'' and ''Godred Crovan's Galley'', was composed by [[Duncan Johnston (songwriter)|Duncan Johnston]], and released in part one of his 1938 book ''Cronan nan Tonn''.

Although his precise parentage hasn't completely been proven, he was certainly an [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynast, and a descendant of [[Amla\u00edb C\u00faar\u00e1n, King of Northumbria and Dublin]].\n\nGodred first appears on record in the context of supporting the Norwegian invasion of England in 1066. Following the collapse of this campaign, Godred is recorded to have arrived on [[Isle of Man|Mann]], at the court of [[Gofraid mac Sitriuc (d. 1070)|Gofraid mac Sitriuc, King of the Isles]], a likely kinsman of his. During the 1070s, the latter died and was succeeded by his son, [[Fingal mac Gofraid|Fingal]]. Within the decade, Godred violently seized the kingship for himself, although the exact circumstances surrounding this takeover are uncertain. By 1091, Godred attained the kingship of Dublin, and thereby secured complete control of the valuable trade routes through the Irish Sea region. Godred's expansion may be further perceptible in the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde estuary]] and [[Galloway]], and may well have forced the English to consolidate control of [[Cumberland]] in an effort to secure their western maritime flank. Godred appears to have drawn his power from the [[Hebrides]]; and archaeological evidence from Mann reveals that, in comparison to the decades previous to his takeover, the island seems to have enjoyed a period of relative peace.\n\nDuring his reign, Godred appears to have lent military assistance to [[Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd]], a probable kinsman, who was then locked in continuous conflicts with Welsh rivals and encroaching English magnates. The earliest known [[Bishops of the Isles]] date from about the time of Godred's reign, although it is almost certain that earlier ecclesiastes held this position. It may have been just prior to Godred's accession in the Isles, whilst Dublin was under the ultimate control of [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster]], that Dublin and the Isles were ecclesiastically separated once and for all. Godred's rule in Dublin came to an abrupt end in 1094 with his expulsion at the hands of [[Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster]], a man who may have even driven Godred from Mann as well. Documentary evidence reveals that the last decade of the eleventh century saw an upsurge in plague and famine. According to Irish sources, one quarter of Ireland perished from pestilence in 1095 alone. One of the fatalities was Godred himself, who died on [[Islay]], an apparent power centre in the Isles.\n\nGodred's greatest impact on history may have been his founding of the [[Crovan dynasty]], his patrilineal descendants who ruled in the Isles for almost two centuries. Godred was an important maternal ancestor of [[Clann Somairle]], a family that held power in the Isles centuries after the final extinction of the Crovan dynasty.

One such tale, alleged by Livingstone to have been \"handed down from the Danish mythologists of those days\", concerns exploits of Godred in the island's [[Loch Indaal]] vicinity. Livingstone's versions of such local traditions appear to be the inspiration behind his epic Gaelic battle-poem ''Na Lochlannaich an Ile'' (\"The Norsemen in Islay\").<ref>[[#K4|Kidd (2006)]]; [[#W12|Whyte (1991)]] pp. 175\u2013176; [[#L9|Livingston (1882)]] pp. 1\u201337; [[#L8|Livingston (1850)]] pp. 147\u2013150.</ref> The Gaelic folk song ''Birlinn Ghoraidh Chr\u00f3bhain'', sometimes called ''Birlinn Ghoraidh Chrobhain'' and ''Godred Crovan's Galley'', was composed by [[Duncan Johnston (songwriter)|Duncan Johnston]], and released in part one of his 1938 book ''Cronan nan Tonn''.

His work extended to many fields including eradication of [[untouchability]] and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], and women's [[emancipation]].He is mostly known for his efforts in educating women and lower caste people. He and his wife, [[Savitribai Phule]], were pioneers of women education in India.

People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed classes. Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Lagrange.\n\n==Early life==\nPhule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the [[Mali_caste|Mali]] caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners, vegetable vendors, and florists, and considered to be one of the Shudra varnas in the ritual ranking system of Hinduism.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present-day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a ''chaugula'', a lowly type of village servant, in that village but moved to Khanwadi in [[Pune district]]. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved himself and his family, including three boys, to [[Pune|Poona]] in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist, who taught them his trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} Their fulfillment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings,  Jyotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}}\n\nGovindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger. Chimnabai died before he was aged one.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} The Mali community did not make room for much by education, and after attending primary school to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, Jyotirao was withdrawn from school. He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm. However, a Christian convert from the same Mali caste as Phule recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule's father to allow Phule to attend the local Scottish Mission High School.<ref name=\"RobinsonKujur2010\">{{cite book|author1=Rowena Robinson|author2=Joseph Marianus Kujur|title=Margins of Faith: Dalit and Tribal Christianity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRtBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|date=17 August 2010|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|isbn=978-93-86042-93-4}}</ref>{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|The Scottish Mission school was operated by the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and educated pupils from a wide range of castes.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=105|ps=}}}} Phule completed his English schooling in 1847.

Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Lagrange.\n\n==Early life==\nPhule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the [[Mali_caste|Mali]] caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners, vegetable vendors, and florists, and considered to be one of the Shudra varnas in the ritual ranking system of Hinduism.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present-day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a ''chaugula'', a lowly type of village servant, in that village but moved to Khanwadi in [[Pune district]]. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved himself and his family, including three boys, to [[Pune|Poona]] in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist, who taught them his trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} Their fulfillment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings,  Jyotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}}\n\nGovindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger.

He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm.
