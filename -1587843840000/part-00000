The name of the character came into English from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which in turn came from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:titulus|titulus]]'', meaning \"title\" or \"superscription\".<ref name=ah/>\n\nThe reason for the name was that it was originally written over an omitted letter (or several letters) as a [[scribal abbreviation]] (or \"mark of suspension\" / \"mark of contraction\",<ref>Martin, Charles Trice (1910). The record interpreter : a collection of abbreviations, Latin words and names used in English historical manuscripts and records (2nd ed.). London, preface, p.5[https://archive.org/details/recordinterprete00martuoft/page/n9/mode/2up]</ref>) shown as a straight line when used with capitals. Thus the commonly used words ''[[Anno Domini]]'' were frequently abbreviated to ''A<sup>o</sup> D\u00f1i'', with an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the \"n\". Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe's labour and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full. \n\nThe tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a [[diacritic]] mark or a character in its own right. These are encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|0303|Combining Tilde|cwith=\u25cc}} and {{unichar|007e|Tilde|note=as a spacing character}}, and there are [[#Similar characters|additional similar characters]] for different roles. In [[lexicography]], the latter kind of tilde and the '''[[swung dash]]''' (\u2053) are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=swung+dash&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=000000000000 | title = WordNet | type = search | edition = 3.0 | contribution = Swung dash}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Use by medieval scribes===\n[[File:Text of Exeter Domesday Book of 1086.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Text of Exeter [[Domesday Book]] of 1086]]\n\nThe text of the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, relating for example, to the [[manor of Molland]] in [[Devon]] (see image left), is highly [[Scribal abbreviation|abbreviated]] as indicated by numerous tildes.

When all [[character set]]s were pieces of metal permanently installed, and number of characters much more limited than in [[typography]], the question of which languages and markets required which characters was an important one. Any good typewriter store had a catalog of alternative keyboards that could be specified for machines ordered from the factory.\n\nAt that time, the tilde was used only in Spanish and Portuguese typewriters (keyboards). In Modern Spanish, the tilde is used only with ''\u00f1'' and ''\u00d1''. Both were conveniently assigned to a single mechanical typebar, which sacrificed a key that was felt to be less important, usually the {{frac|1|2}}\u2014{{frac|1|4}} key.\n\nPortuguese, however, uses not ''\u00f1'' but ''nh''. It uses the tilde on the vowels ''a'' and ''o''. So as not to sacrifice two of the tightly limited keys to \u00e3 \u00c3 \u00f5 \u00d5, the decision was made to make the ~ a separate \"dead\" character in which the carriage holding the paper did not move. [[Dead key]]s, which had a notch cut out to avoid hitting a mechanical linkage that triggered carriage movement, were used for characters that were intended to be combined (overstruck).\n\nOn mechanical typewriters, Spanish keyboards (the first, or one of the first, non-English keyboards) had a dead key, which contained the [[acute accent]] (\u00b4), used over any vowel, and the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] (\u00a8), used only over ''u''. It was a simple matter to create a dead key for a Portuguese keyboard (created later than the Spanish one) to be overstruck with ''a'' and ''o'' and so the ~ was born as a typographical character, which did not exist previously as a [[sort (typesetting)|type]] or [[Hot metal typesetting|hot-lead]] printing character. That was probably a product of the first and leading manufacturer of (mechanical) typewriters, [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington]].\n\n==Connection to Spanish==\n{{Main|\u00d1}}\n[[File:Logotipo del Instituto Cervantes.svg|thumbnail|left|Logo of the Instituto Cervantes]]\n[[File:Logo de CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.svg|thumbnail|right|Logo of CNN en Espa\u00f1ol]]\nAs indicated by the etymological origin of the word \"tilde\" in English, this symbol has been closely associated with the [[Spanish language]]. The connection stems from the use of the tilde above the letter \"n\" to form \"\u00f1\" in Spanish, a feature shared by only [[Tilde#Palatal n|a few other languages]], all historically connected to Spanish. This peculiarity can help non-native speakers quickly identify a text as being written in Spanish with little chance of error. In addition, most native speakers, although [[names given to the Spanish language|not all]], use the word \"espa'''\u00f1'''ol\" to refer to their language. Particularly during the 1990s, Spanish-speaking intellectuals and news outlets demonstrated support for the language and the culture by defending this letter against [[globalisation]] and [[computer]]isation trends that threatened to remove it from keyboards and other standardised products and codes.<ref>{{cite web|title=26 argumentos para seguir defendiendo la \u00d1|url=http://www.larazon.es/historico/651-26-argumentos-para-seguir-defendiendo-la-n-SLLA_RAZON_352314#.Ttt1ZN8CWth9pio|website=La Raz\u00f3n|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=11 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/internacionales/batalla-de-la-n-una-aventura-quijotesca-para-defender-el-alma-de-la-lengua-797718.html |title=Batalla de la \u00d1: Una aventura quijotesca para defender el alma de la lengua |last=AFP |date=18 November 2004 |website=Peri\u00f3dico ABC Paraguay |access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Instituto Cervantes]], founded by [[Spanish government|Spain's government]] to promote the Spanish language internationally, chose as its logo a highly stylised \u00d1 with a large tilde. The 24-hour news channel [[CNN]] in the US later adopted a similar strategy on its existing logo for the launch of its [[CNN en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish-language version]]. And similarly to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[Spain men's national basketball team]] is nicknamed ''\u00d1BA''.\n\nIn Spanish itself the word ''tilde'' is used more generally for diacritics, including the stress-marking acute accent.<ref>[http://dle.rae.es/?id=ZkHNOE8 Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola], Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola</ref>  The diacritic ''~'' is more commonly called  ''virgulilla'' or ''la tilde de la e\u00f1e'', and is not considered an accent mark in Spanish, but rather simply a part of the letter \u00f1 (much like [[tittle|the dot over the i]]).\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Common use===\nThis symbol (in US English) informally<ref name=wolfram_tilde /> means [[approximation|\"approximately\"]], \"about\", or \"around\", such as \"~30 minutes before\", meaning \"''approximately'' 30 minutes before\".<ref name=\"bymath1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.bymath.com/symbols/symbols.html | title =All Elementary Mathematics \u2013 Mathematical symbols dictionary |publisher=Bymath | accessdate =11 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.aspx|title=Character design standards - Maths|publisher=}}</ref> It can mean \"similar to\",<ref name=\"htmlhelp1\">{{cite web| first =Liam | last = Quinn |url=http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html |title=HTML 4.0 Entities for Symbols and Greek Letters |publisher=HTML help |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> including \"of the same [[order of magnitude]] as\",<ref name=wolfram_tilde>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html | publisher = Wolfram/MathWorld | title = Tilde |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> such as: \"{{math |{{mvar |x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}\" meaning that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are of the same order of magnitude.

In the computing field, especially in [[Unix]] based systems, the tilde indicates the user's home directory.\n\n===Diacritical use===\nIn some languages, the tilde is used as a [[diacritic]]al mark (''' \u02dc ''') placed over a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] to indicate a change in pronunciation, such as [[nasalization]].\n\n====Pitch====\nThe tilde was first used in the [[Greek diacritics|polytonic orthography]] of [[Ancient Greek]], as a variant of the [[circumflex]], representing a rise in [[pitch accent|pitch]] followed by a return to standard pitch.\n\n====Abbreviation====\n[[File:Hic Fabricatur Naves.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Carta marina]]'' showing Finnish economy, with the captions ''Hic fabricantur naves'' and ''Hic fabricantur [[Bombard (weapon)|bombarde]]'' abbreviated]]\nLater, it was used to make [[scribal abbreviation|abbreviations]] in medieval [[Latin language|Latin]] documents.  When an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} followed a vowel, it was often omitted, and a tilde (i.e., a small {{angle bracket|n}}) was placed over the preceding vowel to indicate the missing letter; this is the origin of the use of tilde to indicate nasalization  (compare [[Umlaut (diacritic)#Umlaut|the development of the umlaut]] as an abbreviation of {{angle bracket|e}}.)  The practice of using the tilde over a vowel to indicate omission of an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} continued in printed books in [[French language|French]] as a means of reducing text length until the 17th century. It was also used in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nThe tilde was also used occasionally to make other abbreviations, such as over the letter {{angle bracket|q}} (\"[[wikt:q\u0303|q\u0303]]\") to signify the word ''que'' (\"that\").\n\n====Nasalization====\nIt is also as a small {{angle bracket|n}} that the tilde originated when written above other letters, marking a [[Latin language|Latin]] {{angle bracket|n}} which had been [[elision|elided]] in old Galician-Portuguese.  In modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] it indicates [[nasalization]] of the base vowel: ''m\u00e3o'' \"hand\", from Lat. ''manu-''; ''raz\u00f5es'' \"reasons\", from Lat. ''rationes''.  This usage has been adopted in the orthographies of several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages of South America]], such as [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], as well as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and many other phonetic alphabets. For example, {{IPA|[lj\u0254\u0303]}} is the IPA transcription of the pronunciation of the French place-name ''[[Lyon]]''.\n\nIn [[Breton language|Breton]], the symbol {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} after a vowel means that the letter {{angle bracket|n}} serves only to give the vowel a nasalised pronunciation, without being itself pronounced, as it normally is. For example, {{angle bracket|an}} gives the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u00e3n]}} whereas {{angle bracket|a\u00f1}} gives {{IPA|[\u00e3]}}.\n\n====Palatal n====\n{{main|\u00d1}}\nThe tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|\u00f1}}, {{angle bracket|\u00d1}}) developed from the digraph {{angle bracket|nn}} in Spanish. In this language, {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} is considered a separate letter called ''[[\u00d1|e\u00f1e]]'' ({{IPA-es|\u02c8e\u0272e|IPA}}), rather than a letter-diacritic combination; it is placed in Spanish dictionaries between the letters {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|o}}. In Spanish, the word ''tilde'' actually refers to diacritics in general, e.g. the acute accent in ''Jos\u00e9'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Ortograf\u00eda de la lengua espa\u00f1ola |year=2010 |publisher=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-670-3426-4 |page=279 }}</ref> while the diacritic in {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} is called \"virgulilla\" ({{IPA-es|bir\u0263u\u02c8li\u029da|IPA}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=virgulilla |title=Lema en la RAE |publisher=[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] |access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref> Current languages in which the tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|\u00f1}}) is used for the [[palatal nasal]] consonant {{IPA|/\u0272/}} include:\n{{div col|colwidth=8em}}\n* [[Asturian language|Asturian]]\n* [[Basque language|Basque]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Filipino language|Filipino]]\n* [[Galician language|Galician]]\n* [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]\n* [[I\u00f1upiaq]]\n* [[Mapudungun]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n* [[Tetum language|Tetum]]\n* [[Aymara language|Aymara]]\n* [[Wolof language|Wolof]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Tone====\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], a tilde over a vowel represents a creaky rising [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (''ng\u00e3'').\n\n====International Phonetic Alphabet====\nIn [[phonetics]], a tilde is used as a [[IPA diacritics|diacritic that is placed]] above a letter, below it or [[superimpose]]d onto the middle of it:\n\n* A tilde above a letter indicates [[nasalization]], e.g. {{IPA|[\u00e3], [\u1e7d]}}.\n* A tilde superimposed onto the middle of a letter indicates [[velarization]] or [[pharyngealization]], e.g. {{IPA|[\u026b], [z\u0334]}}. If no precomposed [[Unicode]] character exists, the Unicode character {{unichar|0334|COMBINING TILDE OVERLAY|cwith=\u25cc}} can be used to generate one.\n* A tilde below a letter indicates [[Creaky voice|laryngealisation]], e.g. {{IPA|[d\u0330]}}. If no precomposed Unicode character exists, the Unicode character {{unichar|0330|COMBINING TILDE BELOW|cwith=\u25cc}} can be used to generate one.\n\n====Letter extension====\nIn [[Estonian language|Estonian]], the symbol {{angle bracket|\u00f5}} stands for the [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]], and it is considered an independent letter.\n\n====Other uses====\nSome languages and alphabets use the tilde for other purposes:\n* [[Arabic script]]: A symbol resembling the tilde ({{unichar|0653|ARABIC MADDAH ABOVE|cwith=\u0640|nlink=Arabic diacritics#Maddah}}) is used over the letter {{angle bracket|\u0627}} ({{IPA|/a/}}) to become <big>{{angle bracket|[[\u0622]]}}</big>, denoting a long {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} sound ({{IPA|[\u0294\u00e6\u02d0]}}).\n* [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]: The tilded {{angle bracket|[[G\u0303]]}} (note that {{angle bracket|G/g}} with tilde is not available as a precomposed glyph in [[Unicode]]) stands for the [[velar nasal]] consonant.  Also, the tilded {{angle bracket|y}} ({{angle bracket|\u1ef8}}) stands for the nasalized upper central rounded vowel {{IPA|[\u0268\u0303]}}.  [[Munduruku language|Munduruku]], Parintint\u00edn, and two older spellings of Filipino words also use {{angle bracket|g\u0303}}. \n* [[Syriac script]]: A tilde (~) under the letter ''[[Kaph]]'' represents a {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}} sound, transliterated as ''ch'' or ''\u010d''.<ref>[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888).

English),{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} a tilde-like wavy dash may be used as [[punctuation]] (instead of an unspaced [[hyphen]], [[en dash]] or [[em dash]]) between two [[number]]s, to indicate a [[Interval (mathematics)|range]] rather than [[subtraction]] or a hyphenated number (such as a part number or model number). For example, \"12~15\" means \"12 to 15\", \"~3\" means \"up to three\", and \"100~\" means \"100 and greater\". [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] and other [[East Asian languages]] almost always use this convention, but it is often done for clarity in some other languages as well. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] uses the wavy dash and full-width em dash interchangeably for this purpose. In English, the tilde is often used to express ranges and model numbers in [[electronics]], but rarely in formal grammar or in type-set documents, as a wavy dash preceding a number sometimes represents an approximation (see below).\n\n==== Approximation ====\n{{see also|Approximation}}\nBefore a number the tilde can mean 'approximately;  '~42' means 'approximately 42'.<ref>\n{{Cite web  | url = http://www.linfo.org/tilde.html | title = Tilde Definition | website=linfo.org | publisher = The Linux Information Project  | date = June 24, 2005 | accessdate= 27 January 2020}}</ref> When used with [[currency symbol]]s that precede the number (national conventions differ), the tilde precedes the symbol, thus for example '~$10' means 'about ten dollars'.<ref> {{Cite web\n|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/116048/using-a-tilde-with-currency |title=Using a tilde with currency}}</ref>\n\nThe symbols <big>\u2248</big> (almost equal to) and <big>\u2245</big> (approximately equal to) are among the other [[approximation#Unicode|symbols used to express approximation]].\n\n====Japanese====\n{{further|Japanese punctuation#Wave dash}}\n\nThe {{Nihongo|'''wave dash'''|\u6ce2\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|nami dasshu}} is used for various purposes in Japanese, including to denote ranges of numbers, in place of dashes or brackets, and to indicate origin. The wave dash is also used to separate a title and a subtitle in the same line, as a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used in English.\n\nWhen used in conversations via email or instant messenger it may be used as a [[sarcasm mark]].\n\nThe sign is used as a replacement for the [[Ch\u014donpu|chouon]], katakana character, in Japanese, extending the final syllable.\n\n=====Unicode and Shift JIS encoding of wave dash=====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Wave Dash.svg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = Correct JIS wave dash.\n| caption1 = Correct JIS wave dash.\n| image2 = Wave Dash2.svg\n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = Previous Unicode wave dash (incorrect).\n| caption2 = Previous Unicode wave dash (incorrect).\n| footer = \n}} \nIn practice the {{Nihongo|'''full-width tilde'''|\u5168\u89d2\u30c1\u30eb\u30c0|zenkaku chiruda}}, Unicode U+FF5E, is often used instead of the {{Nihongo|'''wave dash'''|\u6ce2\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|nami dasshu}}, Unicode U+301C, because the [[Shift JIS]] code for the wave dash, 0x8160, which is supposed to be mapped to U+301C,<ref>{{Citation | chapter-url = http://x0213.org/codetable/sjis-0213-2004-std.txt | title = JIS X 0213:2004 | chapter = Appendix 1: Shift_JIS-2004 vs Unicode mapping table | publisher = X 0213}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/JIS/SHIFTJIS.TXT | title = Shift-JIS to Unicode | publisher = Unicode}}.</ref> is instead mapped to U+FF5E<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/932/932_81.htm |title=Windows 932_81 |publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> in [[code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)|Windows code page 932]] ([[Microsoft]]'s [[code page]] for Japanese), a widely used extension of Shift JIS.\n\nThis avoided a shape definition error in the Unicode code charts: the wave dash reference glyph in JIS / Shift JIS<ref>{{cite web |place=[[Japan|JP]] |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/087.pdf |title=ISO-IR-087: Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange |publisher=Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (IPSJ/ITSCJ) }}</ref><ref name=\"jisplane1\">{{cite web| place = [[Japan|JP]] | url = http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/233.pdf | title = ISO-IR-233: Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange, Plane 1 | publisher = Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (IPSJ/ITSCJ) }}</ref> matches the Unicode reference glyph for '''U+FF5E''',<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFF00.pdf | title = Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms | type = chart | publisher = Unicode}}.</ref> while the reference glyph for '''U+301C'''<ref>{{Citation | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130827100409if_/http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3000.pdf | title = CJK Symbols and Punctuation (Unicode 6.2) | type = chart | publisher = Unicode}}.</ref> was reflected, incorrectly,<ref name=\"errata8\">{{citation|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/erratafixed.html|title=Errata Fixed in Unicode 8.0.0|publisher=Unicode}}</ref> when Unicode imported the JIS wave dash.

Modern use often replaces the tilde with the negation symbol (\u00ac) for this purpose, to avoid confusion with [[equivalence relation]]s.\n\n====As a relational operator====\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the tilde operator (Unicode U+223C), sometimes called \"twiddle\", is often used to denote an [[equivalence relation]] between two objects.  Thus \"{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}\" means \"{{mvar|x}} is [[equivalence relation|equivalent]] to {{mvar|y}}\". It is a weaker statement than stating that {{mvar|x}} [[equality (mathematics)|equals]] {{mvar|y}}. The expression \"{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar |y}}}}\" is sometimes read aloud as \"{{mvar|x}} twiddles {{mvar|y}}\", perhaps as an analogue to the verbal expression of \"{{math |1={{mvar |x}} = {{mvar|y}}}}\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Derbyshire | first = J | title = Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics | place = New York | publisher = Penguin | year = 2004 | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html}}.</ref>\n\nThe tilde can indicate approximate equality in a variety of ways.  It can be used to denote the [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic equality]] of two functions. For example, {{math|{{mvar|f}}\u200a({{mvar|x}}) ~ {{mvar |g}}({{mvar |x}})}} means that <math>\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1</math>.<ref name=wolfram_tilde />\n\nA tilde is also used to indicate \"[[Approximation|approximately]] equal to\" (e.g. 1.902 ~= 2).  This usage probably developed as a typed alternative to the [[:Image:Libra.svg|libra symbol]] used for the same purpose in written mathematics, which is an equal sign with the upper bar replaced by a bar with an upward hump, bump, or loop in the middle (\ufe0d\ufe0d\u264e&#xFE0E;) or, sometimes, a tilde (\u2243).  The symbol \"\u2248\" is also used for this purpose.\n\nIn [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], a tilde can be used between two expressions (e.g. {{math|{{mvar|h}} ~ 10<sup>\u221234</sup> J s}}) to state that the two are of the same [[order of magnitude]].<ref name=wolfram_tilde />\n\nIn [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], the tilde means \"is distributed as\";<ref name = wolfram_tilde /> see [[random variable]].\n\nA tilde can also be used to represent geometric [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] (e.g. {{math |\u2206{{mvar |ABC}} ~ \u2206{{mvar|DEF}}}}, meaning [[triangle]] {{mvar|ABC}} is similar to {{mvar|DEF}}). A triple tilde ('''\u224b''') is often used to show [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]], an equivalence relation in geometry.\n\n====As an accent====\n\nThe symbol \"<math>\\tilde{f}</math>\" is pronounced as \"eff tilde\" or, informally, as \"eff twiddle\" or, in American English, \"eff wiggle\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html\n| title = Tilde\n| publisher = Wolfram Research\n| access-date = June 4, 2018\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SY5fZIK63NMC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=schlange+twiddle |title=Proceedings of the Analysis Conference, Singapore 1986 |publisher=Elsevier | year = 1988 | first1 =Stephen TL | last1 = Choy | first2 =Judith Packer | last2 = Jesudason | first3 = Peng Yee | last3 = Lee |accessdate=11 November 2011|isbn=9780080872612 }}</ref>  This can be used to denote the [[Fourier transform]] of ''f'', or a [[lift (mathematics)|lift]] of ''f'', and can have a variety of other meanings depending on the context.\n\nA tilde placed below a letter in mathematics can represent a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (e.g. <math>(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n) = \\underset{^\\sim}{\\mathbf x}</math>).\n\nIn [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the [[median]] of that variable; thus <math>\\tilde{\\mathbf y}</math> would indicate the median of the variable <math>\\mathbf y</math>. A tilde over the letter n (<math>\\tilde{n}</math>) is sometimes used to indicate the [[harmonic mean]].\n\nIn machine learning, a tilde may represent a candidate value for a cell state in [[Gated recurrent unit|GRUs]] or [[LSTM]] units. (e.g. c\u0303)\n\n===Physics===\nOften in physics, one can consider an equilibrium solution to an equation, and then a perturbation to that equilibrium.  For the variables in the original equation (for instance <math>X</math>) a substitution <math>X\\to x+\\tilde{x}</math> can be made, where <math>x</math> is the equilibrium part and <math>\\tilde{x}</math> is the perturbed part.\n\nA tilde is also used in [[particle physics]] to denote the hypothetical [[supersymmetric]] partner.  For example, an [[electron]] is referred to by the letter ''e'', and its [[superpartner]] the [[selectron (particle)|selectron]] is written ''\u1ebd''.\n\n===Economics===\nFor relations involving preference, [[economist]]s sometimes use the tilde to represent [[Preference (economics)#Notation|indifference]] between two or more bundles of goods.  For example, to say that a consumer is indifferent between bundles ''x'' and ''y'', an economist would write ''x'' ~ ''y''.\n\n===Electronics===\nIt can approximate the sine wave symbol (\u223f, [[Unicode|U+]]223F), which is used in [[electronics]] to indicate [[alternating current]], in place of +, \u2212, or \u2393 for [[direct current]].\n\n===Linguistics===\nThe tilde may indicate alternating [[allomorph]]s or [[Morphophonology|morphological alternation]], as in {{IPA|//\u02c8ni\u02d0~\u025bl+t//}} for ''kneel~knelt'' (the plus sign '+' indicates a morpheme boundary).<ref>Collinge (2002) ''An Encyclopedia of Language'', \u00a74.2.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Hayes | first=Bruce | authorlink=Bruce Hayes (linguist) | title=Introductory Phonology | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=2011 | isbn=9781444360134 | pages=87\u201388 }}</ref>\n\n===Computing===\n\n==== Directories and URLs ====\nOn [[Unix]]-like [[operating system]]s (including [[AIX]], [[BSD]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]), tilde normally indicates the current user's [[home directory]]. For example, if the current user's home directory is {{mono|/home/user}}, then the command {{mono|cd ~}} is equivalent to {{mono|cd /home/user}}, {{mono|cd $HOME}}, or {{mono|cd}}. This convention derives from the [[Lear-Siegler]] [[ADM-3A]] terminal in common use during the 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word \"Home\" (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}<!-- may be true, but we need a source for \"derives\" --> When prepended to a particular username, the tilde indicates that user's home directory (e.g., {{mono|~janedoe}} for the home directory of user {{mono|janedoe}}, such as {{mono|/home/janedoe}}).<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Tilde expansion | publisher = The GNU project | title = C Library Manual | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = https://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html}}.</ref>\n\nUsed in [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] on the [[World Wide Web]], it often denotes a personal website on a [[Unix]]-based server. For example, {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/~johndoe/</nowiki>}} might be the personal web site of John Doe. This mimics the Unix shell usage of the tilde.  However, when accessed from the web, file access is usually directed to a [[subdirectory]] in the user's home directory, such as {{mono|/home/''username''/public_html}} or {{mono|/home/''username''/www}}.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Module mod_userdir | publisher = The Apache foundation | title = HTTP Server Documentation | edition = version 2.0 | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_userdir.html}}.</ref>\n\nIn URLs, the characters {{mono|%7E}} (or {{mono|%7e}}) may substitute for tilde if an input device lacks a tilde key.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-12 | title = RFC 3986 | publisher = IETF}}.</ref> Thus, {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/~johndoe/</nowiki>}} and {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/%7Ejohndoe/</nowiki>}} will behave in the same manner.\n\n==== Computer languages ====\nThe tilde is used in the [[AWK]] [[programming language]] as part of the pattern match operators for [[regular expression]]s:\n*<code>''variable'' ~ /''regex''/</code> returns true if the variable is matched.\n*<code>''variable'' !~ /''regex''/</code> returns false if the variable is matched.\n\nA variant of this, with the plain tilde replaced with <code>=~</code>, was adopted in [[Perl]], and this semi-standardization has led to the use of these operators in other programming languages, such as [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] or the [[SQL]] variant of the database [[PostgreSQL]].\n\nIn [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[MATLAB]], tilde represents the monadic logical function NOT, and in APL it additionally represents the dyadic [[multiset]] function ''without'' ([[Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement|set difference]]).\n\nIn the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming languages, the tilde character is used as [[bitwise NOT]] [[Operators in C and C++|operator]], following the notation in logic (an <code>!</code> causes a logical NOT, instead).  In C++ and C#, the tilde is also used as the first character in a [[Class (computer science)|class]]'s [[method (computer science)|method]] name (where the rest of the name must be the same name as the class) to indicate a [[destructor (computer science)|destructor]] \u2013 a special method which is called at the end of the [[Object lifetime|object's life]]. The [[MySQL|MySQL database]] also use tilde as bitwise invert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/bit-functions.html#operator_bitwise-invert|title=MySQL :: Reference Manual :: Bit Functions and Operators|last=|first=|date=|website=dev.mysql.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> \n\nIn ASP.NET application tilde ('~') is used as a shortcut to the root of the application's virtual directory.\n\nIn the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] stylesheet language, the tilde is used for the indirect adjacent combinator as part of a selector.\n\nIn the [[D programming language]], the tilde is used as an [[Array data structure|array]] [[concatenation]] operator, as well as to indicate an object destructor and bitwise not operator.  Tilde operator can be overloaded for user types, and binary tilde operator is mostly used to merging two objects, or adding some objects to set of objects. It was introduced because plus operator can have different meaning in many situations. For example, what to do with \"120\" + \"14\" ? Is this a string \"134\" (addition of two numbers), or \"12014\" (concatenation of strings) or something else? D disallows + operator for arrays (and strings), and provides separate operator for concatenation (similarly [[PHP]] programming language solved this problem by using dot operator for concatenation, and + for number addition, which will also work on strings containing numbers).\n\nIn [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], the tilde is used for object comparison. If ''a'' and ''b'' denote objects, the boolean expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' has value true if and only if these objects are equal, as defined by the applicable version of the library routine ''is_equal'', which by default denotes field-by-field object equality but can be redefined in any class to support a specific notion of equality. If ''a'' and ''b'' are references, the object equality expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is to be contrasted with ''a'' = ''b'' which denotes reference equality. Unlike the call ''a''.''is_equal'' (''b''), the expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is [[type safety|type-safe]] even in the presence of [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]].\n\nIn the [[Groovy (programming language)|Apache Groovy programming language]] the tilde character is used as an operator mapped to the bitwiseNegate() method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operator%20Overloading|title=The Groovy programming language - Operators|publisher=}}</ref> Given a String the method will produce a java.util.regex.Pattern.

A stand-alone tilde can be obtained by using <code>\\textasciitilde</code> or <code>\\string~</code>.\nIn \"math mode\" a tilde diacritic can be written as, e.g., <code>\\tilde{x}</code>. For a wider tilde <code>\\widetilde</code> can be used. The <code>\\sim</code> command produce a tilde-like binary relation symbol that is often used in mathematical expressions, and the double-tilde [[\u2248]] is obtained with <code>\\approx</code>. The <code>url</code> package also supports entering tildes directly, e.g., <code><nowiki>\\url{http://server/~name}</nowiki></code>.\nIn both text and math mode, a tilde on its own (<code>~</code>) renders a white space with no line breaking.\n\nIn [[MediaWiki]] [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], four tildes are used as a shortcut for a user's signature.\n\nIn [[Common Lisp]], the tilde is used as the prefix for format specifiers in format strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm |title=CLHS: Section 22.3 |publisher=Lispworks.com |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref>\nIn [[Max/MSP]], a tilde is used to denote objects that process at the computer's sampling rate, i.e. mainly those that deal with sound.\n\nIn [[Standard ML]], the tilde is used as the prefix for negative numbers and as the unary negation operator.\n\nIn [[OCaml]], the tilde is used to specify the label for a labeled parameter.\n\nIn Microsoft's SQL Server [[Transact-SQL|Transact-SQL (T-SQL)]] language, the tilde is a unary [[Bitwise NOT#NOT|Bitwise NOT]] operator.\n\nIn [[JavaScript]], the tilde is used as a unary [[Bitwise operation#NOT|bitwise complement]] (or bitwise negation) operation (<code>~number</code>). Because JavaScript internally uses floats and the bitwise complement only works on integers, numbers are stripped of their decimal part before applying the operation. This has also given rise to using '''two tildes''' <code>~~number</code> as a short syntax for a cast to integer (numbers are stripped of their decimal part and changed into their complement, and then back. The net result is thus only the removal of the decimal part). For positive numbers, this is equivalent to the mathematical ''[[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]]'' function.\n\nIn [[Object REXX]], the twiddle is used as a \"message send\" symbol. For example, <code>Employee.name~lower()</code> would cause the <code>lower()</code> method to act on the object <code>Employee</code>'s <code>name</code> attribute, returning the result of the operation. <code>~~</code> returns the object that received the method rather than the result produced. Thus it can be used when the result need not be returned or when cascading methods are to be used. <code>team~~insert(\"Jane\")~~insert(\"Joe\")~~insert(\"Steve\")</code> would send multiple concurrent <code>insert</code> messages, thus invoking the <code>insert</code> method three consecutive times on the <code>team</code> object.\n\n==== Backup filenames ====\nThe dominant [[Unix]] convention for naming backup copies of files is appending a tilde to the original file name.\nIt originated with the [[Emacs]] text editor<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names Emacs Manual]</ref> and was adopted by many other editors and some command-line tools.\n\nEmacs also introduced an elaborate numbered backup scheme, with files named {{mono|filename.~1~}}, {{mono|filename.~2~}} and so on.  It didn't catch on, as the rise of [[version control]] software eliminates the need for this usage.\n\n==== Microsoft filenames ====\nThe tilde was part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[filename mangling]] scheme when it extended the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system standard to support long filenames for [[Microsoft Windows]].  Programs written prior to this development could only access filenames in the so-called [[8.3 filename|8.3 format]]\u2014the filenames consisted of a maximum of eight characters from a restricted character set (e.g. no spaces), followed by a period, followed by three more characters.  In order to permit these legacy programs to access files in the FAT file system, each file had to be given two names\u2014one long, more descriptive one, and one that conformed to the 8.3 format.  This was accomplished with a name-mangling scheme in which the first six characters of the filename are followed by a tilde and a digit.  For example, \"{{mono|Program Files}}\" might become \"{{mono|PROGRA~1}}\".\n\nThe tilde symbol is also often used to prefix hidden temporary files that are created when a document is opened in Windows. For example, when a document \"Document1.doc\" is opened in Word, a file called \"~$cument1.doc\" is created in the same directory. This file contains information about which user has the file open, to prevent multiple users from attempting to change a document at the same time.\n\n==== Other uses ====\n[[Computer programmers]] use the tilde in various ways and sometimes call the symbol (as opposed to the diacritic) a '''squiggle''', '''squiggly''', or '''twiddle'''.  According to the [[Jargon File]], other synonyms sometimes used in programming include '''not''', '''approx''', '''wiggle''', '''enyay''' (after ''[[\u00f1|e\u00f1e]]'') and (humorously) '''sqiggle''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|k|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259l}}.  It is used in many languages as a binary inversion operator, swapping a number's binary 1's and 0's for example ~10 (binary ~1010) is equal to 5 (binary 0101).\n\nIn [[Raku (programming language)|Raku]], \"<nowiki>~~</nowiki>\" is used instead of \"[[=~]]\".\n\n===Juggling notation===\nIn the [[juggling notation]] system Beatmap, tilde can be added to either \"hand\" in a pair of fields to say \"cross the arms with this hand on top\".

This distinguishes it from the ''small tilde''&nbsp;( \u02dc ) introduced with [[Windows-1252]], which is always raised. But in some [[monospace font]]s, especially used in [[text user interface]]s, [[ASCII]] tilde character is raised too. This apparently is a legacy of [[typewriter]]s, where pairs of similar spacing and combining characters relied on one glyph. Even in [[line printer]]s' age character repertoires were often not large enough to distinguish between plain tilde, small tilde and combining tilde. Overprinting of a letter by the tilde was a working method of [[combining character|combining a letter]].\n\n==Keyboards==\nWhere a tilde is on the keyboard depends on the computer's language settings according to the following chart. On many keyboards it is primarily available through a [[dead key]] that makes it possible to produce a variety of [[precomposed character]]s with the diacritic.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In that case, a single tilde can typically be inserted with the dead key followed by the space bar, or alternatively by striking the dead key twice in a row.\n\nTo insert a tilde with the dead key, it is often necessary to simultaneously hold down the [[Alt Gr]] key. With a [[Macintosh]] either of the Alt/[[Option key|Option]] keys function similarly.\n\nIn the US and European [[Windows]] systems, the [[Alt code]] for a single tilde is <code>126</code>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Keyboard!!Insert a single tilde (~)!!Insert a precomposed character with tilde (e.g. \u00e3)\n|-\n|Arabic ([[Saudi Arabia]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`\u0630\u0651}}\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n|[[Croatian language|Croatian]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|-\n|[[Czech language|Czech]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|\n|-\n|[[Danish language|Danish]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|<nowiki>=</nowiki>}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift|'}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}</span>\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|<nowiki>=</nowiki>}} followed by the relevant letter, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift|'}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[English language|English]] ([[Australia]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|\n|-\n|English ([[Canada]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|\n|-\n|English ([[United Kingdom|UK]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|<nowiki>#</nowiki>}}\n|{{keypress|AltGr|#}} followed by the relevant letter ([[QWERTY#United Kingdom (Extended) Layout|UK-extended layout]], [[Chrome OS]])\n|-\n|English ([[United States|US]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|{{keypress|Ctrl|~}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00f0}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00f0}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Finnish language|Finnish]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}}{{keypress|\u00a8}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[French language|French]] ([[Canada]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}}{{keypress|\u00e7}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|French ([[France]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}}{{keypress|\u00e9}} <br />{{keypress|Option|n}} (on Mac OS X)\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|French ([[Switzerland]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}}{{keypress|^}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[B\u00e9po]] (French Dvorak)\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|N}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|K}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|N}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[German language|German]] ([[Germany]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|+}}\n|\n|-\n|German ([[Switzerland]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}}{{keypress|^}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n| [[Hebrew]] ([[Israel]])\n| {{keypress|Shift|~}}\n| {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|~}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Hindi]] ([[India]])\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift}}+ the key to the left of {{keypress|1}}</span>\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|-\n|[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|'}} (the same key as {{keypress|?}})\n|-\n|[[Italian language|Italian]]\n|{{keypress|Option|5}} (on Mac OS X)\n{{Keypress|Alt Gr|\u00ec}} (on Linux)\n\n{{Keypress|Alt|1}}{{Keypress|2}}{{Keypress|6}} (on Windows)\n\n|-\n|[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}}{{keypress|\u00a8}}.\n\nOn Mac: {{keypress|Ctrl|Option|\u00a8}}, or {{keypress|Option|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}.\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter.\n\nOn Mac: {{keypress|Option|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter.\n|-\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Shift|`}}{{keypress|`}}\n|The dead key is not generally used for inserting characters with tilde;

The name of the character came into English from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which in turn came from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:titulus|titulus]]'', meaning \"title\" or \"superscription\".<ref name=ah/>\n\nThe reason for the name was that it was originally written over an omitted letter (or several letters) as a [[scribal abbreviation]] (or \"mark of suspension\" / \"mark of contraction\",<ref>Martin, Charles Trice (1910). The record interpreter : a collection of abbreviations, Latin words and names used in English historical manuscripts and records (2nd ed.). London, preface, p.5[https://archive.org/details/recordinterprete00martuoft/page/n9/mode/2up]</ref>) shown as a straight line when used with capitals. Thus the commonly used words ''[[Anno Domini]]'' were frequently abbreviated to ''A<sup>o</sup> D\u00f1i'', with an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the \"n\". Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe's labour and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full. \n\nThe tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a [[diacritic]] mark or a character in its own right. These are encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|0303|Combining Tilde|cwith=\u25cc}} and {{unichar|007e|Tilde|note=as a spacing character}}, and there are [[#Similar characters|additional similar characters]] for different roles. In [[lexicography]], the latter kind of tilde and the '''[[swung dash]]''' (\u2053) are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=swung+dash&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=000000000000 | title = WordNet | type = search | edition = 3.0 | contribution = Swung dash}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Use by medieval scribes===\n[[File:Text of Exeter Domesday Book of 1086.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Text of Exeter [[Domesday Book]] of 1086]]\n\nThe text of the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, relating for example, to the [[manor of Molland]] in [[Devon]] (see image left), is highly [[Scribal abbreviation|abbreviated]] as indicated by numerous tildes.

When all [[character set]]s were pieces of metal permanently installed, and number of characters much more limited than in [[typography]], the question of which languages and markets required which characters was an important one. Any good typewriter store had a catalog of alternative keyboards that could be specified for machines ordered from the factory.\n\nAt that time, the tilde was used only in Spanish and Portuguese typewriters (keyboards). In Modern Spanish, the tilde is used only with ''\u00f1'' and ''\u00d1''. Both were conveniently assigned to a single mechanical typebar, which sacrificed a key that was felt to be less important, usually the {{frac|1|2}}\u2014{{frac|1|4}} key.\n\nPortuguese, however, uses not ''\u00f1'' but ''nh''. It uses the tilde on the vowels ''a'' and ''o''. So as not to sacrifice two of the tightly limited keys to \u00e3 \u00c3 \u00f5 \u00d5, the decision was made to make the ~ a separate \"dead\" character in which the carriage holding the paper did not move. [[Dead key]]s, which had a notch cut out to avoid hitting a mechanical linkage that triggered carriage movement, were used for characters that were intended to be combined (overstruck).\n\nOn mechanical typewriters, Spanish keyboards (the first, or one of the first, non-English keyboards) had a dead key, which contained the [[acute accent]] (\u00b4), used over any vowel, and the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] (\u00a8), used only over ''u''. It was a simple matter to create a dead key for a Portuguese keyboard (created later than the Spanish one) to be overstruck with ''a'' and ''o'' and so the ~ was born as a typographical character, which did not exist previously as a [[sort (typesetting)|type]] or [[Hot metal typesetting|hot-lead]] printing character. That was probably a product of the first and leading manufacturer of (mechanical) typewriters, [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington]].\n\n==Connection to Spanish==\n{{Main|\u00d1}}\n[[File:Logotipo del Instituto Cervantes.svg|thumbnail|left|Logo of the Instituto Cervantes]]\n[[File:Logo de CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.svg|thumbnail|right|Logo of CNN en Espa\u00f1ol]]\nAs indicated by the etymological origin of the word \"tilde\" in English, this symbol has been closely associated with the [[Spanish language]]. The connection stems from the use of the tilde above the letter \"n\" to form \"\u00f1\" in Spanish, a feature shared by only [[Tilde#Palatal n|a few other languages]], all historically connected to Spanish. This peculiarity can help non-native speakers quickly identify a text as being written in Spanish with little chance of error. In addition, most native speakers, although [[names given to the Spanish language|not all]], use the word \"espa'''\u00f1'''ol\" to refer to their language. Particularly during the 1990s, Spanish-speaking intellectuals and news outlets demonstrated support for the language and the culture by defending this letter against [[globalisation]] and [[computer]]isation trends that threatened to remove it from keyboards and other standardised products and codes.<ref>{{cite web|title=26 argumentos para seguir defendiendo la \u00d1|url=http://www.larazon.es/historico/651-26-argumentos-para-seguir-defendiendo-la-n-SLLA_RAZON_352314#.Ttt1ZN8CWth9pio|website=La Raz\u00f3n|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=11 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/internacionales/batalla-de-la-n-una-aventura-quijotesca-para-defender-el-alma-de-la-lengua-797718.html |title=Batalla de la \u00d1: Una aventura quijotesca para defender el alma de la lengua |last=AFP |date=18 November 2004 |website=Peri\u00f3dico ABC Paraguay |access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Instituto Cervantes]], founded by [[Spanish government|Spain's government]] to promote the Spanish language internationally, chose as its logo a highly stylised \u00d1 with a large tilde. The 24-hour news channel [[CNN]] in the US later adopted a similar strategy on its existing logo for the launch of its [[CNN en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish-language version]]. And similarly to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[Spain men's national basketball team]] is nicknamed ''\u00d1BA''.\n\nIn Spanish itself the word ''tilde'' is used more generally for diacritics, including the stress-marking acute accent.<ref>[http://dle.rae.es/?id=ZkHNOE8 Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola], Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola</ref>  The diacritic ''~'' is more commonly called  ''virgulilla'' or ''la tilde de la e\u00f1e'', and is not considered an accent mark in Spanish, but rather simply a part of the letter \u00f1 (much like [[tittle|the dot over the i]]).\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Common use===\nThis symbol (in US English) informally<ref name=wolfram_tilde /> means [[approximation|\"approximately\"]], \"about\", or \"around\", such as \"~30 minutes before\", meaning \"''approximately'' 30 minutes before\".<ref name=\"bymath1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.bymath.com/symbols/symbols.html | title =All Elementary Mathematics \u2013 Mathematical symbols dictionary |publisher=Bymath | accessdate =11 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.aspx|title=Character design standards - Maths|publisher=}}</ref> It can mean \"similar to\",<ref name=\"htmlhelp1\">{{cite web| first =Liam | last = Quinn |url=http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html |title=HTML 4.0 Entities for Symbols and Greek Letters |publisher=HTML help |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> including \"of the same [[order of magnitude]] as\",<ref name=wolfram_tilde>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html | publisher = Wolfram/MathWorld | title = Tilde |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> such as: \"{{math |{{mvar |x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}\" meaning that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are of the same order of magnitude.

In the computing field, especially in [[Unix]] based systems, the tilde indicates the user's home directory.\n\n===Diacritical use===\nIn some languages, the tilde is used as a [[diacritic]]al mark (''' \u02dc ''') placed over a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] to indicate a change in pronunciation, such as [[nasalization]].\n\n====Pitch====\nThe tilde was first used in the [[Greek diacritics|polytonic orthography]] of [[Ancient Greek]], as a variant of the [[circumflex]], representing a rise in [[pitch accent|pitch]] followed by a return to standard pitch.\n\n====Abbreviation====\n[[File:Hic Fabricatur Naves.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Carta marina]]'' showing Finnish economy, with the captions ''Hic fabricantur naves'' and ''Hic fabricantur [[Bombard (weapon)|bombarde]]'' abbreviated]]\nLater, it was used to make [[scribal abbreviation|abbreviations]] in medieval [[Latin language|Latin]] documents.  When an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} followed a vowel, it was often omitted, and a tilde (i.e., a small {{angle bracket|n}}) was placed over the preceding vowel to indicate the missing letter; this is the origin of the use of tilde to indicate nasalization  (compare [[Umlaut (diacritic)#Umlaut|the development of the umlaut]] as an abbreviation of {{angle bracket|e}}.)  The practice of using the tilde over a vowel to indicate omission of an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} continued in printed books in [[French language|French]] as a means of reducing text length until the 17th century. It was also used in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nThe tilde was also used occasionally to make other abbreviations, such as over the letter {{angle bracket|q}} (\"[[wikt:q\u0303|q\u0303]]\") to signify the word ''que'' (\"that\").\n\n====Nasalization====\nIt is also as a small {{angle bracket|n}} that the tilde originated when written above other letters, marking a [[Latin language|Latin]] {{angle bracket|n}} which had been [[elision|elided]] in old Galician-Portuguese.  In modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] it indicates [[nasalization]] of the base vowel: ''m\u00e3o'' \"hand\", from Lat. ''manu-''; ''raz\u00f5es'' \"reasons\", from Lat. ''rationes''.  This usage has been adopted in the orthographies of several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages of South America]], such as [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], as well as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and many other phonetic alphabets. For example, {{IPA|[lj\u0254\u0303]}} is the IPA transcription of the pronunciation of the French place-name ''[[Lyon]]''.\n\nIn [[Breton language|Breton]], the symbol {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} after a vowel means that the letter {{angle bracket|n}} serves only to give the vowel a nasalised pronunciation, without being itself pronounced, as it normally is. For example, {{angle bracket|an}} gives the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u00e3n]}} whereas {{angle bracket|a\u00f1}} gives {{IPA|[\u00e3]}}.\n\n====Palatal n====\n{{main|\u00d1}}\nThe tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|\u00f1}}, {{angle bracket|\u00d1}}) developed from the digraph {{angle bracket|nn}} in Spanish. In this language, {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} is considered a separate letter called ''[[\u00d1|e\u00f1e]]'' ({{IPA-es|\u02c8e\u0272e|IPA}}), rather than a letter-diacritic combination; it is placed in Spanish dictionaries between the letters {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|o}}. In Spanish the word ''tilde'' actually refers to diacritics in general, e.g. the acute accent in ''Jos\u00e9'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Ortograf\u00eda de la lengua espa\u00f1ola |year=2010 |publisher=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-670-3426-4 |page=279 }}</ref> while the diacritic in {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} is called \"virgulilla\" ({{IPA-es|bir\u0263u\u02c8li\u029da|IPA}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=virgulilla |title=Lema en la RAE |publisher=[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] |access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref> Current languages in which the tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|\u00f1}}) is used for the [[palatal nasal]] consonant {{IPA|/\u0272/}} include:\n{{div col|colwidth=8em}}\n* [[Asturian language|Asturian]]\n* [[Basque language|Basque]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Filipino language|Filipino]]\n* [[Galician language|Galician]]\n* [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]\n* [[I\u00f1upiaq]]\n* [[Mapudungun]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n* [[Tetum language|Tetum]]\n* [[Aymara language|Aymara]]\n* [[Wolof language|Wolof]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Tone====\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], a tilde over a vowel represents a creaky rising [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (''ng\u00e3'').\n\n====International Phonetic Alphabet====\nIn [[phonetics]], a tilde is used as a [[IPA diacritics|diacritic that is placed]] above a letter, below it or [[superimpose]]d onto the middle of it:\n\n* A tilde above a letter indicates [[nasalization]], e.g. {{IPA|[\u00e3], [\u1e7d]}}.\n* A tilde superimposed onto the middle of a letter indicates [[velarization]] or [[pharyngealization]], e.g. {{IPA|[\u026b], [z\u0334]}}. If no precomposed [[Unicode]] character exists, the Unicode character {{unichar|0334|COMBINING TILDE OVERLAY|cwith=\u25cc}} can be used to generate one.\n* A tilde below a letter indicates [[Creaky voice|laryngealisation]], e.g. {{IPA|[d\u0330]}}.

Also, the tilded {{angle bracket|y}} ({{angle bracket|\u1ef8}}) stands for the nasalized upper central rounded vowel {{IPA|[\u0268\u0303]}}.  [[Munduruku language|Munduruku]], Parintint\u00edn, and two older spellings of Filipino words also use {{angle bracket|g\u0303}}. \n* [[Syriac script]]: A tilde (~) under the letter ''[[Kaph]]'' represents a {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}} sound, transliterated as ''ch'' or ''\u010d''.<ref>[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888).

English),{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} a tilde-like wavy dash may be used as [[punctuation]] (instead of an unspaced [[hyphen]], [[en dash]] or [[em dash]]) between two [[number]]s, to indicate a [[Interval (mathematics)|range]] rather than [[subtraction]] or a hyphenated number (such as a part number or model number). For example, \"12~15\" means \"12 to 15\", \"~3\" means \"up to three\", and \"100~\" means \"100 and greater\". [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] and other [[East Asian languages]] almost always use this convention, but it is often done for clarity in some other languages as well. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] uses the wavy dash and full-width em dash interchangeably for this purpose. In English, the tilde is often used to express ranges and model numbers in [[electronics]], but rarely in formal grammar or in type-set documents, as a wavy dash preceding a number sometimes represents an approximation (see below).\n\n==== Approximation ====\n{{see also|Approximation}}\nBefore a number the tilde can mean 'approximately;  '~42' means 'approximately 42'.<ref>\n{{Cite web  | url = http://www.linfo.org/tilde.html | title = Tilde Definition | website=linfo.org | publisher = The Linux Information Project  | date = June 24, 2005 | accessdate= 27 January 2020}}</ref> When used with [[currency symbol]]s that precede the number (national conventions differ), the tilde precedes the symbol, thus for example '~$10' means 'about ten dollars'.<ref> {{Cite web\n|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/116048/using-a-tilde-with-currency |title=Using a tilde with currency}}</ref>\n\nThe symbols <big>\u2248</big> (almost equal to) and <big>\u2245</big> (approximately equal to) are among the other [[approximation#Unicode|symbols used to express approximation]].\n\n====Japanese====\n{{further|Japanese punctuation#Wave dash}}\n\nThe {{Nihongo|'''wave dash'''|\u6ce2\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|nami dasshu}} is used for various purposes in Japanese, including to denote ranges of numbers, in place of dashes or brackets, and to indicate origin.

Modern use often replaces the tilde with the negation symbol (\u00ac) for this purpose, to avoid confusion with [[equivalence relation]]s.\n\n====As a relational operator====\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the tilde operator (Unicode U+223C), sometimes called \"twiddle\", is often used to denote an [[equivalence relation]] between two objects.  Thus \"{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}\" means \"{{mvar|x}} is [[equivalence relation|equivalent]] to {{mvar|y}}\". It is a weaker statement than stating that {{mvar|x}} [[equality (mathematics)|equals]] {{mvar|y}}. The expression \"{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar |y}}}}\" is sometimes read aloud as \"{{mvar|x}} twiddles {{mvar|y}}\", perhaps as an analogue to the verbal expression of \"{{math |1={{mvar |x}} = {{mvar|y}}}}\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Derbyshire | first = J | title = Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics | place = New York | publisher = Penguin | year = 2004 | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html}}.</ref>\n\nThe tilde can indicate approximate equality in a variety of ways.  It can be used to denote the [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic equality]] of two functions. For example, {{math|{{mvar|f}}\u200a({{mvar|x}}) ~ {{mvar |g}}({{mvar |x}})}} means that <math>\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1</math>.<ref name=wolfram_tilde />\n\nA tilde is also used to indicate \"[[Approximation|approximately]] equal to\" (e.g. 1.902 ~= 2).  This usage probably developed as a typed alternative to the [[:Image:Libra.svg|libra symbol]] used for the same purpose in written mathematics, which is an equal sign with the upper bar replaced by a bar with an upward hump, bump, or loop in the middle (\ufe0d\ufe0d\u264e&#xFE0E;) or, sometimes, a tilde (\u2243).  The symbol \"\u2248\" is also used for this purpose.\n\nIn [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], a tilde can be used between two expressions (e.g. {{math|{{mvar|h}} ~ 10<sup>\u221234</sup> J s}}) to state that the two are of the same [[order of magnitude]].<ref name=wolfram_tilde />\n\nIn [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], the tilde means \"is distributed as\";<ref name = wolfram_tilde /> see [[random variable]].\n\nA tilde can also be used to represent geometric [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] (e.g. {{math |\u2206{{mvar |ABC}} ~ \u2206{{mvar|DEF}}}}, meaning [[triangle]] {{mvar|ABC}} is similar to {{mvar|DEF}}). A triple tilde ('''\u224b''') is often used to show [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]], an equivalence relation in geometry.\n\n====As an accent====\n\nThe symbol \"<math>\\tilde{f}</math>\" is pronounced as \"eff tilde\" or, informally, as \"eff twiddle\" or, in American English, \"eff wiggle\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html\n| title = Tilde\n| publisher = Wolfram Research\n| access-date = June 4, 2018\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SY5fZIK63NMC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=schlange+twiddle |title=Proceedings of the Analysis Conference, Singapore 1986 |publisher=Elsevier | year = 1988 | first1 =Stephen TL | last1 = Choy | first2 =Judith Packer | last2 = Jesudason | first3 = Peng Yee | last3 = Lee |accessdate=11 November 2011|isbn=9780080872612 }}</ref>  This can be used to denote the [[Fourier transform]] of ''f'', or a [[lift (mathematics)|lift]] of ''f'', and can have a variety of other meanings depending on the context.\n\nA tilde placed below a letter in mathematics can represent a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (e.g. <math>(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n) = \\underset{^\\sim}{\\mathbf x}</math>).\n\nIn [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the [[median]] of that variable; thus <math>\\tilde{\\mathbf y}</math> would indicate the median of the variable <math>\\mathbf y</math>. A tilde over the letter n (<math>\\tilde{n}</math>) is sometimes used to indicate the [[harmonic mean]].\n\nIn machine learning, a tilde may represent a candidate value for a cell state in [[Gated recurrent unit|GRUs]] or [[LSTM]] units. (e.g. c\u0303)\n\n===Physics===\nOften in physics, one can consider an equilibrium solution to an equation, and then a perturbation to that equilibrium.  For the variables in the original equation (for instance <math>X</math>) a substitution <math>X\\to x+\\tilde{x}</math> can be made, where <math>x</math> is the equilibrium part and <math>\\tilde{x}</math> is the perturbed part.\n\nA tilde is also used in [[particle physics]] to denote the hypothetical [[supersymmetric]] partner.  For example, an [[electron]] is referred to by the letter ''e'', and its [[superpartner]] the [[selectron (particle)|selectron]] is written ''\u1ebd''.\n\n===Economics===\nFor relations involving preference, [[economist]]s sometimes use the tilde to represent [[Preference (economics)#Notation|indifference]] between two or more bundles of goods.  For example, to say that a consumer is indifferent between bundles ''x'' and ''y'', an economist would write ''x'' ~ ''y''.\n\n===Electronics===\nIt can approximate the sine wave symbol (\u223f, [[Unicode|U+]]223F), which is used in [[electronics]] to indicate [[alternating current]], in place of +, \u2212, or \u2393 for [[direct current]].\n\n===Linguistics===\nThe tilde may indicate alternating [[allomorph]]s or [[Morphophonology|morphological alternation]], as in {{IPA|//\u02c8ni\u02d0~\u025bl+t//}} for ''kneel~knelt'' (the plus sign '+' indicates a morpheme boundary).<ref>Collinge (2002) ''An Encyclopedia of Language'', \u00a74.2.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Hayes | first=Bruce | authorlink=Bruce Hayes (linguist) | title=Introductory Phonology | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=2011 | isbn=9781444360134 | pages=87\u201388 }}</ref>\n\n===Computing===\n\n==== Directories and URLs ====\nOn [[Unix]]-like [[operating system]]s (including [[AIX]], [[BSD]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]), tilde normally indicates the current user's [[home directory]]. For example, if the current user's home directory is {{mono|/home/user}}, then the command {{mono|cd ~}} is equivalent to {{mono|cd /home/user}}, {{mono|cd $HOME}}, or {{mono|cd}}. This convention derives from the [[Lear-Siegler]] [[ADM-3A]] terminal in common use during the 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word \"Home\" (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}<!-- may be true, but we need a source for \"derives\" --> When prepended to a particular username, the tilde indicates that user's home directory (e.g., {{mono|~janedoe}} for the home directory of user {{mono|janedoe}}, such as {{mono|/home/janedoe}}).<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Tilde expansion | publisher = The GNU project | title = C Library Manual | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = https://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html}}.</ref>\n\nUsed in [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] on the [[World Wide Web]], it often denotes a personal website on a [[Unix]]-based server. For example, {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/~johndoe/</nowiki>}} might be the personal web site of John Doe. This mimics the Unix shell usage of the tilde.  However, when accessed from the web, file access is usually directed to a [[subdirectory]] in the user's home directory, such as {{mono|/home/''username''/public_html}} or {{mono|/home/''username''/www}}.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Module mod_userdir | publisher = The Apache foundation | title = HTTP Server Documentation | edition = version 2.0 | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_userdir.html}}.</ref>\n\nIn URLs, the characters {{mono|%7E}} (or {{mono|%7e}}) may substitute for tilde if an input device lacks a tilde key.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-12 | title = RFC 3986 | publisher = IETF}}.</ref> Thus, {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/~johndoe/</nowiki>}} and {{mono|<nowiki>http://www.example.com/%7Ejohndoe/</nowiki>}} will behave in the same manner.\n\n==== Computer languages ====\nThe tilde is used in the [[AWK]] [[programming language]] as part of the pattern match operators for [[regular expression]]s:\n*<code>''variable'' ~ /''regex''/</code> returns true if the variable is matched.\n*<code>''variable'' !~ /''regex''/</code> returns false if the variable is matched.\n\nA variant of this, with the plain tilde replaced with <code>=~</code>, was adopted in [[Perl]], and this semi-standardization has led to the use of these operators in other programming languages, such as [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] or the [[SQL]] variant of the database [[PostgreSQL]].\n\nIn [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[MATLAB]], tilde represents the monadic logical function NOT, and in APL it additionally represents the dyadic [[multiset]] function ''without'' ([[Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement|set difference]]).\n\nIn the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming languages, the tilde character is used as [[bitwise NOT]] [[Operators in C and C++|operator]], following the notation in logic (an <code>!</code> causes a logical NOT, instead).  In C++ and C#, the tilde is also used as the first character in a [[Class (computer science)|class]]'s [[method (computer science)|method]] name (where the rest of the name must be the same name as the class) to indicate a [[destructor (computer science)|destructor]] \u2013 a special method which is called at the end of the [[Object lifetime|object's life]]. The [[MySQL|MySQL database]] also use tilde as bitwise invert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/bit-functions.html#operator_bitwise-invert|title=MySQL :: Reference Manual :: Bit Functions and Operators|last=|first=|date=|website=dev.mysql.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> \n\nIn ASP.NET application tilde ('~') is used as a shortcut to the root of the application's virtual directory.\n\nIn the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] stylesheet language, the tilde is used for the indirect adjacent combinator as part of a selector.\n\nIn the [[D programming language]], the tilde is used as an [[Array data structure|array]] [[concatenation]] operator, as well as to indicate an object destructor and bitwise not operator.  Tilde operator can be overloaded for user types, and binary tilde operator is mostly used to merging two objects, or adding some objects to set of objects. It was introduced because plus operator can have different meaning in many situations. For example, what to do with \"120\" + \"14\" ? Is this a string \"134\" (addition of two numbers), or \"12014\" (concatenation of strings) or something else? D disallows + operator for arrays (and strings), and provides separate operator for concatenation (similarly [[PHP]] programming language solved this problem by using dot operator for concatenation, and + for number addition, which will also work on strings containing numbers).\n\nIn [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], the tilde is used for object comparison. If ''a'' and ''b'' denote objects, the boolean expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' has value true if and only if these objects are equal, as defined by the applicable version of the library routine ''is_equal'', which by default denotes field-by-field object equality but can be redefined in any class to support a specific notion of equality. If ''a'' and ''b'' are references, the object equality expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is to be contrasted with ''a'' = ''b'' which denotes reference equality. Unlike the call ''a''.''is_equal'' (''b''), the expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is [[type safety|type-safe]] even in the presence of [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]].\n\nIn the [[Groovy (programming language)|Apache Groovy programming language]] the tilde character is used as an operator mapped to the bitwiseNegate() method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operator%20Overloading|title=The Groovy programming language - Operators|publisher=}}</ref> Given a String the method will produce a java.util.regex.Pattern.

A stand-alone tilde can be obtained by using <code>\\textasciitilde</code> or <code>\\string~</code>.\nIn \"math mode\" a tilde diacritic can be written as, e.g., <code>\\tilde{x}</code>. For a wider tilde <code>\\widetilde</code> can be used. The <code>\\sim</code> command produce a tilde-like binary relation symbol that is often used in mathematical expressions, and the double-tilde [[\u2248]] is obtained with <code>\\approx</code>. The <code>url</code> package also supports entering tildes directly, e.g., <code><nowiki>\\url{http://server/~name}</nowiki></code>.\nIn both text and math mode, a tilde on its own (<code>~</code>) renders a white space with no line breaking.\n\nIn [[MediaWiki]] [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], four tildes are used as a shortcut for a user's signature.\n\nIn [[Common Lisp]], the tilde is used as the prefix for format specifiers in format strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm |title=CLHS: Section 22.3 |publisher=Lispworks.com |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref>\nIn [[Max/MSP]], a tilde is used to denote objects that process at the computer's sampling rate, i.e. mainly those that deal with sound.\n\nIn [[Standard ML]], the tilde is used as the prefix for negative numbers and as the unary negation operator.\n\nIn [[OCaml]], the tilde is used to specify the label for a labeled parameter.\n\nIn Microsoft's SQL Server [[Transact-SQL|Transact-SQL (T-SQL)]] language, the tilde is a unary [[Bitwise NOT#NOT|Bitwise NOT]] operator.\n\nIn [[JavaScript]], the tilde is used as a unary [[Bitwise operation#NOT|bitwise complement]] (or bitwise negation) operation (<code>~number</code>). Because JavaScript internally uses floats and the bitwise complement only works on integers, numbers are stripped of their decimal part before applying the operation. This has also given rise to using '''two tildes''' <code>~~number</code> as a short syntax for a cast to integer (numbers are stripped of their decimal part and changed into their complement, and then back. The net result is thus only the removal of the decimal part). For positive numbers, this is equivalent to the mathematical ''[[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]]'' function.\n\nIn [[Object REXX]], the twiddle is used as a \"message send\" symbol. For example, <code>Employee.name~lower()</code> would cause the <code>lower()</code> method to act on the object <code>Employee</code>'s <code>name</code> attribute, returning the result of the operation. <code>~~</code> returns the object that received the method rather than the result produced. Thus it can be used when the result need not be returned or when cascading methods are to be used. <code>team~~insert(\"Jane\")~~insert(\"Joe\")~~insert(\"Steve\")</code> would send multiple concurrent <code>insert</code> messages, thus invoking the <code>insert</code> method three consecutive times on the <code>team</code> object.\n\n==== Backup filenames ====\nThe dominant [[Unix]] convention for naming backup copies of files is appending a tilde to the original file name.\nIt originated with the [[Emacs]] text editor<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names Emacs Manual]</ref> and was adopted by many other editors and some command-line tools.\n\nEmacs also introduced an elaborate numbered backup scheme, with files named {{mono|filename.~1~}}, {{mono|filename.~2~}} and so on.  It didn't catch on, as the rise of [[version control]] software eliminates the need for this usage.\n\n==== Microsoft filenames ====\nThe tilde was part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[filename mangling]] scheme when it extended the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system standard to support long filenames for [[Microsoft Windows]].  Programs written prior to this development could only access filenames in the so-called [[8.3 filename|8.3 format]]\u2014the filenames consisted of a maximum of eight characters from a restricted character set (e.g. no spaces), followed by a period, followed by three more characters.  In order to permit these legacy programs to access files in the FAT file system, each file had to be given two names\u2014one long, more descriptive one, and one that conformed to the 8.3 format.  This was accomplished with a name-mangling scheme in which the first six characters of the filename are followed by a tilde and a digit.  For example, \"{{mono|Program Files}}\" might become \"{{mono|PROGRA~1}}\".\n\nThe tilde symbol is also often used to prefix hidden temporary files that are created when a document is opened in Windows. For example, when a document \"Document1.doc\" is opened in Word, a file called \"~$cument1.doc\" is created in the same directory. This file contains information about which user has the file open, to prevent multiple users from attempting to change a document at the same time.\n\n==== Other uses ====\n[[Computer programmers]] use the tilde in various ways and sometimes call the symbol (as opposed to the diacritic) a '''squiggle''', '''squiggly''', or '''twiddle'''.  According to the [[Jargon File]], other synonyms sometimes used in programming include '''not''', '''approx''', '''wiggle''', '''enyay''' (after ''[[\u00f1|e\u00f1e]]'') and (humorously) '''sqiggle''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|k|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259l}}.  It is used in many languages as a binary inversion operator, swapping a number's binary 1's and 0's for example ~10 (binary ~1010) is equal to 5 (binary 0101).\n\nIn [[Raku (programming language)|Raku]], \"<nowiki>~~</nowiki>\" is used instead of \"[[=~]]\".\n\n===Juggling notation===\nIn the [[juggling notation]] system Beatmap, tilde can be added to either \"hand\" in a pair of fields to say \"cross the arms with this hand on top\".

This distinguishes it from the ''small tilde''&nbsp;( \u02dc ) introduced with [[Windows-1252]], which is always raised. But in some [[monospace font]]s, especially used in [[text user interface]]s, [[ASCII]] tilde character is raised too. This apparently is a legacy of [[typewriter]]s, where pairs of similar spacing and combining characters relied on one glyph. Even in [[line printer]]s' age character repertoires were often not large enough to distinguish between plain tilde, small tilde and combining tilde. Overprinting of a letter by the tilde was a working method of [[combining character|combining a letter]].\n\n==Keyboards==\nWhere a tilde is on the keyboard depends on the computer's language settings according to the following chart. On many keyboards it is primarily available through a [[dead key]] that makes it possible to produce a variety of [[precomposed character]]s with the diacritic.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In that case, a single tilde can typically be inserted with the dead key followed by the space bar, or alternatively by striking the dead key twice in a row.\n\nTo insert a tilde with the dead key, it is often necessary to simultaneously hold down the [[Alt Gr]] key. With a [[Macintosh]] either of the Alt/[[Option key|Option]] keys function similarly.\n\nIn the US and European [[Windows]] systems, the [[Alt code]] for a single tilde is <code>126</code>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Keyboard!!Insert a single tilde (~)!!Insert a precomposed character with tilde (e.g. \u00e3)\n|-\n|Arabic ([[Saudi Arabia]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`\u0630\u0651}}\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n|[[Croatian language|Croatian]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|-\n|[[Czech language|Czech]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|\n|-\n|[[Danish language|Danish]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|<nowiki>=</nowiki>}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift|'}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}</span>\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|<nowiki>=</nowiki>}} followed by the relevant letter, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift|'}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[English language|English]] ([[Australia]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|\n|-\n|English ([[Canada]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|\n|-\n|English ([[United Kingdom|UK]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|<nowiki>#</nowiki>}}\n|{{keypress|AltGr|#}} followed by the relevant letter ([[QWERTY#United Kingdom (Extended) Layout|UK-extended layout]], [[Chrome OS]])\n|-\n|English ([[United States|US]])\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}}\n|{{keypress|Ctrl|~}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00f0}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00f0}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Finnish language|Finnish]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}}{{keypress|\u00a8}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[French language|French]] ([[Canada]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}}{{keypress|\u00e7}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e7}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|French ([[France]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}}{{keypress|\u00e9}} <br />{{keypress|Option|n}} (on Mac OS X)\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00e9}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|French ([[Switzerland]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}}{{keypress|^}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[B\u00e9po]] (French Dvorak)\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|N}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|K}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|N}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[German language|German]] ([[Germany]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|+}}\n|\n|-\n|German ([[Switzerland]])\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}}{{keypress|^}}\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|^}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n| [[Hebrew]] ([[Israel]])\n| {{keypress|Shift|~}}\n| {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|~}} followed by the relevant letter\n|-\n|[[Hindi]] ([[India]])\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr|Shift}}+ the key to the left of {{keypress|1}}</span>\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]\n|<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{keypress|Alt Gr}}+{{keypress|1}}</span>\n|-\n|[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|'}} (the same key as {{keypress|?}})\n|-\n|[[Italian language|Italian]]\n|{{keypress|Option|5}} (on Mac OS X)\n{{Keypress|Alt Gr|\u00ec}} (on Linux)\n\n{{Keypress|Alt|1}}{{Keypress|2}}{{Keypress|6}} (on Windows)\n\n|-\n|[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}}{{keypress|\u00a8}}.\n\nOn Mac: {{keypress|Ctrl|Option|\u00a8}}, or {{keypress|Option|\u00a8}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}.\n|{{keypress|Alt Gr|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter.\n\nOn Mac: {{keypress|Option|\u00a8}} followed by the relevant letter.\n|-\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|{{keypress|Shift|`}} followed by {{keypress|Space}}, or\n{{keypress|Shift|`}}{{keypress|`}}\n|The dead key is not generally used for inserting characters with tilde;
