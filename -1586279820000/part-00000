{"title_page": "Lifestyle (sociology)", "text_new": "{{pp-semi-indef}}\n'''Lifestyle''' is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lifestyle Lifestyle] from [[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Lynn R. Kahle |author2=Angeline G. Close |title=Consumer Behavior Knowledge for Effective Sports and Event Marketing|year=2011|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-87358-1}}</ref> The term was introduced by Austrian psychologist [[Alfred Adler]] with the meaning of \"a person's basic character as established early in childhood\",<ref name=\"Online Etymology Dictionary\">[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lifestyle Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> as in his 1929 book, ''The Case of Miss R.'' The broader sense of lifestyle as a \"way or style of living\" has been documented since 1961.<ref name=\"Online Etymology Dictionary\"/> Lifestyle is a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to [[demographics|demographic]] variables, i.e. an individual's demographic profile, whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values, preferences, and outlooks.\n\nA rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban [[metropolis]]. Location is important even within an urban scope. The nature of the [[neighborhood]] in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods' degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments. For example, in areas near the sea, a [[surf culture]] or lifestyle can often be present.\n\n==Individual identity==\nA lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, way of life, values, or [[world view]]. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of [[Self-concept|self]] and to create cultural [[symbol]]s that resonate with personal identity. Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols she/he is able to project to others and the self.<ref>Spaargaren, G., and B. VanVliet (2000) \"Lifestyle, Consumption and the Environment:  The Ecological Modernisation of Domestic Consumption\", ''Environmental Politics'' '''9'''(1): 50-75.</ref>\n\nThe lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society.<ref>Giddens, A. (1991) ''Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age'', Cambridge: [[Polity Press]]</ref> For example, \"[[green lifestyle]]\" means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller [[ecological footprint]]), and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}</ref> Some commentators argue that, in [[modernity]], the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life.<ref>Ropke, I. (1999) \"The Dynamics of Willingness to Consume\", ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|]]'' 28: 399-420.</ref>\n\nLifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more. All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone's lifestyle.\n<ref>Giuffr\u00e2e, K., & DiGeronimo, T. (1999) ''Care and Feeding of Your Brain : How Diet and Environment Affect What You Think and Feel'', Career Press.</ref>\nIn the magazine and television industries, \"lifestyle\" is used to describe a category of publications or programs.\n\n==History of lifestyles studies==\n\nThree main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies:<ref>Berzano L., Genova C., ''Lifestyles and Subcultures. History and a New Perspective'', Routledge, London, 2015 (Part I).</ref>\n\n===Lifestyles and social position===\nEarlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals' relative positions inside it. [[Thorstein Veblen]], with his 'emulation' concept, opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific 'schemes of life', and in particular specific patterns of 'conspicuous consumption', depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior. [[Max Weber]] intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige: the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation, even within the same social class, and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire. [[Georg Simmel]] carries out formal analysis of lifestyles, at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation, identification, differentiation, and recognition, understood both as generating processes of, and effects generated by, lifestyles, operating \"vertically\" as well as \"horizontally\". Finally, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles, made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes, represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus.\n\n===Lifestyles as styles of thought===\nThe approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with [[Alfred Adler]], a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in [[Milton Rokeach]]'s work, [[Arnold Mitchell]]'s VALS research and [[Lynn Kahle]]'s LOV research, lifestyles' analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with [[Daniel Yankelovich]] and [[William Wells (social scientist)|William Wells]] we move on to the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles' components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in [[Bernard Cathelat]]'s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.\n\n===Lifestyles as styles of action===\nAnalysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles, or at least as their collateral component, but rather as a constitutive element. In the beginning, this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour, seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals\u2019 self-image and how they view their position in society. Subsequently, the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life, concentrating \u2013 as in authors such as [[Joffre Dumazedier]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] \u2013 on the use of time, especially loisirs, and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action. Finally, some authors, for instance [[Richard Jenkins]] and [[A. J. Veal]], suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive.\n\n==Health==\n\nA healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations. According to the study done by Case et al. (2002), when a 0-3-year-old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle.<ref>Ponthiere G. (2011) \"Mortality, Family and Lifestyles\", ''Journal of Family and Economic Issues'' '''32''' (2): 175-190</ref> For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat more fruit and vegetables, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low-income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression.<ref>Case, A., Lubotsky D. & Paxson C. (2002) \"Economic Status and Health in Childhood: The Origins of the Gradient\", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' '''92'''(5): 1308-1334</ref> Parents are the first teacher for every child. Everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process.\n\nAdults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle. For example, [[William Dufty]] described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations:<ref>[[William Dufty]] (1975) ''[[Sugar Blues]]'', page 204</ref>\n: {{quotation| I have come to know hundreds of young people who have found that illness or bingeing on drugs and sugar became the doorway to health. Once they reestablished their own health, we had in common our interest in food. If one can use that overworked word lifestyle, we shared a sugarfree lifestyle. I kept in touch with many of them in campuses and communes, through their travels here and abroad and everywhere. One day you meet them in Boston. The next week you run into them in Southern California.}}\n\n==Class==\nLifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u00f6genhold|first=Dieter|title=Social Inequality and the Sociology of Life Style: Material and Cultural Aspects of Social Stratification|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=60|issue=4|pages=829\u2013847|doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00125|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Media culture==\nThe term '''lifestyle''' was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of [[Style (aesthetics)|style in art]]:<ref name=\"Bernstein1991p23Diversity\">Bernstein (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23 p.23]</ref>\n: {{quotation|\"Life-styles\", the culture industry\u2019s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}\n\n[[Theodor W. Adorno]] noted that there is a \"culture industry\" in which the [[mass media]] is involved, but that the term \"mass culture\" is inappropriate:\n<ref name=\"Adorno1963mass\">Adorno [1963] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98 p.98]</ref> \n:{{quotation|In our drafts, we spoke of \"mass culture.\" We replaced that expression with \"culture industry\" in order to exclude from the outset the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}\n\nThe [[media culture]] of [[advanced capitalism]] typically creates new \"life-styles\" to drive the consumption of new commodities:<ref name=\"Bernstein1991p23Diversity\"/>{{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s, the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and \"different\" commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative \"life-styles.\"}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)|Aeromobility]]\n* [[Alternative lifestyle]]\n* [[Life stance]]\n* [[Lifestyle brand]]\n* [[Lifestyle guru]]\n* [[Lifestyle management]]\n* [[Otium]]\n* [[Personal life]]\n* [[Sustainable living]]\n* [[Simple living]]\n* [[Style of life]]\n* [[Tao]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*Adorno, Th., \"Culture Industry Reconsidered,\" in Adorno (1991).\n*Adorno, The Culture Industry - Selected essays on mass culture, Routledge, London, 1991.\n*Amaturo E., Palumbo M., Classi sociali.

Close |title=Consumer Behavior Knowledge for Effective Sports and Event Marketing|year=2011|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-87358-1}}</ref> The term was introduced by Austrian psychologist [[Alfred Adler]] with the meaning of \"a person's basic character as established early in childhood\",<ref name=\"Online Etymology Dictionary\">[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lifestyle Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> as in his 1929 book, ''The Case of Miss R.'' The broader sense of lifestyle as a \"way or style of living\" has been documented since 1961.<ref name=\"Online Etymology Dictionary\"/> Lifestyle is a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to [[demographics|demographic]] variables, i.e. an individual's demographic profile, whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values, preferences, and outlooks.\n\nA rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban [[metropolis]]. Location is important even within an urban scope. The nature of the [[neighborhood]] in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods' degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments. For example, in areas near the sea, a [[surf culture]] or lifestyle can often be present.\n\n==Individual identity==\nA lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, way of life, values, or [[world view]]. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of [[Self-concept|self]] and to create cultural [[symbol]]s that resonate with personal identity. Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols she/he is able to project to others and the self.<ref>Spaargaren, G., and B. VanVliet (2000) \"Lifestyle, Consumption and the Environment:  The Ecological Modernisation of Domestic Consumption\", ''Environmental Politics'' '''9'''(1): 50-75.</ref>\n\nThe lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society.<ref>Giddens, A. (1991) ''Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age'', Cambridge: [[Polity Press]]</ref> For example, \"[[green lifestyle]]\" means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller [[ecological footprint]]), and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}</ref> Some commentators argue that, in [[modernity]], the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life.<ref>Ropke, I. (1999) \"The Dynamics of Willingness to Consume\", ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|]]'' 28: 399-420.</ref>\n\nLifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more. All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone's lifestyle.\n<ref>Giuffr\u00e2e, K., & DiGeronimo, T. (1999) ''Care and Feeding of Your Brain : How Diet and Environment Affect What You Think and Feel'', Career Press.</ref>\nIn the magazine and television industries, \"lifestyle\" is used to describe a category of publications or programs.\n\n==History of lifestyles studies==\n\nThree main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies:<ref>Berzano L., Genova C., ''Lifestyles and Subcultures. History and a New Perspective'', Routledge, London, 2015 (Part I).</ref>\n\n===Lifestyles and social position===\nEarlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals' relative positions inside it. [[Thorstein Veblen]], with his 'emulation' concept, opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific 'schemes of life', and in particular specific patterns of 'conspicuous consumption', depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior. [[Max Weber]] intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige: the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation, even within the same social class, and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire. [[Georg Simmel]] carries out formal analysis of lifestyles, at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation, identification, differentiation, and recognition, understood both as generating processes of, and effects generated by, lifestyles, operating \"vertically\" as well as \"horizontally\". Finally, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles, made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes, represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus.\n\n===Lifestyles as styles of thought===\nThe approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with [[Alfred Adler]], a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in [[Milton Rokeach]]'s work, [[Arnold Mitchell]]'s VALS research and [[Lynn Kahle]]'s LOV research, lifestyles' analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with [[Daniel Yankelovich]] and [[William Wells (social scientist)|William Wells]] we move on to the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles' components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in [[Bernard Cathelat]]'s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.\n\n===Lifestyles as styles of action===\nAnalysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles, or at least as their collateral component, but rather as a constitutive element. In the beginning, this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour, seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals\u2019 self-image and how they view their position in society. Subsequently, the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life, concentrating \u2013 as in authors such as [[Joffre Dumazedier]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] \u2013 on the use of time, especially loisirs, and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action. Finally, some authors, for instance [[Richard Jenkins]] and [[A. J. Veal]], suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive.\n\n==Health==\n\nA healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations. According to the study done by Case et al. (2002), when a 0-3 year old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle.<ref>Ponthiere G. (2011) \"Mortality, Family and Lifestyles\", ''Journal of Family and Economic Issues'' '''32''' (2): 175-190</ref> For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat more fruit and vegetables, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low-income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression.<ref>Case, A., Lubotsky D. & Paxson C. (2002) \"Economic Status and Health in Childhood: The Origins of the Gradient\", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' '''92'''(5): 1308-1334</ref> Parents are the first teacher for every child. Everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process.\n\nAdults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle. For example, [[William Dufty]] described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations:<ref>[[William Dufty]] (1975) ''[[Sugar Blues]]'', page 204</ref>\n: {{quotation| I have come to know hundreds of young people who have found that illness or bingeing on drugs and sugar became the doorway to health. Once they reestablished their own health, we had in common our interest in food. If one can use that overworked word lifestyle, we shared a sugarfree lifestyle. I kept in touch with many of them in campuses and communes, through their travels here and abroad and everywhere. One day you meet them in Boston. The next week you run into them in Southern California.}}\n\n==Class==\nLifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u00f6genhold|first=Dieter|title=Social Inequality and the Sociology of Life Style: Material and Cultural Aspects of Social Stratification|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=60|issue=4|pages=829\u2013847|doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00125|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Media culture==\nThe term '''lifestyle''' was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of [[Style (aesthetics)|style in art]]:<ref name=\"Bernstein1991p23Diversity\">Bernstein (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23 p.23]</ref>\n: {{quotation|\"Life-styles\", the culture industry\u2019s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}\n\n[[Theodor W. Adorno]] noted that there is a \"culture industry\" in which the [[mass media]] is involved, but that the term \"mass culture\" is inappropriate:\n<ref name=\"Adorno1963mass\">Adorno [1963] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98 p.98]</ref> \n:{{quotation|In our drafts, we spoke of \"mass culture.\" We replaced that expression with \"culture industry\" in order to exclude from the outset the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}\n\nThe [[media culture]] of [[advanced capitalism]] typically creates new \"life-styles\" to drive the consumption of new commodities:<ref name=\"Bernstein1991p23Diversity\"/>{{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s, the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and \"different\" commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative \"life-styles.\"}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)|Aeromobility]]\n* [[Alternative lifestyle]]\n* [[Life stance]]\n* [[Lifestyle brand]]\n* [[Lifestyle guru]]\n* [[Lifestyle management]]\n* [[Otium]]\n* [[Personal life]]\n* [[Sustainable living]]\n* [[Simple living]]\n* [[Style of life]]\n* [[Tao]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*Adorno, Th., \"Culture Industry Reconsidered,\" in Adorno (1991).\n*Adorno, The Culture Industry - Selected essays on mass culture, Routledge, London, 1991.\n*Amaturo E., Palumbo M., Classi sociali.

The airport had two dirt runways, one oiled, but no fueling or servicing facilities. In 1941 the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] began improvements to the airport for national defense purposes that included two {{Convert|4500 x 150|ft|m}} asphalt runways and a taxiway. Kern County agreed the airport could be taken over by the military in the event of war.<ref name=\"californiamilitaryhistory.org\">{{cite web |url=http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/MCASMojave.html/ |title=Historic California Posts: Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station, Mojave |work=California State Military Department |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424162414/http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/MCASMojave.html |archivedate=April 24, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, the [[United States Marine Corps]] took over the airport and expanded it into Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station (MCAAS) Mojave. The two runways were extended and a third one added. Barracks were constructed to house 2,734 male and 376 female military personnel. Civilian employment at the base would peak at 176. The Marines would eventually spend more than $7 million on the base, which totaled {{Convert|2312|acre|}}.<ref name=\"californiamilitaryhistory.org\"/>\n\nMany of the Corps' World War II [[Flying ace|aces]] received their gunnery training at Mojave. During World War II, Mojave hosted 29 aircraft squadrons, four Carrier Aircraft Service Detachments, and three Air Warning Squadrons. At its peak, the air station had 145 training and other aircraft. Mojave also had a 75 x 156 foot swimming pool that was used to train aviators in emergency water egress and for recreation. The base's 900-seat auditorium hosted several USO shows that featured [[Bob Hope]], [[Frances Langford]] and [[Marilyn Maxwell]].<ref name=\"californiamilitaryhistory.org\"/>\n\nWith the end of World War II, MCAAS was disestablished on February 7, 1946; a [[United States Navy]] Air Station was established the same day. The Navy used the airport for drone operations for less than a year, closing it on January 1, 1947. The base remained closed for four years until the outbreak of the Korean War. Mojave was reactivated as an auxiliary landing field to [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|MCAS El Toro]].\n\nIn 1951 scenes from the movie ''[[The Las Vegas Story (film)|The Las Vegas Story]]'' were filmed at the deserted airport. A helicopter chased a car around the base, at several points flying at speed through an open-ended hangar. The control tower shown on the RHS of this article was featured at the climax of the chase. \n\nOn 22 August 1951 the [[11th Naval District]] announced the award to R. R.

Marine Corps reserve units were temporarily deployed to Mojave for two-week periods. MCAAS Mojave personnel peaked at 400 military and 200 civilians during this period.\n\nIn 1961, after the Marine Corps transferred operations to [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|MCAS El Centro]], [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] obtained title to the airport. In February 1972, the East Kern Airport District (EKAD) was formed to administer the airport; EKAD maintains the airport to this day. To a great extent EKAD was the brainchild of Kern County rancher and aviator Dan Sabovich, who heavily lobbied the state for the airport district's creation and ran EKAD until 2002.<ref name=\"About Mojave Air & Space Port\"/>\n\nIn 1974-79 [[Golden West Airlines]] scheduled [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s direct to Los Angeles ([[LAX]]).<ref>https://www.departedflights.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912034130/http://departedflights.com/ |date=2017-09-12 }}, Golden West timetables & maps</ref>\n\nOn November 20, 2012 the EKAD Board of Directors voted to change the name of the district to the Mojave Air and Space Port. Officials said that the spaceport name is well known around the world, but EKAD is not. The change took effect on January 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2012/11/23/mojave-spaceport-governing-district-changes-its-name/ |title=Mojave Spaceport Governing District Changes Its Name |work=Douglas Messier |accessdate=July 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nBesides being a general-use public airport, Mojave has three main areas of activity: flight testing, space industry development, and aircraft heavy maintenance and storage.\n\n===Air racing===\nThe airport has a rich history in [[air racing]]. In 1970, a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) Unlimited race was held\u2014the first closed-course pylon race to include pit stops. The race was notable in that it featured a [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7]] that flew non-stop and finished sixth out of twenty aircraft.  The race was won by Sherm Cooper in a highly modified [[Hawker Sea Fury]] which also flew non-stop.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Sport Aviation|date=January 1971|title=Air Racing News}}</ref> The following year the race was shortened to {{Convert|1000|km|}}, and was again won by a Hawker Sea Fury, this time flown by Frank Sanders. From 1973 to 1979 Air Race Management (run by famed race pilots [[Clay Lacy]] and [[Lyle Shelton]]) organized a series of Reno-syle races at Mojave featuring Unlimiteds, T-6's, [[Formula One Air Racing|Formula-1's]], and Biplanes.  In 1973 and '74, the program also included jet races.  Unlimited winners at Mojave included Lyle Shelton in 1973, Mac McClain in 1974 and 1976, Dr. Cliff Cummins in 1975, and [[Steve Hinton]] in 1978 and '79. The races at Mojave were hampered by constant winds, and extreme temperatures.  In the 2000s, [[California State Route 58|California HWY 58]] was extended to bypass the town of Mojave, which cut directly across the race course\u2014thus precluding any future racing events on the site. In 1983, Frank Taylor set the 15&nbsp;kilometer (9.3 mile) closed-course speed record at {{Convert|517|mph|}} at Mojave in the [[P-51 Mustang|P-51 Dago Red]]. Over the years, several notable teams have been based out of Mojave. [[Wasabi Air Racing]] is the only pylon racing team currently active at the airport. In 1990 Scaled Composites rolled out the radical [[Scaled Composites Pond Racer|Pond Racer]] \u2013 built and tested on-site. During the mid-1990s, the Museum of Flying based its two racers [[Dago Red]] and Stiletto out of Mojave as well.  And since the early 1980s, the oft-talked about{{by whom|date=November 2014}}, but rarely seen Wildfire (a custom built Unlimited based around a T-6 airframe) has slowly been developed in a Mojave hangar. Ralph Wise's many air racing projects including the Sport Class Legal GT400 and his V-8 powered unlimited, the GT500, both were designed and built at Mojave (the GT500 spent its early life at [[Camarillo Airport|Camarillo]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. The GT 400 Quicksilver ultralight program is also based out of Mojave airport.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Flight testing===\nFlight testing activities have been centered at Mojave since the early 1970s, due to the lack of populated areas surrounding the airport. It is also favored for this purpose due to its proximity to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], where the airspace is restricted from ground level to an unlimited height, and where there is a supersonic corridor. Mojave is also the home of the [[National Test Pilot School]], [[Scaled Composites]] and [[Virgin Galactic]]/[[The Spaceship Company]].\n\n===Space industry development===\nBeginning with the [[Rotary Rocket]] program, Mojave became a focus for small companies seeking a place to develop space access technologies. Mojave Spaceport has been a test site for several teams in the [[Ansari X Prize]], most notably the [[Scaled Composites]] [[SpaceShipOne]], which conducted the first privately funded human sub-orbital flight on June 21, 2004. Other groups based at the Mojave Spaceport include [[XCOR Aerospace]], [[Masten Space Systems]], [[Virgin Galactic]], [[The Spaceship Company]], [[Stratolaunch Systems]], and [[Firestar Technologies]].<ref name=a&ss20110501>\n{{cite journal |last=Joiner|first=Stephen |title=The Mojave Launch Lab |journal=Air & Space Smithsonian |date=2011-05-01 |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/The-Mojave-Launch-Lab.html |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref><ref name=kge20150201>\n{{cite news |title=KGET Special Report: Mojave Air and SpacePort |url=http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/specialreports/story/d/story/kget-special-report-mojave-air-and-spaceport/84740/3hrM3k6tfEyhH0EWMVkSIw |accessdate=18 February 2015 |work=Kern Golden Empire |date=1 February 2015 |quote=Mojave Air and Spaceport is the epicentre of privately-funded commercial space flight research and development. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218055359/http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/specialreports/story/d/story/kget-special-report-mojave-air-and-spaceport/84740/3hrM3k6tfEyhH0EWMVkSIw |archivedate=18 February 2015 }}</ref>\nOther companies at Mojave include [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], [[NASA]] and [[Interorbital Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe East Kern Airport District was given spaceport status by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for the Mojave Air and Spaceport through June 16, 2019.<ref name=faa20100101>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/current_licenses/ |title=Active Commercial Space Licenses |work=FAA |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |date=February 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=kge20150201/>\n\n===Aircraft heavy maintenance, storage and event center===\nThe Mojave airport is also known as a storage location for commercial airliners, due to the vast area and dry desert conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mojaveairport.com/aircraftstorage.htm |title=Aircraft Storage|accessdate=2009-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229215342/http://www.mojaveairport.com/aircraftstorage.htm |archivedate=2009-12-29 }} Mojave Air and Space Port \u2013 Aircraft Storage</ref>  Numerous [[Boeing]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], and [[Airbus]] jetliners including wide-body aircraft previously or currently owned by major domestic and international airlines are stored at Mojave.

The two runways were extended and a third one added. Barracks were constructed to house 2,734 male and 376 female military personnel. Civilian employment at the base would peak at 176. The Marines would eventually spend more than $7 million on the base, which totaled {{Convert|2312|acre|}}.<ref name=\"californiamilitaryhistory.org\"/>\n\nMany of the Corps' World War II [[Flying ace|aces]] received their gunnery training at Mojave. During World War II, Mojave hosted 29 aircraft squadrons, four Carrier Aircraft Service Detachments, and three Air Warning Squadrons. At its peak, the air station had 145 training and other aircraft. Mojave also had a 75 x 156 foot swimming pool that was used to train aviators in emergency water egress and for recreation. The base's 900-seat auditorium hosted several USO shows that featured [[Bob Hope]], [[Frances Langford]] and [[Marilyn Maxwell]].<ref name=\"californiamilitaryhistory.org\"/>\n\nWith the end of World War II, MCAAS was disestablished on February 7, 1946; a [[United States Navy]] Air Station was established the same day. The Navy used the airport for drone operations for less than a year, closing it on January 1, 1947. The base remained closed for four years until the outbreak of the Korean War. Mojave was reactivated as an auxiliary landing field to [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|MCAS El Toro]].\n\nIn 1951 scenes from the movie ''[[The Las Vegas Story (film)|The Las Vegas Story]]'' were filmed at the deserted airport. A helicopter chased a car around the base, at several points flying at speed through an open-ended hangar. The control tower shown on the RHS of this article was featured at the climax of the chase. \n\nOn 22 August 1951 the [[11th Naval District]] announced the award to R. R.

Marine Corps reserve units were temporarily deployed to Mojave for two-week periods. MCAAS Mojave personnel peaked at 400 military and 200 civilians during this period.\n\nIn 1961, after the Marine Corps transferred operations to [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|MCAS El Centro]], [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] obtained title to the airport. In February 1972, the East Kern Airport District (EKAD) was formed to administer the airport; EKAD maintains the airport to this day. To a great extent EKAD was the brainchild of Kern County rancher and aviator Dan Sabovich, who heavily lobbied the state for the airport district's creation and ran EKAD until 2002.<ref name=\"About Mojave Air & Space Port\"/>\n\nIn 1974-79 [[Golden West Airlines]] scheduled [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s direct to Los Angeles ([[LAX]]).<ref>https://www.departedflights.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912034130/http://departedflights.com/ |date=2017-09-12 }}, Golden West timetables & maps</ref>\n\nOn November 20, 2012 the EKAD Board of Directors voted to change the name of the district to the Mojave Air and Space Port. Officials said that the spaceport name is well known around the world, but EKAD is not. The change took effect on January 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2012/11/23/mojave-spaceport-governing-district-changes-its-name/ |title=Mojave Spaceport Governing District Changes Its Name |work=Douglas Messier |accessdate=July 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nBesides being a general-use public airport, Mojave has three main areas of activity: flight testing, space industry development, and aircraft heavy maintenance and storage.\n\n===Air racing===\nThe airport has a rich history in [[air racing]]. In 1970, a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) Unlimited race was held\u2014the first closed-course pylon race to include pit stops. The race was notable in that it featured a [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7]] that flew non-stop and finished sixth out of twenty aircraft.  The race was won by Sherm Cooper in a highly modified [[Hawker Sea Fury]] which also flew non-stop.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Sport Aviation|date=January 1971|title=Air Racing News}}</ref> The following year the race was shortened to {{Convert|1000|km|}}, and was again won by a Hawker Sea Fury, this time flown by Frank Sanders. From 1973 to 1979 Air Race Management (run by famed race pilots [[Clay Lacy]] and [[Lyle Shelton]]) organized a series of Reno-syle races at Mojave featuring Unlimiteds, T-6's, [[Formula One Air Racing|Formula-1's]], and Biplanes.  In 1973 and '74, the program also included jet races.  Unlimited winners at Mojave included Lyle Shelton in 1973, Mac McClain in 1974 and 1976, Dr. Cliff Cummins in 1975, and [[Steve Hinton]] in 1978 and '79. The races at Mojave were hampered by constant winds, and extreme temperatures.  In the 2000s, [[California State Route 58|California HWY 58]] was extended to bypass the town of Mojave, which cut directly across the race course\u2014thus precluding any future racing events on the site. In 1983, Frank Taylor set the 15&nbsp;kilometer (9.3 mile) closed-course speed record at {{Convert|517|mph|}} at Mojave in the [[P-51 Mustang|P-51 Dago Red]]. Over the years, several notable teams have been based out of Mojave. [[Wasabi Air Racing]] is the only pylon racing team currently active at the airport. In 1990 Scaled Composites rolled out the radical [[Scaled Composites Pond Racer|Pond Racer]] \u2013 built and tested on-site. During the mid-90's, the Museum of Flying based its two racers [[Dago Red]] and Stiletto out of Mojave as well.  And since the early '80's, the oft-talked about{{by whom|date=November 2014}}, but rarely seen Wildfire (a custom built Unlimited based around a T-6 airframe) has slowly been developed in a Mojave hangar. Ralph Wise's many air racing projects including the Sport Class Legal GT400 and his V-8 powered unlimited, the GT500, both were designed and built at Mojave (the GT500 spent its early life at [[Camarillo Airport|Camarillo]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. The GT 400 Quicksilver ultralight program is also based out of Mojave airport.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Flight testing===\nFlight testing activities have been centered at Mojave since the early 1970s, due to the lack of populated areas surrounding the airport. It is also favored for this purpose due to its proximity to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], where the airspace is restricted from ground level to an unlimited height, and where there is a supersonic corridor. Mojave is also the home of the [[National Test Pilot School]], [[Scaled Composites]] and [[Virgin Galactic]]/[[The Spaceship Company]].\n\n===Space industry development===\nBeginning with the [[Rotary Rocket]] program, Mojave became a focus for small companies seeking a place to develop space access technologies. Mojave Spaceport has been a test site for several teams in the [[Ansari X Prize]], most notably the [[Scaled Composites]] [[SpaceShipOne]], which conducted the first privately funded human sub-orbital flight on June 21, 2004. Other groups based at the Mojave Spaceport include [[XCOR Aerospace]], [[Masten Space Systems]], [[Virgin Galactic]], [[The Spaceship Company]], [[Stratolaunch Systems]], and [[Firestar Technologies]].<ref name=a&ss20110501>\n{{cite journal |last=Joiner|first=Stephen |title=The Mojave Launch Lab |journal=Air & Space Smithsonian |date=2011-05-01 |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/The-Mojave-Launch-Lab.html |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref><ref name=kge20150201>\n{{cite news |title=KGET Special Report: Mojave Air and SpacePort |url=http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/specialreports/story/d/story/kget-special-report-mojave-air-and-spaceport/84740/3hrM3k6tfEyhH0EWMVkSIw |accessdate=18 February 2015 |work=Kern Golden Empire |date=1 February 2015 |quote=Mojave Air and Spaceport is the epicentre of privately-funded commercial space flight research and development. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218055359/http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/specialreports/story/d/story/kget-special-report-mojave-air-and-spaceport/84740/3hrM3k6tfEyhH0EWMVkSIw |archivedate=18 February 2015 }}</ref>\nOther companies at Mojave include [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], [[NASA]] and [[Interorbital Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe East Kern Airport District was given spaceport status by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for the Mojave Air and Spaceport through June 16, 2019.<ref name=faa20100101>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data/current_licenses/ |title=Active Commercial Space Licenses |work=FAA |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |date=February 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=kge20150201/>\n\n===Aircraft heavy maintenance, storage and event center===\nThe Mojave airport is also known as a storage location for commercial airliners, due to the vast area and dry desert conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mojaveairport.com/aircraftstorage.htm |title=Aircraft Storage|accessdate=2009-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229215342/http://www.mojaveairport.com/aircraftstorage.htm |archivedate=2009-12-29 }} Mojave Air and Space Port \u2013 Aircraft Storage</ref>  Numerous [[Boeing]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], and [[Airbus]] jetliners including wide-body aircraft previously or currently owned by major domestic and international airlines are stored at Mojave.

The developed area in Chaguaramas starts at ALCOA and ends at the Army and  Coast Guard camps on the mainland. In the description or context of \"developed area\"  one  excludes the five islands which are in various stages of development or redevelopment as of 2016. However in the information below, some data is included on the Five Islands (5 Islands)\n\nMost of the roadway in Chaguaramas lies close to the coast line and one can view the sea from the winding road. According to Google Maps, Chaguaramas is about fourteen kilometres (14&nbsp;km) from Port of Spain.<ref>Directions from POS http://www.distancesfrom.com/tt/directions-from-Port-of-Spain-to-Chaguaramas/DirectionHistory/7775236.aspx</ref>\n\n==Leasing of Chaguaramas to the United States==\n[[File:TuckerValleyTrackingStation Trinidad.JPG|thumb|left|[[U.S. Air Force]] [[Eastern Test Range]]]]\nThe entire peninsula was leased to the [[United States]] in 1940 for the construction of a [[naval base]] under the ''[[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]''.\n\nThe base was also used during the early 1960s as a [[BMEWS]] early warning radar site, as well as a missile tracking site on the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Eastern Test Range]].\nThe base was scaled back in 1956 and the area was returned to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] control in 1963.<ref>[http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm Chaguaramas History at the Chaguaramas Development Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820034747/http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm |date=August 20, 2008 }}</ref><ref>http://chaguaramas.com/discovery-zone/chaguaramas-history/march-on-chaguaramas</ref>\n\n==Treaty of Chaguaramas/CARICOM==\nChaguaramas was the location slated for the construction of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].  It is also the place where the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] was signed, establishing [[Caricom]], the Caribbean Community and Common Market, in 1973.\n\n==Activities and Places of Interest==\n\n===Dry forests===\nThe Chaguaramas Peninsula supports one of the few remaining areas of [[Trinidad and Tobago dry forests|dry forest]] in western Trinidad.\n\n=== Cycling and kayaking===\nOn weekends groups of persons enter Chaguaramas to cycle on or kayak <ref>Discover TT http://www.discover-tt.net/marinas/kayaking.html</ref> in rented equipment. During the week, the roadway is used as a training ground for persons who cycle <ref>Trini Outdoors http://www.trinoutdoors.com/pages/trinidad_cycling_areas.htm</ref> in groups either for sport or as a part of a training session for a Tri-athalon.  Mountain biking has grown in popularity and an extensive trail network has been developed in Tucker Valley.  These trails are created and maintained by the local Mountain Bike community.\n\n===The Chaguaramas Boardwalk Area===\nThe Chaguaramas Boardwalk was developed by the Chaguaramas Development Authority (CDA)<ref>CDA http://chaguaramas.com/</ref> as part of its tourism developmental thrust. The Boardwalk stretches for approximately 1300 feet <ref>Business Guardian http://www.guardian.co.tt/business-guardian/2012-03-29/under-chaguaramas-boardwalk</ref> along the shore of one of the Bays. The Boardwalk can be used as an exercise route for pedestrians or for young families who stroll or as a stepping stone to get to the water to swim for leisure or as part of a training regimen.\n\nAvailable in close proximity to the Boardwalk are Gazebos and Pedal Boats which are available for rent.  There is also the Dancing Water Fountain, the Trees Vendor Plaza and Miniature Off Road Activities according to the CDA's website.<ref>CDA Things to Do http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/boardwalk</ref>\n\n===Chaguaramas Golf Course===\nThe Chaguaramas Golf Course is \"a 9-hole course\" and the only \"public\" golf course in the twin-island Republic. The Golf Course at Chaguaramas has been in existence for some forty plus (40+) years and is one of the older, if not the oldest golf course in the island.<ref>CDA Golf Course http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/golf-course</ref>\n\n===Pier 1===\nPier 1 was designed to host functions for large numbers of persons. The venue was designed to host events in small areas within a larger setting, thus it can serve a large number of persons with different tastes through the use of the smaller areas as niche spots.<ref>http://www.discovertnt.com/articles/Trinidad/Touring-Trinidad-pt-4-the-Northwest-Peninsula/167/3/23#axzz4BEltV7t3</ref>\n\n===Yacht===\nChaguaramas has been the center of yachting activity in Trinidad. There are several marinas <ref>Carnaval.Com Trinidad Chag http://www.carnaval.com/trinidad/chag/</ref> within the Chaguaramas area which provide repair services or on-land boarding services for yachts. There is also the option to refuel and stock supplies or just moor the yacht at a pier or in a sheltered bay facility and visit the island.\n\n===Heritage Parks, Macqueripe and The Magnificent Edith Falls===\nAccording to the CDA, the Gasparee Cave on Gasparee Island,<ref>Perceptions - Sea visible on the Way to the Gasparee Caves, Trinidad and Tobago http://jennifernbailey245.blogspot.com/2015/09/perceptions.html</ref> along with the Salt Pond on Chacachacare and the Bellerand Heritage Park fall within the boundaries of Chaguaramas.<ref>Chaguaramas Info http://chaguaramas.com/about-cda/chag-info#in-chaguaramas</ref> Although Gasparee has been developed with housing facilities, to a large extent efforts have been made to preserve the birds on the island, through the \"upkeep\" of the large trees which provide shelter at great heights for them.\n\n\"Conveniently located just off the Macqueripe Road, Bellerand Heritage Park is surrounded by various areas offering recreational activities such as golfing, swimming and is a 'stone's throw' away from the Magnificent Edith Falls\".<ref>CDA http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/heritage-parks</ref> Another heritage park which is located within the Macqueripe area in Chaguaramas is Samaan Park.\n\nAt Macqueripe, one is allowed to swim in the sea as the area is located in an inlet. However great care should be exercised in entering and exiting the water as due to dredging of the sea bed many years ago, there is a sharp descent of several feet close to the shore. The drop/ or descent can make the area perilous for newly trained swimmers and the extremely short person entering or exiting the water.\n\n===Tucker Valley===\nTucker Valley is known for several points of interest such as: The Bamboo Cathedral, <ref>http://www.trinoutdoors.com/pages/trinidad_cycling_areas.htm,</ref>, The  UPick Farm and Restaurant, The World War Bunker, and The Nutmeg Grove <ref>Trin Tours http://www.trintours.com/cruisetrinidad.htm</ref> among other things.\n\nThe Bamboo Cathedral is well known by photographers who capture images of many newly engaged couples strolling in the area. The wide lane of the roadway with the bamboos intertwining overhead creates an image of seclusion and sets the tone for newly engaged wonder!\n\nThe UPick Farm \"sells a wide range of  fruits and vegetables (grown off-site) both local and imported\".<ref>Trini Chow https://trinichow.com/2015/12/30/u-pick-farm-chaguaramas-trinidad/</ref> Also available at the UPick Farm are guided tours and field trips for primary and secondary school children.\n\n===DockSide Facilities===\nThe Chaguaramas area also contains some dockside facilities, mostly for the transfer of [[bauxite]] ore between ship and shore, or from smaller boats to ocean-going vessels. The function of such docks is easily recognizable as the docks and buildings are colored pink from the bauxite dust.\n\n===Hunting and Fising===\nAfter the Trinidad and Tobago government passed the Conservation and Wildlife Act in 1960, hunting is strictly prohibited. This law is upheld by the Chaguaramas Development Authority. Chaguaramas is however one of the country's most popular spots for [[Tarpon]] fishing. In 2010, Sportsfishing Magazine names Chaguaramas waters one of their top locations for fishing Tarpon. <ref>http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/hunting-and-fishing</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Williams Bay Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|Looking West across Williams Bay during Dragon Boat racing in Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago\nFile:Chaguaramas Trinidad Drydock.jpg|A [[Drydock]] in Chaguaramas\nFile:Bamboo Cathedral Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|The \"Bamboo Cathedral\" on the road to the Tracking Station in Chaguaramas\nFile:Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|A warehouse harbour in Chaguaramas\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''Transatlantic Sketches, Comprising Visits to the Most Scenes in North and South'', by Sir Richard Alexander.

However in the information below, some data is included on the Five Islands (5 Islands)\n\nMost of the roadway in Chaguaramas lies close to the coast line and one can view the sea from the winding road. According to Google Maps, Chaguaramas is about fourteen kilometres (14&nbsp;km) from Port of Spain.<ref>Directions from POS http://www.distancesfrom.com/tt/directions-from-Port-of-Spain-to-Chaguaramas/DirectionHistory/7775236.aspx</ref>\n\n==Leasing of Chaguaramas to the United States==\n[[File:TuckerValleyTrackingStation Trinidad.JPG|thumb|left|[[U.S. Air Force]] [[Eastern Test Range]]]]\nThe entire peninsula was leased to the [[United States]] in 1940 for the construction of a [[naval base]] under the ''[[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]''.\n\nThe base was also used during the early 1960s as a [[BMEWS]] early warning radar site, as well as a missile tracking site on the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Eastern Test Range]].\nThe base was scaled back in 1956 and the area was returned to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] control in 1963.<ref>[http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm Chaguaramas History at the Chaguaramas Development Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820034747/http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm |date=August 20, 2008 }}</ref><ref>http://chaguaramas.com/discovery-zone/chaguaramas-history/march-on-chaguaramas</ref>\n\n==Treaty of Chaguaramas/CARICOM==\nChaguaramas was the location slated for the construction of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].  It is also the place where the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] was signed, establishing [[Caricom]], the Caribbean Community and Common Market, in 1973.\n\n==Activities and Places of Interest==\n\n===Dry forests===\nThe Chaguaramas Peninsula supports one of the few remaining areas of [[Trinidad and Tobago dry forests|dry forest]] in western Trinidad.\n\n=== Cycling and kayaking===\nOn weekends groups of persons enter Chaguaramas to cycle on or kayak <ref>Discover TT http://www.discover-tt.net/marinas/kayaking.html</ref> in rented equipment. During the week, the roadway is used as a training ground for persons who cycle <ref>Trini Outdoors http://www.trinoutdoors.com/pages/trinidad_cycling_areas.htm</ref> in groups either for sport or as a part of a training session for a Tri-athalon.  Mountain biking has grown in popularity and an extensive trail network has been developed in Tucker Valley.  These trails are created and maintained by the local Mountain Bike community.\n\n===The Chaguaramas Boardwalk Area===\nThe Chaguaramas Boardwalk was developed by the Chaguaramas Development Authority (CDA)<ref>CDA http://chaguaramas.com/</ref> as part of its tourism developmental thrust. The Boardwalk stretches for approximately 1300 feet <ref>Business Guardian http://www.guardian.co.tt/business-guardian/2012-03-29/under-chaguaramas-boardwalk</ref> along the shore of one of the Bays. The Boardwalk can be used as an exercise route for pedestrians or for young families who stroll or as a stepping stone to get to the water to swim for leisure or as part of a training regimen.\n\nAvailable in close proximity to the Boardwalk are Gazebos and Pedal Boats which are available for rent.  There is also the Dancing Water Fountain, the Trees Vendor Plaza and Miniature Off Road Activities according to the CDA's website.<ref>CDA Things to Do http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/boardwalk</ref>\n\n===Chaguaramas Golf Course===\nThe Chaguaramas Golf Course is \"a 9-hole course\" and the only \"public\" golf course in the twin-island Republic. The Golf Course at Chaguaramas has been in existence for some forty plus (40+) years and is one of the older, if not the oldest golf course in the island.<ref>CDA Golf Course http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/golf-course</ref>\n\n===Pier 1===\nPier 1 was designed to host functions for large numbers of persons. The venue was designed to host events in small areas within a larger setting, thus it can serve a large number of persons with different tastes through the use of the smaller areas as niche spots.<ref>http://www.discovertnt.com/articles/Trinidad/Touring-Trinidad-pt-4-the-Northwest-Peninsula/167/3/23#axzz4BEltV7t3</ref>\n\n===Yacht===\nChaguaramas has been the center of yachting activity in Trinidad. There are several marinas <ref>Carnaval.Com Trinidad Chag http://www.carnaval.com/trinidad/chag/</ref> within the Chaguaramas area which provide repair services or on-land boarding services for yachts. There is also the option to refuel and stock supplies or just moor the yacht at a pier or in a sheltered bay facility and visit the island.\n\n===Heritage Parks, Macqueripe and The Magnificent Edith Falls===\nAccording to the CDA, the Gasparee Cave on Gasparee Island,<ref>Perceptions - Sea visible on the Way to the Gasparee Caves, Trinidad and Tobago http://jennifernbailey245.blogspot.com/2015/09/perceptions.html</ref> along with the Salt Pond on Chacachacare and the Bellerand Heritage Park fall within the boundaries of Chaguaramas.<ref>Chaguaramas Info http://chaguaramas.com/about-cda/chag-info#in-chaguaramas</ref> Although Gasparee has been developed with housing facilities, to a large extent efforts have been made to preserve the birds on the island, through the \"upkeep\" of the large trees which provide shelter at great heights for them.\n\n\"Conveniently located just off the Macqueripe Road, Bellerand Heritage Park is surrounded by various areas offering recreational activities such as golfing, swimming and is a 'stone's throw' away from the Magnificent Edith Falls\".<ref>CDA http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/heritage-parks</ref> Another heritage park which is located within the Macqueripe area in Chaguaramas is Samaan Park.\n\nAt Macqueripe, one is allowed to swim in the sea as the area is located in an inlet. However great care should be exercised in entering and exiting the water as due to dredging of the sea bed many years ago, there is a sharp descent of several feet close to the shore. The drop/ or descent can make the area perilous for newly trained swimmers and the extremely short person entering or exiting the water.\n\n===Tucker Valley===\nTucker Valley is known for several points of interest such as: The Bamboo Cathedral, <ref>http://www.trinoutdoors.com/pages/trinidad_cycling_areas.htm,</ref>, The  UPick Farm and Restaurant, The World War Bunker, and The Nutmeg Grove <ref>Trin Tours http://www.trintours.com/cruisetrinidad.htm</ref> among other things.\n\nThe Bamboo Cathedral is well known by photographers who capture images of many newly engaged couples strolling in the area. The wide lane of the roadway with the bamboos intertwining overhead creates an image of seclusion and sets the tone for newly engaged wonder!\n\nThe UPick Farm \"sells a wide range of  fruits and vegetables (grown off-site) both local and imported\".<ref>Trini Chow https://trinichow.com/2015/12/30/u-pick-farm-chaguaramas-trinidad/</ref> Also available at the UPick Farm are guided tours and field trips for primary and secondary school children.\n\n===DockSide Facilities===\nThe Chaguaramas area also contains some dockside facilities, mostly for the transfer of [[bauxite]] ore between ship and shore, or from smaller boats to ocean-going vessels. The function of such docks is easily recognizable as the docks and buildings are colored pink from the bauxite dust.\n\n===Hunting and Fising===\nAfter the Trinidad and Tobago government passed the Conservation and Wildlife Act in 1960, hunting is strictly prohibited. This law is upheld by the Chaguaramas Development Authority. Chaguaramas is however one of the country's most popular spots for [[Tarpon]] fishing. In 2010, Sportsfishing Magazine names Chaguaramas waters one of their top locations for fishing Tarpon. <ref>http://chaguaramas.com/things-to-do/hunting-and-fishing</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Williams Bay Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|Looking West across Williams Bay during Dragon Boat racing in Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago\nFile:Chaguaramas Trinidad Drydock.jpg|A [[Drydock]] in Chaguaramas\nFile:Bamboo Cathedral Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|The \"Bamboo Cathedral\" on the road to the Tracking Station in Chaguaramas\nFile:Chaguaramas Trinidad.jpg|A warehouse harbour in Chaguaramas\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\nTransatlantic Sketches, Comprising Visits to the Most Scenes in North and South, by Sir Richard Alexander.

It has a [[cuticle]] (a tough outer covering, as an [[exoskeleton]]), four main [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermal]] cords, and a fluid-filled [[pseudocoelom]] (body cavity). It also has some of the same organ systems as larger animals. About one in a thousand individuals is male and the rest are hermaphrodites.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | year = 2007 | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = 5th | page = 1321 | publisher = [[Garland Science]] | isbn = 978-0-8153-4105-5 }}</ref> The basic anatomy of ''C. elegans'' includes a mouth, [[pharynx]], [[intestine]], [[gonad]], and [[collagen]]ous cuticle.  Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another.  When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.\n\nIn relation to lipid metabolism, ''C. elegans'' does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a [[pancreas]], a [[liver]], or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals. Neutral lipids are instead stored in the intestine, epidermis, and embryos. The [[epidermis]] corresponds to the mammalian adipocytes by being the main [[triglyceride]] depot.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemieux GA, Ashrafi K | title = Investigating Connections between Metabolism, Longevity, and Behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 586\u2013596 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27289335 | pmc = 4958586 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2016.05.004 }}</ref>\n\nThe pharynx is a muscular food pump in the head of ''C. elegans'', which is triangular in cross-section. This grinds food and transports it directly to the intestine. A set of \"valve cells\" connects the pharynx to the intestine, but how this valve operates is not understood. After digestion, the contents of the intestine are released via the rectum, as is the case with all other nematodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_organformation/organformation.html|title=The ''C. elegans'' pharynx: a model for organogenesis|website=www.wormbook.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref> No direct connection exists between the pharynx and the [[excretion|excretory]] canal, which functions in the release of liquid urine.\n\nMales have a single-lobed gonad, a [[vas deferens]], and a tail specialized for mating, which incorporates [[spicule (nematode)|spicules]]. Hermaphrodites have two [[ovaries]], [[oviducts]], and [[spermatheca]], and a single [[uterus]]. \n[[File:C elegans male.svg|thumb|right|Anatomical diagram of a male ''C. elegans'']]\n\n=== Microanatomy - gut granules ===\nNumerous gut granules are present in the intestine of ''C. elegans'', the functions of which are still not fully known, as are many other aspects of this nematode, despite the many years that it has been studied. These gut granules are found in all of the Rhabditida orders. They are very similar to [[lysosomes]] in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for [[endocytosis]], but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.\nA remarkable feature of the granules is that when they are observed under [[ultraviolet light]], they react by emitting an intense blue [[fluorescence]]. Another phenomenon seen is termed 'death fluorescence'. As the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. This death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age. Many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. They are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. Recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a [[glycosylated]] form of [[anthranilic acid]] (AA). The need for the large amounts of AA the many gut granules contain is questioned. One possibility is that the AA is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. Another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of AA fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging UV light to relatively harmless visible light. This is seen a possible link to the [[melanin]]\u2013containing [[melanosomes]].<ref>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Coburn C, Gems D | title = The mysterious case of the ''C. elegans'' gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 151 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23967012 | pmc = 3735983 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00151 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite adult-en.svg|thumb|right|A lateral (left) side anatomical diagram of an adult-stage ''C. elegans'' hermaphrodite]]\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\nThe hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its [[Somatic cell|soma]] is female.

Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another.  When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.\n\nIn relation to lipid metabolism, ''C. elegans'' does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a [[pancreas]], a [[liver]], or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals.

These gut granules are found in all of the Rhabditida orders. They are very similar to [[lysosomes]] in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for [[endocytosis]], but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.\nA remarkable feature of the granules is that when they are observed under [[ultraviolet light]], they react by emitting an intense blue [[fluorescence]]. Another phenomenon seen is termed 'death fluorescence'. As the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. This death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age. Many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. They are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. Recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a [[glycosylated]] form of [[anthranilic acid]] (AA). The need for the large amounts of AA the many gut granules contain is questioned. One possibility is that the AA is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. Another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of AA fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging UV light to relatively harmless visible light. This is seen a possible link to the [[melanin]]\u2013containing [[melanosomes]].<ref>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Coburn C, Gems D | title = The mysterious case of the ''C. elegans'' gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 151 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23967012 | pmc = 3735983 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00151 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite adult-en.svg|thumb|right|A lateral (left) side anatomical diagram of an adult-stage ''C. elegans'' hermaphrodite]]\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\nThe hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its [[Somatic cell|soma]] is female.

The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:<ref>{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher=Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gravitationcosmo00stev_0/page/17 17] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gravitationcosmo00stev_0/page/17 }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nYou are standing in a field looking at the stars.

Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?\n</blockquote>\n\nMach's principle says that this is not a coincidence\u2014that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like \"[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here\". A very general statement of Mach's principle is \"local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe\".<ref name=Hawking>{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time |author1=Stephen W.

Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111\u2013117, 1710.</ref> The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedl\u00e4nder]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Einstein's use of the principle ==\nThere is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.\n\nIn Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:<ref>{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |url= https://archive.org/details/sciencemechanic00machgoog |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub.

Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}\n\nIn this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.\n\nThe writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was \"The Science of Mechanics\", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called \"Newton's [[bucket argument]]\".\n\nIn his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.\n\nMach, in his book, says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and \"absolute\" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.\n\nThis same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere \"redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=|first=|title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity|date=1995|publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user]]|year=|isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7|editor-last=Julian B. Barbour|series=Volume 6 of Einstein Studies|location=Boston|pages=|editor-last2=Herbert Pfister}}</ref>  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.\n\nMost physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|9\u201357}} Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].\n\n== Mach's principle in general relativity ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nBecause intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by \"Mach's principle\" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|530}}  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.\n\nEinstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense\u2013Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:\n{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).<ref name=Einstein/>}}\n\nThe Lense\u2013Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that \"matter there influences inertia here\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense\u2013Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of \"Mach principles\" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).</ref>  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that \"inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies\", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.\n\nMore fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as \"the fixed stars\".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.\n\nA stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler\u2013Mach\u2013Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space|compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where \"a particular moment in the universe\" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|188\u2013207}}\n\nThere have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in T\u00fcbingen in 1993, when asked the question \"Is general relativity perfectly Machian?\", 3 respondents replied \"yes\", and 22 replied \"no\".  To the question \"Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?\" the result was 14 \"yes\" and 7 \"no\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nHowever, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:\n{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:\n# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.\n# The principle of equivalence.\n# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): \u2026 that the ''g<sub>\u00b5\u03bd</sub>'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T<sub>\u00b5\u03bd</sub>''. \nIn 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, \n\"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however.\"\n\nIt must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther.

Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?\n</blockquote>\n\nMach's principle says that this is not a coincidence\u2014that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like \"[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here\". A very general statement of Mach's principle is \"local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe\".<ref name=Hawking>{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time |author1=Stephen W.

Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite book | author=G.

(1896) by [[Benedict Friedl\u00e4nder]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Einstein's use of the principle ==\nThere is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.\n\nIn Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:<ref>{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |url= https://archive.org/details/sciencemechanic00machgoog |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub.

There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:<ref name=Einstein>A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}\n\nIn this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.\n\nThe writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was \"The Science of Mechanics\", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called \"Newton's [[bucket argument]]\".\n\nIn his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.\n\nMach, in his book, says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and \"absolute\" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.\n\nThis same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere \"redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=|first=|title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity|date=1995|publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user]]|year=|isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7|editor-last=Julian B.

It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|9\u201357}} Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].\n\n== Mach's principle in general relativity ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nBecause intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by \"Mach's principle\" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|530}}  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.\n\nEinstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense\u2013Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:\n{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).<ref name=Einstein/>}}\n\nThe Lense\u2013Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that \"matter there influences inertia here\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense\u2013Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of \"Mach principles\" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).</ref>  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that \"inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies\", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.\n\nMore fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as \"the fixed stars\".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.\n\nA stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler\u2013Mach\u2013Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space|compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where \"a particular moment in the universe\" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|188\u2013207}}\n\nThere have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in T\u00fcbingen in 1993, when asked the question \"Is general relativity perfectly Machian?\", 3 respondents replied \"yes\", and 22 replied \"no\".  To the question \"Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?\" the result was 14 \"yes\" and 7 \"no\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nHowever, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:\n{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:\n# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.\n# The principle of equivalence.\n# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): \u2026 that the ''g<sub>\u00b5\u03bd</sub>'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T<sub>\u00b5\u03bd</sub>''. \nIn 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, \n\"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however.\"\n\nIt must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther.

Many Orthodox Jews use the term \u201creligious\u201d to refer to [[Torah Judaism|a strict adherence to Jewish law]]. For the purposes of this article, \u201creligious\u201d refers to the content and context of the music itself: liturgical or implicit references to the divine.\n\nJewish ethnomusicologist Mark Kligman notes, \u201cThe scope of contemporary Jewish music encompasses a wide range of genres and styles, including music for the synagogue, folk and popular music on religious themes, Yiddish songs, klezmer music, Israeli music, and art music by serious composers. Every sector of the Jewish community \u2013 from the most right-wing Orthodox to the most secular \u2013 participates in the Jewish music endeavor, creating, performing, and listening to the particular music that meets its taste and needs.\u201d<ref name=\"kligman\">Kligman.</ref>\n\nThe question of what is Jewish music and what makes music Jewish continues to be explored in academic and artistic circles alike. It may be seen in the work of [[Velvel Pasternak]], who has spent much of the late twentieth century as a preservationist committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper.  Also, [[John Zorn|John Zorn's]] record label, [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], features a \"Radical Jewish Culture\" series that focuses on exploring what contemporary Jewish music is and what it offers to contemporary [[Jewish culture]].\n\n==History and influence==\n\n===Hasidic influence===\nWithin the [[Orthodox judaism|traditional Jewish]] community, [[nigun|cantoral and chasiddic melodies]] were the musical standard.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s recordings began to be made of noncantorial Jewish music, beginning with [[Ben Zion Shenker]]'s recording of the music of the [[Modzitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Modzitz]] chassidic sect <ref name=\"kligman-96\">Kligman, p. 96.</ref> and Cantor [[David Werdyger]]'s Gerrer recordings.  The annual Israeli Hasidic Song Festival, first held in 1969, became a stage which saw the premi\u00e8res of pieces like [[Nurit Hirsh|Nurit Hirsh's]] ''Oseh Shalom;'' [[Svika Pick|Tzvika Pik's]] ''Sh\u2019ma Yisrael;'' and [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach's]] ''Od Yishama'' and ''V\u2019ha\u2019eir Eineinu.''<ref name=\"kligman\"/>\n\n===Israeli influence===\nWith the founding of [[Israel|the State of Israel]] in 1948, American Jews showed increasing interest in Israeli music. This trend dramatically accelerated with the [[Six-Day War]]. \u201cThe practice of singing Israeli songs in American synagogues, camps, and at social gatherings, which spread in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s as young American Jews looked to Israel as a positive model for Jewish identity, and the songs\u2019 popularity also served as a Jewishly unifying factor.\u201d<ref name=\"kligman\"/>\n\nAn additional influence was in the pronunciation of Hebrew both in worship and song.  The Reform Movement, which previously had used [[Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation|Ashkenazic pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (reflecting a German-Polish tradition), switched to [[Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation|Sephardic pronunciation]] (reflecting the way Israelis spoke).<ref name=\"schiller\"/>\n\n===Folk music influence===\nLargely influenced by the folk music revival of the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, a new genre of worship music grew out of the Reform summer camp movement.  From almost the beginning of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] worship, the music centered around the use of organ and choir.<ref name=\"schiller\">Schiller.</ref>  Rather than the paradigm of organ and choir, the new music was composed for acoustic guitar and group singing.\u201d<ref name=\"dreyfus\">Dreyfus.</ref> This new style focused on making the music \"simpler, thoroughly democratic in its singability, largely Hebrew, and playable on guitar.\"<ref name=\"schiller\"/>\n\nThis influence is also clear in the music of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].  Carlebach gained fame for bridging between the folk world and the traditional Jewish Hasidic tunes.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Reinventing Hasidic Music: Shlomo Carlebach\n|author = Marsha Bryan Edelman\n|publisher = MyJewishLearning.com\n|year = 2003\n|url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/TOSynagogueMusic/Hasidic_Carlebach.htm\n|accessdate = 2007-02-06\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215194801/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/TOSynagogueMusic/Hasidic_Carlebach.htm\n|archive-date = 2006-12-15\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Rock influence===\n{{main|Jewish rock}}\nAt the same time as the folk revival made waves in Jewish worship, established composers like [[Gershon Kingsley]] and [[Ray Smolover]] utilized contemporary genres like jazz and rock in their compositions.<ref name=\"schiller\"/> As in the broader world, the influence of rock music was debated and still is in some circles.  Influence of the rock world came to the Orthodox world with bands like the [[Diaspora Yeshiva Band]], founded in 1975 by American-born student-musicians at the [[Diaspora Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem.<ref>Besser, Yisroel. \"We All Get Another Chance\". ''[[Mishpacha]]'', March 12, 2014, pp. 48-58.</ref> The founding members were Avraham Rosenblum on guitar, [[Ben Zion Solomon]] on fiddle and banjo, Simcha Abramson on saxophone and clarinet, Ruby Harris on violin, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica, [[Adam Wexler]] on bass, and Gedalia Goldstein on drums; other student-musicians also played with the group between 1973 and 1986.<ref name=\"Diaspora\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/114mag/band/band.htm|title=The Diaspora Yeshiva Band's impact on Jewish Music |last=Harris|first=Ruby|publisher=Jewish Magazine|accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> The Diaspora Yeshiva Band infused [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called \"Hasidic rock\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSO7AAAAIAAJ&q=diaspora+yeshiva+band|title=Israel, a travel survival kit|first=Neil|last=Tilbury|year=1989|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 0864420153|p=193}}</ref> or \"Country and Eastern\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.diasporaband.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Diaspora Yeshiva Band|year=2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/13320/a-jewish-pop-band-worth-the-wait-/|title=A Jewish Pop Band Worth the Wait|first=Alexander|last=Gelfand|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at [[David's Tomb]]. It inspired later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], Even Sh'siyah, [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]].\n\nPeriodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the [[reggae]] artist [[Matisyahu (musician)|Matisyahu]] being the most recent example. The 2007 Grammy Awards were a landmark in Jewish music, as the [[The Klezmatics|Klezmatics]] (a [[klezmer]]/[[folk music|folk group]]) became the first Jewish band to win a Grammy. Their music combines lyrics by [[Woody Guthrie]], the famous American lyricist, with classical klezmer tunes.\n\n===Important figures===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n* [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] is considered by many to be the most influential Jewish songwriter of the last half century.\n* [[Michael Isaacson]] grew up in [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] summer camps and was the primary innovator in Jewish camp music. He has since established himself as a prominent composer of synagogue music.\n* [[Tofa'ah]], founded in 1981, was the first all-women Jewish rock/jazz band. It sets traditional religious Jewish texts to its own compositions, as well as composes original Jewish inspirational songs. The band is unique in that it adheres strictly to the Jewish laws of [[kol isha]] and performs only for female audiences.  Its work is featured in the archives of [[Hebrew University]] and the [[Rubin Academy of Music and Dance]].\n* [[Debbie Friedman]], another product of Reform Jewish summer camps, was the first woman to set religious Jewish texts in the [[American folk music revival|American folk genre]], rendering them easily accessible and popular across the denominations. Her settings of the prayers for the [[Havdalah]] ceremony and the \"[[Yishtabach|Mi Shebeirach]]\" prayer are ubiquitous in virtually every Jewish community. [[Julie Silver]] and Rabbi Shefa Gold have both followed in Debbie Friedman's footsteps as prolific female composers of contemporary Jewish religious music in their own right.\n* Kol B'Seder, consisting of Cantor [[Jeff Klepper]] and Rabbi Daniel Freelander, also arose out of the Reform Jewish camp movement as one of the pioneering groups devoted to composing and fostering what is sometimes called \u201cAmerican [[Nusach]]: \"the late 20th century refashioning of liberal Jewish worship to reflect the attitudes and beliefs of life in North America\". Some of their well-known settings include \"[[Modeh Ani]]\", \"Or Zarua\",<!-- [[Or Zarua]] is not correct target --> and \"[[Shalom Rav]]\".\n* [[Craig Taubman]] grew up in [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] camps and has also contributed a great deal of music to the genre, such as his settings of \"[[L'cha Dodi]]\" and \"[[Hashkiveinu]]\".\n* [[Safam]], a six-man band founded in Boston in 1973, prides itself on a \"Jewish-American Sound:\" a wide breadth of American musical styles while maintaining a decidedly Jewish flavor. One of the group's founders, Robert Solomon, is a prominent cantor and composer in his own right.\n\n==Modern trends==\n\n===Trends in the Orthodox community===\nIn recent years, the time lag in style between the broad music world and its adoption by the Jewish music world had been decreasing.  Many groups and singers have released albums with noticeable influences from contemporary pop, rock music, etc. This is partly a result of a new wave of young Jewish musicians arriving out of [[yeshiva]]s and universities. Examples of this trend include The Chevra with clear pop-boy band overtones and dance moves and [[Blue Fringe]] with its extended jam sessions echoing [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]].  Other examples include acts such as [[Chaim-Dovid Saracik|Chaim Dovid]] or [[Shlomo Katz]] who echo Shlomo Carlebach's musical style.\n\nOne type of music that is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners usually consists of a formulaic mix including [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[French horn|horns]] and [[String instrument|strings]]. These songs are often a joint effort by a composer and an arranger with the singer having little to no input{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students who perform in dress suits. Many have day jobs or are studying in [[kollel]] and sideline singing at [[Jewish wedding]]s. Musical background and training varies from no formal training to very high levels (though rarely academic).\n\nLyrics are most commonly short passages in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Torah]] or the [[siddur]], with the occasional passage from the [[Talmud]]. Sometimes songs with original lyrics compiled in English, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] deal with central themes such as [[Jerusalem]], the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Judaism|Jewish identity]], and the [[Jewish diaspora]].\n\nAs a solution to the [[kol isha|Jewish law against men hearing women singing]], Jewish boys choirs became popular in the 1970s. Among the more notable of these groups are Pirchei London, the Toronto Boys Choir, the [[Miami Boys Choir]], and the Yeshiva Boys Choir. Currently the Miami Boys Choir led by Yerachmiel Begun is perhaps the most popular, with a number of albums amongst the top record sales in Orthodox Jewish circles. In addition, some female Orthodox musicians, including singers like [[Julia Blum]], [[Kineret (singer)|Kineret]], and [[Ruthi Navon]] and groups such as [[Tofa'ah]], [[Ashira (band)|Ashira]], and [[Bulletproof Stockings]], have found success performing for women only.<ref name=\"Kligman-27\">Kligman, p. 27.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Roslyn Dickens|title=A Melody of Their Own: Orthodox Women and the Performing Arts|url=http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/fall67/38-43.pdf|website=[[Jewish Action]]|publisher=[[Orthodox Union]]|date=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=John Shepherd|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volumes 3-7|date=2005|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5RUKAQAAMAAJ&dq=kineret+cohen+jewish+singer&q=kineret|isbn=9780826474360}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Matisyahu, some well-known Orthodox contemporary Jewish musicians include [[Yossi Green]], Martin Davidson, and [[Abie Rotenberg]]; well-known producers and arrangers  of this type of music are Yisroel Lamm, [[Ian Freitor]], [[Daniel Kapler]], [[Eli Leshinsky]].  Popular artists include [[Mordechai ben David|Mordechai Ben David]], [[Avraham Fried]], [[Benny Friedman (singer)|Benny Friedman]], [[Lipa Schmeltzer]], [[Shloime Dachs]], [[Dedi Graucher]], Simcha Leiner, Mordechai Shapiro, [[Beri Weber]], Shmueli Ungar, [[Motty Steinmetz]] and [[Yaakov Shwekey]].\n\n===Trends in the Reform and Conservative communities===\nThe Reform Jewish summer camps continue to be a source of contemporary Jewish worship music, where artists like [[Craig Taubman]],<ref>Brown.</ref> [[Dan Nichols]],<ref>Charlotte Observer, July 6, 1994.</ref> [[Rick Recht]],<ref>Daniels.</ref> Josh Nelson,<ref name=\"URJ\">[[Union for Reform Judaism]], Wikipedia.</ref> Alan Goodis and others have shared their newest compositions with the latest generation of campers. Nichols and Recht are among the leading Jewish rock singers of the present day and remain extremely popular among Jewish summer campers.  [[Sam Glaser]], Sue Horowitz, Noam Katz, Beth Schafer, [[Julie Silver]], Peri Smilow and others have contributed significantly to modern Reform Jewish music and have been included in ''[[Ruach]]'', the biennial music compilation produced by the Union for Reform Judaism.<ref name=\"URJ\" />\n\n===Children's music===\nA large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. [[Country Yossi]], [[Abie Rotenberg]], [[Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men|Uncle Moishy]], and the producers of the [[613 Torah Avenue]] series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Jewish traditions.  Parallel performers exist in Israel with the lyric in Hebrew or Yiddish.\n\nIn the Reform and Conservative communities, there has been a body of contemporary children's music written in the last 20 years. Children's music tends to focus on teaching Jewish values and ethics, Hebrew alef-bet and vocabulary, and teaching about the holidays. Though well-known Jewish songwriters like Debbie Friedman and Craig Taubman have written many children's songs, there are some who focus almost exclusively on this genre, like [http://www.peterandellen.com Peter and Ellen Allard] and Shira Kline.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2009/10/16/news/local/doc4ad7375f5717f641977449.txt Brown, Ellen. \"The Soundtrack of Your Life.\" Cleveland Jewish News.

This trend dramatically accelerated with the [[Six-Day War]]. \u201cThe practice of singing Israeli songs in American synagogues, camps, and at social gatherings, which spread in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s as young American Jews looked to Israel as a positive model for Jewish identity, and the songs\u2019 popularity also served as a Jewishly unifying factor.\u201d<ref name=\"kligman\"/>\n\nAn additional influence was in the pronunciation of Hebrew both in worship and song.  The Reform Movement, which previously had used [[Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation|Ashkenazic pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (reflecting a German-Polish tradition), switched to [[Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation|Sephardic pronunciation]] (reflecting the way Israelis spoke).<ref name=\"schiller\"/>\n\n===Folk music influence===\nLargely influenced by the folk music revival of the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, a new genre of worship music grew out of the Reform summer camp movement.  From almost the beginning of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] worship, the music centered around the use of organ and choir.<ref name=\"schiller\">Schiller.</ref>  Rather than the paradigm of organ and choir, the new music was composed for acoustic guitar and group singing.\u201d<ref name=\"dreyfus\">Dreyfus.</ref> This new style focused on making the music \"simpler, thoroughly democratic in its singability, largely Hebrew, and playable on guitar.\"<ref name=\"schiller\"/>\n\nThis influence is also clear in the music of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].  Carlebach gained fame for bridging between the folk world and the traditional Jewish Hasidic tunes.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Reinventing Hasidic Music: Shlomo Carlebach\n|author = Marsha Bryan Edelman\n|publisher = MyJewishLearning.com\n|year = 2003\n|url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/TOSynagogueMusic/Hasidic_Carlebach.htm\n|accessdate = 2007-02-06\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215194801/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/TOSynagogueMusic/Hasidic_Carlebach.htm\n|archive-date = 2006-12-15\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Rock influence===\n{{main|Jewish rock}}\nAt the same time as the folk revival made waves in Jewish worship, established composers like [[Gershon Kingsley]] and [[Ray Smolover]] utilized contemporary genres like jazz and rock in their compositions.<ref name=\"schiller\"/> As in the broader world, the influence of rock music was debated and still is in some circles.  Influence of the rock world came to the Orthodox world with bands like the [[Diaspora Yeshiva Band]], founded in 1975 by American-born student-musicians at the [[Diaspora Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem.<ref>Besser, Yisroel. \"We All Get Another Chance\". ''[[Mishpacha]]'', March 12, 2014, pp. 48-58.</ref> The founding members were Avraham Rosenblum on guitar, [[Ben Zion Solomon]] on fiddle and banjo, Simcha Abramson on saxophone and clarinet, Ruby Harris on violin, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica, [[Adam Wexler]] on bass, and Gedalia Goldstein on drums; other student-musicians also played with the group between 1973 and 1986.<ref name=\"Diaspora\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/114mag/band/band.htm|title=The Diaspora Yeshiva Band's impact on Jewish Music |last=Harris|first=Ruby|publisher=Jewish Magazine|accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> The Diaspora Yeshiva Band infused [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called \"Hasidic rock\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSO7AAAAIAAJ&q=diaspora+yeshiva+band|title=Israel, a travel survival kit|first=Neil|last=Tilbury|year=1989|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 0864420153|p=193}}</ref> or \"Country and Eastern\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.diasporaband.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Diaspora Yeshiva Band|year=2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/13320/a-jewish-pop-band-worth-the-wait-/|title=A Jewish Pop Band Worth the Wait|first=Alexander|last=Gelfand|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at [[David's Tomb]]. It inspired later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], Even Sh'siyah, [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]].\n\nPeriodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the [[reggae]] artist [[Matisyahu (musician)|Matisyahu]] being the most recent example. The 2007 Grammy Awards were a landmark in Jewish music, as the [[The Klezmatics|Klezmatics]] (a [[klezmer]]/[[folk music|folk group]]) became the first Jewish band to win a Grammy. Their music combines lyrics by [[Woody Guthrie]], the famous American lyricist, with classical klezmer tunes.\n\n===Important figures===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n* [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] is considered by many to be the most influential Jewish songwriter of the last half century.\n* [[Michael Isaacson]] grew up in [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] summer camps and was the primary innovator in Jewish camp music. He has since established himself as a prominent composer of synagogue music.\n* [[Tofa'ah]], founded in 1981, was the first all-women Jewish rock/jazz band. It sets traditional religious Jewish texts to its own compositions, as well as composes original Jewish inspirational songs. The band is unique in that it adheres strictly to the Jewish laws of [[kol isha]] and performs only for female audiences.  Its work is featured in the archives of [[Hebrew University]] and the [[Rubin Academy of Music and Dance]].\n* [[Debbie Friedman]], another product of Reform Jewish summer camps, was the first woman to set religious Jewish texts in the [[American folk music revival|American folk genre]], rendering them easily accessible and popular across the denominations. Her settings of the prayers for the [[Havdalah]] ceremony and the \"[[Yishtabach|Mi Shebeirach]]\" prayer are ubiquitous in virtually every Jewish community. [[Julie Silver]] and Rabbi Shefa Gold have both followed in Debbie Friedman's footsteps as prolific female composers of contemporary Jewish religious music in their own right.\n* Kol B'Seder, consisting of Cantor [[Jeff Klepper]] and Rabbi Daniel Freelander, also arose out of the Reform Jewish camp movement as one of the pioneering groups devoted to composing and fostering what is sometimes called \u201cAmerican [[Nusach]]: \"the late 20th century refashioning of liberal Jewish worship to reflect the attitudes and beliefs of life in North America\". Some of their well-known settings include \"[[Modeh Ani]]\", \"Or Zarua\",<!-- [[Or Zarua]] is not correct target --> and \"[[Shalom Rav]]\".\n* [[Craig Taubman]] grew up in [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] camps and has also contributed a great deal of music to the genre, such as his settings of \"[[L'cha Dodi]]\" and \"[[Hashkiveinu]]\".\n* [[Safam]], a six-man band founded in Boston in 1973, prides itself on a \"Jewish-American Sound:\" a wide breadth of American musical styles while maintaining a decidedly Jewish flavor. One of the group's founders, Robert Solomon, is a prominent cantor and composer in his own right.\n\n==Modern trends==\n\n===Trends in the Orthodox community===\nIn recent years, the time lag in style between the broad music world and its adoption by the Jewish music world had been decreasing.  Many groups and singers have released albums with noticeable influences from contemporary pop, rock music, etc. This is partly a result of a new wave of young Jewish musicians arriving out of [[yeshiva]]s and universities. Examples of this trend include The Chevra with clear pop-boy band overtones and dance moves and [[Blue Fringe]] with its extended jam sessions echoing [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]].  Other examples include acts such as [[Chaim-Dovid Saracik|Chaim Dovid]] or [[Shlomo Katz]] who echo Shlomo Carlebach's musical style.\n\nOne type of music that is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners usually consists of a formulaic mix including [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[French horn|horns]] and [[String instrument|strings]]. These songs are often a joint effort by a composer and an arranger with the singer having little to no input{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students who perform in dress suits. Many have day jobs or are studying in [[kollel]] and sideline singing at [[Jewish wedding]]s. Musical background and training varies from no formal training to very high levels (though rarely academic).\n\nLyrics are most commonly short passages in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Torah]] or the [[siddur]], with the occasional passage from the [[Talmud]]. Sometimes songs with original lyrics compiled in English, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] deal with central themes such as [[Jerusalem]], the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Judaism|Jewish identity]], and the [[Jewish diaspora]].\n\nAs a solution to the [[kol isha|Jewish law against men hearing women singing]], Jewish boys choirs became popular in the 1970s. Among the more notable of these groups are Pirchei London, the Toronto Boys Choir, the [[Miami Boys Choir]], and the Yeshiva Boys Choir. Currently the Miami Boys Choir led by Yerachmiel Begun is perhaps the most popular, with a number of albums amongst the top record sales in Orthodox Jewish circles. In addition, some female Orthodox musicians, including singers like [[Julia Blum]], [[Kineret (singer)|Kineret]], and [[Ruthi Navon]] and groups such as [[Tofa'ah]], [[Ashira (band)|Ashira]], and [[Bulletproof Stockings]], have found success performing for women only.<ref name=\"Kligman-27\">Kligman, p. 27.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Roslyn Dickens|title=A Melody of Their Own: Orthodox Women and the Performing Arts|url=http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/fall67/38-43.pdf|website=[[Jewish Action]]|publisher=[[Orthodox Union]]|date=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=John Shepherd|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volumes 3-7|date=2005|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5RUKAQAAMAAJ&dq=kineret+cohen+jewish+singer&q=kineret|isbn=9780826474360}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Matisyahu, some well-known Orthodox contemporary Jewish musicians include [[Yossi Green]], Martin Davidson, and [[Abie Rotenberg]]; well-known producers and arrangers  of this type of music are Yisroel Lamm, [[Ian Freitor]], [[Daniel Kapler]], [[Eli Leshinsky]].  Popular artists include [[Mordechai ben David|Mordechai Ben David]], [[Avraham Fried]], [[Benny Friedman (singer)|Benny Friedman]], [[Lipa Schmeltzer]], [[Shloime Dachs]], [[Dedi Graucher]], Simcha Leiner, Mordechai Shapiro, [[Beri Weber]], Shmueli Ungar, [[Motty Steinmetz]] and [[Yaakov Shwekey]].\n\n===Trends in the Reform and Conservative communities===\nThe Reform Jewish summer camps continue to be a source of contemporary Jewish worship music, where artists like [[Craig Taubman]],<ref>Brown.</ref> [[Dan Nichols]],<ref>Charlotte Observer, July 6, 1994.</ref> [[Rick Recht]],<ref>Daniels.</ref> Josh Nelson,<ref name=\"URJ\">[[Union for Reform Judaism]], Wikipedia.</ref> Alan Goodis and others have shared their newest compositions with the latest generation of campers. Nichols and Recht are among the leading Jewish rock singers of the present day and remain extremely popular among Jewish summer campers.  [[Sam Glaser]], Sue Horowitz, Noam Katz, Beth Schafer, [[Julie Silver]], Peri Smilow and others have contributed significantly to modern Reform Jewish music and have been included in ''[[Ruach]]'', the biennial music compilation produced by the Union for Reform Judaism.<ref name=\"URJ\" />\n\n===Children's music===\nA large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. [[Country Yossi]], [[Abie Rotenberg]], [[Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men|Uncle Moishy]], and the producers of the [[613 Torah Avenue]] series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Jewish traditions.  Parallel performers exist in Israel with the lyric in Hebrew or Yiddish.\n\nIn the Reform and Conservative communities, there has been a body of contemporary children's music written in the last 20 years. Children's music tends to focus on teaching Jewish values and ethics, Hebrew alef-bet and vocabulary, and teaching about the holidays. Though well-known Jewish songwriters like Debbie Friedman and Craig Taubman have written many children's songs, there are some who focus almost exclusively on this genre, like [http://www.peterandellen.com Peter and Ellen Allard] and Shira Kline.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2009/10/16/news/local/doc4ad7375f5717f641977449.txt Brown, Ellen. \"The Soundtrack of Your Life.\" Cleveland Jewish News.
