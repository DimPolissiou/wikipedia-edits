Paper bags with handles later became the standard for department stores, and were often printed with the store's logo or brand colors.\n\n[[Plastic bag]]s were introduced in the 1970s, and thanks to their lower cost, eventually replaced paper bags as the bag of choice for grocery stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124473522987806581|title=Paper or Plastic?

An open mouth bag is a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The bag is filled through the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve bag is the cement sack.\n\n==Recycling==\n\nPaper bags are readily recyclable.

These \"Deubener Shopping Bags\" could carry up to 75 pounds at a time, and became quite popular, selling over a million bags a year by 1915. Paper bags with handles later became the standard for department stores, and were often printed with the store's logo or brand colors.\n\n[[Plastic bag]]s were introduced in the 1970s, and thanks to their lower cost, eventually replaced paper bags as the bag of choice for grocery stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124473522987806581|title=Paper or Plastic?

An open mouth bag is a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The bag is filled though the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve bag is the cement sack.\n\n==Recycling==\n\nPaper bags are readily recyclable.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

They are blind for the first 14 days, and [[weaning|weaned]] at 12 weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Dens have been observed under fallen trees and tree roots, from wherein the area outside could be easily surveyed. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]\nThe Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=iucn/>\n\nA Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a \u2018British big cat\u2019: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441\u2013448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis \u00d7 L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504\u2013508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349\u2013355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/Schwartz_et_al_conservation_genetics/Schwartz_et_al_conservation_genetics.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]].
