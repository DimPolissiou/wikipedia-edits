Initially this gave the populated areas of California's west coast a more direct route to the [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]] fields, but more importantly the trail opened up the [[Southern California]] [[Colorado Desert]] region, and beyond, to settlement and development.<ref>Johnston, pp 7-8.</ref>  \n\nAs part of the trail, and in partnership with William Warringer, on June 16, 1862, Bradshaw set up a ferry service to cross the Colorado River.  The ferry transported travelers across the river from a location called Providence Point in California, to La Paz in the New Mexico territory.<ref>Gunther, pp 407.</ref>\n\nBradshaw died in La Paz on December 2, 1864, after his throat was slashed with a [[drawknife]].<ref name=\"Block1\" />  Newspaper reports at the time stated Bradshaw had committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Private Letters from Arizona ... |agency=Petaluma Journal and Argus |volume=X |issue= 46 |page= 1 |publisher=McNabb & Cassidy |date=December 29, 1864}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=From Prescott Courier |agency=Holbrook Argus, Holbrook Arizona |volume= 1|issue= 5 |page= 4 |date=January 9, 1896}}</ref>  Given the nature of his death, and no witnesses, historians, such as Francis J.

Initially this gave the populated areas of California's west coast a more direct route to the [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]] fields, but more importantly the trail opened up the [[Southern California]] [[Colorado Desert]] region, and beyond, to settlement and development.<ref>Johnston, pp 7-8.</ref>  \n\nAs part of the trail, and in partnership with William Warringer, on June 16, 1862, Bradshaw set up a ferry service to cross the Colorado River.

Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants.

The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair.

Measures include the [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], [[protein efficiency ratio]], [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score|protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score]] and [[Complete protein|complete proteins concept]]. These concepts are important in the [[animal husbandry|livestock industry]], because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in [[fodder|animal feeds]] would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on [[feed conversion ratio]]. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n===Protein per calorie===\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).<ref>{{cite book |title=SDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |date=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |edition=Release 21}}</ref> For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the [[Daily Value]] of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal.<ref name=Broccoli>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Broccoli%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html |title=Broccoli, raw: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4&nbsp;mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Egg%2C_poached%2C_cooked%2C_whole_nutritional_value.html |title=Egg, poached, cooked, whole: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3&nbsp;kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6&nbsp;kg to get enough calories.<ref name=Broccoli/> It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10\u201335% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/protein |title=Web MD Protein: Are You Getting Enough? |publisher=webmd.com |date=2014-09-05 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Complete proteins in non-human animals==\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was [[zein]], which comes from [[maize]] (corn), but recovered if they were fed [[casein]] from cow's milk. This led [[William Cumming Rose]] to the discovery of the essential amino acid [[threonine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose WC, Haines WJ, Warner DT, Johnson JE |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kopple JD, Swendseid ME |date=May 1975 |title=Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=881\u2013891 |pmid=1123426 |pmc=301830 |doi=10.1172/JCI108016}}</ref>\n\n==Interchangeability==\nThe distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low [[serum albumin]] and low [[serum transferrin]].<ref name=\"DRI\" />\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by [[William Cumming Rose]]. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of [[Corn starch|cornstarch]], [[sucrose]], [[butterfat]] without protein, [[corn oil]], inorganic salts, the known [[vitamin]]s, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with [[peppermint oil]] (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids.
