One day, Katja drops Rocco off at Nuri's office, a small travel agency in [[Hamburg]] where he also does translation and taxes, so she can spend the afternoon with a friend. Heading out, she warns a young blonde woman leaving her new bicycle in front of the store that it will get stolen if she doesn't lock it up. When Katja returns that night, the street is blocked off. A nail bomb has gone off, injuring dozens and killing Nuri and Rocco. Katja tells the police about the woman with the bike, which had a travel compartment.\n\nThe police rule out a Jihadist motive as Nuri was neither religious nor political and initially focus on revenge by drug traffickers, though they release a composite sketch of the blonde woman. After Katja declines Nuri's parents' request to bury the bodies in Turkey, Nuri's mother coldly informs her at the funeral that her grandson would still be alive if Katja had been a better mother. Devastated, Katja uses drugs and later attempts suicide by slashing her wrists, but changes her mind and bandages them upon hearing a phone call come in (while she was bleeding) that [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] suspects have been caught.\n\nMarried couple Andr\u00e9 and Edda M\u00f6ller go on trial. Disgusted with his son, Andr\u00e9's father testifies how he found bags of nails, fertilizer, and diesel in the garage, but the defense establishes that unknown people could have gained access to the garage through a hidden key. Forensics match the bomb to the material found in the garage, which bears fingerprints from the couple and an unknown individual, who could have been a store employee but who the defense claims could have been the real culprit. Nikolaos Makris, a Greek hotel owner, claims the M\u00f6llers were staying in Greece at the time of the bombing, but it is revealed he is also a member of the far-right party [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and the M\u00f6llers liked [[Facebook]] photos of him at a rally in Germany. Katja testifies about seeing Edda outside the office but the defense calls her testimony into question by pointing out her drug use. The couple are acquitted by the court and go into hiding.\n\nKatja searches for the M\u00f6llers in Greece by finding Makris' hotel. Katja follows Makris and finds the M\u00f6llers living in an RV on the beach. She builds a nail bomb and plants it under the vehicle in a backpack, but changes her mind and retrieves it.  After a few days' contemplation, she returns to the beach and sees the M\u00f6llers enter the RV. After a few moments, she enters wearing the backpack; the vehicle explodes within seconds.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, plus four named in synopsis and all roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Katja \u015eekerci, wife of Nuri and mother of Rocco\n* [[Denis Moschitto]] as Danilo Fava, the \u015eekercis' attorney\n* [[Johannes Krisch]] as Herr Haberbeck, attorney for the M\u00f6llers\n* Samia Chancrin as Birgit, Katja's best friend\n* [[Numan Acar]] as Nuri \u015eekerci, husband of Katja and father of Rocco\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6ller, father of Andr\u00e9\n* Rafael Santana as Rocco \u015eekerci, 6-year-old son of Nuri and Katja\n* Hanna Hilsdorf as Edda M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist\n* Ulrich Friedrich Brandhoff as Andr\u00e9 M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist\n* [[Yannis Economides|Yannis Ekonomides]] as Nikolaos Makris\n\n==Production==\n\nThe terrorist attack in the film was loosely based on the events of the [[2004 Cologne bombing]], when Neo-Nazis detonated a nail bomb, also hidden above a bicycle rack, on a busy commercial street in a heavily Turkish neighborhood in [[Cologne]].

After Katja declines Nuri's parents' request to bury the bodies in Turkey, Nuri's mother coldly informs her at the funeral that her grandson would still be alive if Katja had been a better mother. Devastated, Katja uses drugs and later attempts suicide by slashing her wrists, but changes her mind and bandages them upon hearing a phone call come in (while she was bleeding) that [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] suspects have been caught.\n\nMarried couple Andr\u00e9 and Edda M\u00f6ller go on trial. Disgusted with his son, Andr\u00e9's father testifies how he found bags of nails, fertilizer, and diesel in the garage, but the defense establishes that unknown people could have gained access to the garage through a hidden key. Forensics match the bomb to the material found in the garage, which bears fingerprints from the couple and an unknown individual, who could have been a store employee but who the defense claims could have been the real culprit. Nikolaos Makris, a Greek hotel owner, claims the M\u00f6llers were staying in Greece at the time of the bombing, but it is revealed he is also a member of the far-right party [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and the M\u00f6llers liked [[Facebook]] photos of him at a rally in Germany. Katja testifies about seeing Edda outside the office but the defense calls her testimony into question by pointing out her drug use. The couple are acquitted by the court and go into hiding.\n\nKatja searches for the M\u00f6llers in Greece by finding Makris' hotel. Katja follows Makris and finds the M\u00f6llers living in an RV on the beach. She builds a nail bomb and plants it under the vehicle in a backpack, but changes her mind and retrieves it.  After a few days' contemplation, she returns to the beach and sees the M\u00f6llers enter the RV. After a few moments, she enters wearing the backpack; the vehicle explodes within seconds.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, plus four named in synopsis and all roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Katja \u015eekerci, wife of Nuri and mother of Rocco\n* [[Denis Moschitto]] as Danilo Fava, the \u015eekercis' attorney\n* [[Johannes Krisch]] as Herr Haberbeck, attorney for the M\u00f6llers\n* Samia Chancrin as Birgit, Katja's best friend\n* [[Numan Acar]] as Nuri \u015eekerci, husband of Katja and father of Rocco\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6ller, father of Andr\u00e9\n* Rafael Santana as Rocco \u015eekerci, 6-year-old son of Nuri and Katja\n* Hanna Hilsdorf as Edda M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist\n* Ulrich Friedrich Brandhoff as Andr\u00e9 M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist\n* Yannis Ekonomidis as Nikolaos Makris\n\n==Production==\n\nThe terrorist attack in the film was loosely based on the events of the [[2004 Cologne bombing]], when Neo-Nazis detonated a nail bomb, also hidden above a bicycle rack, on a busy commercial street in a heavily Turkish neighborhood in [[Cologne]].

[[Strategic bombing]] is a [[military strategy]] which is distinct from both [[close air support]] of ground forces and [[Air supremacy#World War II|tactical air power]].<ref>R.J. Overy, ''The Air War. 1939\u20131945'' (1980) pp. 8\u201314</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, it was believed by many military strategists of [[air power]] that major victories could be won by attacking industrial and political infrastructure, rather than purely military targets.<ref>Tami Davis Biddle, \"British and American Approaches to Strategic Bombing: Their Origins and Implementation in the World War II Combined Bomber Offensive\", ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1995) 18#1 pp 91\u2013144</ref> Strategic bombing often involved bombing areas inhabited by civilians and some campaigns were deliberately designed to target civilian populations in order to terrorize and disrupt their usual activities. [[International law]] at the outset of World War II did not specifically forbid aerial bombardment of cities despite the prior occurrence of such bombing during [[World War I]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nStrategic bombing during World War II began on 1 September 1939 when Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German Air Force) [[Bombing of Wielu\u0144|began bombing]] cities and the civilian population in Poland in an indiscriminate [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|aerial bombardment campaign]].<ref>Levine 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LZ99c7ZlxxQC&pg=PA21 p. 21]</ref> As the war continued to expand, bombing by both the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] increased significantly. The [[Royal Air Force]] began bombing military targets in Germany, such as [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s and [[shipyard]]s, in March 1940.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ww2today.com/the-first-bombing-raid-on-germany |title = The first bombing raid on Germany by the RAF in World War II}}</ref> In September 1940, the Luftwaffe began targeting British cities in [[the Blitz]].<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 52\"/> After the beginning of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941, the Luftwaffe [[Axis and Soviet air operations during Operation Barbarossa|attacked]] Soviet cities and infrastructure.

Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update [[international humanitarian law]] to include [[aerial warfare]], it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the [[laws of war]], but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=G\u00f3mez|first=Javier Guis\u00e1ndez|date=20 June 1998|title=The Law of Air Warfare|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=n\u00ba 323|pages=347\u201363|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1}}</ref> This means that aerial bombardment of civilian areas in enemy territory by all major belligerents during World War II was not prohibited by [[Positive international law|positive]] or specific [[Customary international law|customary]] international humanitarian law.<ref>{{cite book |title=Terror from the Sky: The Bombing of German Cities in World War II |year=2010 |page=167 |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=978-1-8454-5844-7}}</ref>\n\nMany reasons exist for the absence of international law regarding aerial bombing in World War II.<ref>Evangeslista, Matthew. \"Peace Studies, Volume 3\". page 447.

Also, the major powers' possession of newly developed advanced bombers was a great military advantage; they would be hard pressed to accept any negotiated limitations regarding this new weapon. In the absence of specific laws relating to aerial warfare, the belligerents' aerial forces at the start of World War II used the 1907 Hague Conventions \u2014 signed and ratified by most major powers \u2014 as the customary standard to govern their conduct in warfare, and these conventions were interpreted by both sides to allow the indiscriminate bombing of enemy cities throughout the war.<ref name=\"HARRIS\">{{cite book |title=Despatch on War Operations: 23rd February 1942 to 8th May 1945 |date=30 November 1995 |author=Sir Arthur Harris |page=44 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7146-4692-3}}</ref>\n\nGeneral [[Telford Taylor]], Chief Counsel for [[War Crimes]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], wrote that:\n{{quote|If the first badly bombed cities \u2014 [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]], [[Rotterdam Blitz|Rotterdam]], [[Operation Retribution (1941)|Belgrade]], and [[The Blitz|London]] \u2014 suffered at the hands of the Germans and not the Allies, nonetheless the ruins of German and Japanese cities were the results not of reprisal but of deliberate policy, and bore witness that aerial bombardment of cities and factories has become a recognized part of [[modern warfare]] as carried out by all nations.<ref name=\"HARRIS\" />}}\nArticle 25 of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on Land Warfare also did not provide a clear guideline on the extent to which civilians may be spared; the same can be held for naval forces.

Under pressure from Goering, [[Albert Kesselring]], Wever's replacement, opted for a medium, all-purpose, twin-engine tactical bomber. [[Erhard Milch]], who strongly supported Goering's conceptions, was instrumental in the Luftwaffe's future. Milch believed that the German industry (in terms of raw materials and production capacity) could only produce 1,000 four-engine heavy bombers per year, but many times that number of twin-engine bombers. In spring of 1937, just when the Luftwaffe's own Technical Office had passed the [[Junkers Ju 89|Ju-89]] and [[Dornier Do 19|Do-19]] heavy bomber models as ready for testing, Goering ordered a halt to all work on the four-engine strategic bomber program.<ref>Trigg, \"The Defeat of the Luftwaffe\" 2016, p. 52-56</ref> However, in 1939 the ''[[Bomber B]]'' program sought to produce a twin-engined strategic bomber that could carry nearly-equivalent bombloads of Allied four-engined heavy bombers, but as an advanced development of the pre-war ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' concept. The ''Bomber B'' designs meant to achieve top level speeds of at least 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph). The ''Bomber B'' program went nowhere, as the intended designs required pairs of combat-reliable aviation engines of at least 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000 PS) apiece,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} something that the German aviation engine industry had [[Bomber B#High-output engines|serious problems in developing]]. A further design program was initiated in the late spring of 1942, to develop four-engine (and later six-engine) bombers with trans-Atlantic range to attack the continental United States and aptly named the ''[[Amerika Bomber]]''. This also went nowhere, with only five prototype airframes from two design competitors getting airborne for testing, before the war's end.\n\nThe only heavy bomber design to see service with the ''Luftwaffe'' in World War II was the trouble-prone [[Heinkel He 177]]A. In the initial design of November 1937, the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] had mistakenly decided that the He 177 should also have a medium angle \"dive bombing\" capability. [[Ernst Heinkel]] and Milch vehemently disagreed with this, but the requirement was not rescinded until September 1942 by Goering himself.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 53</ref> The He 177A went into service in April 1942, despite an ongoing series of engine fires in the small batch of A-0 series production prototype aircraft. This deficiency, along with numerous, seriously deficient design features \u2014 led Goering to decry the He 177A's [[Daimler-Benz DB 606]] powerplants to be nothing more than fire-prone, cumbersome [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] in August of that year.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 52</ref> Production of the B-series by Heinkel's only subcontractor for the ''Greif'', ''[[Arado Flugzeugwerke]]'', would not have started until November 1944, because of Arado's focus on the production of its own [[Arado Ar 234]] jet-powered reconnaissance-bomber at the time.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 165</ref> The July 1944-initiated [[Emergency Fighter Program|''J\u00e4gernotprogramm'']], as well as the devastating effects of Allied bombing on the entire German aviation industry, prevented any production of the He 177B design.\n\n[[File:V-2victimAntwerp1944.jpg|thumb|right|One of the victims of a German [[V-2 rocket]] that struck Teniers Square, Antwerp, Belgium on 27 November 1944]]\n\nThe He 177A entered service in April 1942.

To ensure this, we must achieve two things: first, we must make the town physically uninhabitable and, secondly, we must make the people conscious of constant personal danger.

Should the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) be scaled back to allow more resources to go to the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] or should the strategic bombing option be followed and expanded? An influential paper was presented to support the bombing campaign by Professor [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], the British government's leading scientific adviser, justifying the use of area bombing to \"[[Dehousing|dehouse]]\" the German workforce as the most effective way of reducing their morale and affecting enemy war production.<ref>Levine 1992, p. 39.</ref>\n\n[[John Edward Singleton|Mr. Justice Singleton]], a High Court Judge, was asked by Cabinet to look into the competing points of view. In his report, delivered on 20 May 1942, he concluded:\n{{quote|If Russia can hold Germany on land I doubt whether Germany will stand 12 or 18 months' continuous, intensified and increased bombing, affecting, as it must, her war production, her power of resistance, her industries and her will to resist (by which I mean morale).<ref>Longmate 1983, p.133</ref><ref>Copp 1996.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Issues/Singletn.php |title=Issues : Singleton \u2013 World War Two |publisher=Valourandhorror.com |accessdate=1 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227151505/http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Issues/Singletn.php |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn the end, thanks in part to the dehousing paper, it was this view which prevailed and Bomber Command would remain an important component of the British war effort up to the end of World War II. A large proportion of the industrial production of the United Kingdom was harnessed to the task of creating a vast fleet of heavy bombers. Until 1944, the effect on German production was remarkably small and raised doubts whether it was wise to divert so much effort\u2014the response being there was nowhere else the effort could have been applied, as readily, to greater effect.\n\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 1945, despite being hit dozens of times by Allied bombs, the [[Cologne Cathedral]] survived the war.]]\n\nLindemann was liked and trusted by [[Winston Churchill]], who appointed him the British government's leading scientific adviser with a seat in the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. In 1942, Lindemann presented the \"[[dehousing paper]]\" to the Cabinet showing the effect that intensive bombing of German cities could produce. It was accepted by the Cabinet, and [[Arthur Travers Harris|Air Marshal Harris]] was appointed to carry out the task. It became an important part of the [[total war]] waged against Germany. Professor Lindemann's paper put forward the theory of attacking major industrial centres in order to deliberately destroy as many homes and houses as possible. Working-class homes were to be targeted because they had a higher density and fire storms were more likely. This would displace the German workforce and reduce their ability to work. His calculations (which were questioned at the time, in particular by Professor [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|P. M. S. Blackett]] of the Admiralty [[operations research]] department, expressly refuting Lindemann's conclusions)<ref>This was the sole attempt to analyse Bomber Command policy during the war. ''Ethics and Airpower''.</ref> showed the RAF's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] would be able to destroy the majority of German houses located in cities quite quickly. The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought that bombing was the only option available to directly attack Germany (as a major invasion of the continent was almost two years away), and the Soviets were demanding that the Western Allies do something to relieve the pressure on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Few in Britain opposed this policy, but there were three notable opponents in Parliament, Bishop [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]] and the Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Richard Stokes]] and [[Alfred Salter]]. No effort to examine the effects of bombing was ever made.<ref>''Ethics and Airpower''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Altstadt-Zerstoerung-Luftbild 1944.jpg|thumb|The area near the [[Frankfurt Cathedral]] after a bombing, March 1945]]\nOn 14 February 1942, the [[area bombing directive]] was issued to Bomber Command. Bombing was to be \"focused on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of the industrial workers.\" Though it was never explicitly declared, this was the nearest that the British got to a declaration of unrestricted aerial bombing \u2013 Directive 22 said \"You are accordingly authorised to use your forces without restriction\", and then listing a series of primary targets which included [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], [[Duisburg]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Cologne]]. Secondary targets included [[Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II|Braunschweig]], [[L\u00fcbeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], [[Kiel]], [[Hanover]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Mannheim]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Schweinfurt]]. The directive stated that \"operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civilian population, and in particular, the industrial workers\". Lest there be any confusion, [[Sir Charles Portal]] wrote to [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Norman Bottomley]] on 15 February \"...I suppose it is clear that the aiming points will be the built-up areas, and not, for instance, the dockyards or aircraft factories\". Factories were no longer targets.<ref>Levine 1992, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe first true practical demonstrations were on the night of 28 to 29 March 1942, when 234 aircraft [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|bombed]] the ancient [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] port of L\u00fcbeck. This target was chosen not because it was a significant military target, but because it was expected to be particularly susceptible \u2013 in Harris's words it was \"built more like a fire lighter than a city\". The ancient timber structures burned well, and the raid destroyed most of the city's centre. A few days later, Rostock suffered the same fate.\n\n[[File:Lancaster over Hamburg.jpg|thumb|An [[Avro Lancaster]] [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|over Hamburg]]]]\nAt this stage of the air war, the most effective and disruptive examples of area bombing were the \"thousand-bomber raids\". Bomber Command was able by organization and drafting in as many aircraft as possible to assemble very large forces which could then attack a single area, overwhelming the defences. The aircraft would be staggered so that they would arrive over the target in succession: the new technique of the \"[[bomber stream]]\".\n\nOn 30 May 1942, between 0047 and 0225 hours, in [[Operation Millennium]] 1,046 bombers dropped over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town of [[Cologne]], and the resulting fires burned it from end to end. The damage inflicted was extensive. The fires could be seen 600 miles away at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Some 3,300 houses were destroyed, and 10,000 were damaged. 12,000 separate fires raged destroying 36 factories, damaging 270 more, and leaving 45,000 people with nowhere to live or to work. Only 384 civilians and 85 soldiers were killed, but thousands evacuated the city. Bomber Command lost 40 bombers.\n\nTwo further thousand-bomber raids were conducted over [[Essen]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], but neither so utterly shook both sides as the scale of the destruction at Cologne and Hamburg.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The effects of the massive raids using a combination of [[blockbuster bomb]]s (to blow off roofs) and incendiaries (to start fires in the exposed buildings) created [[firestorm]]s in some cities. The most extreme examples of which were caused by [[Operation Gomorrah]], the combined USAAF/RAF [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|attack on Hamburg]], (45,000 dead), [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|attack on Kassel]] (10,000 dead), the [[Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II|attack on Darmstadt]] (12,500 dead), the [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|attack on Pforzheim]] (21,200 dead), the attack on Swinemuende (23,000 dead) and the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|attack on Dresden]] (25,000 dead).\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-025-19A, Koeln, Kinderleichen nach Luftangriff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An elderly woman in front of the bodies of school children in [[Cologne]], Germany, after a bombing raid]]\nAccording to economic historian [[Adam Tooze]], in his book ''[[The Wages of Destruction|The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy]]'', a turning point in the bomber offensive was reached in March 1943, during the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Over five months 34,000 tons of bombs were dropped. Following the raids, steel production fell by 200,000 tons, making a shortfall of 400,000 tons. Speer acknowledged that the RAF were hitting the right targets, and raids severely disrupted his plans to increase production to meet increasing attritional needs. Between July 1943 and March 1944 there were no further increases in the output of aircraft.<ref>Tooze 2002, pp. 597\u2013598.</ref>\n\nThe bombing of Hamburg in 1943 also produced impressive results. [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Attacks on Tiger I]] heavy tank production, and of that of 88mm guns, the most potent dual-purpose artillery piece in the ''Wehrmacht'', meant that output of both was \"set back for months\". On top of this, some 62 percent of the population was dehoused causing more difficulties. However, RAF Bomber Command allowed itself to be distracted by Harris' desire for a war winning blow, and attempted the fruitless missions to [[Battle of Berlin (air)|destroy Berlin]] and end the war by spring, 1944.<ref>Tooze 2002, p. 602.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wesel 1945.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Wesel]] in 1945. 97% of all buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing.]]\nIn October 1943, Harris urged the government to be honest with the public regarding the purpose of the bombing campaign. To Harris, his complete success at Hamburg confirmed the validity and necessity of his methods, and he urged that:\n\n{{quote|the aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.<ref>Denson 1999, p. 352.</ref><ref>Garret 1993, pp. 32\u201333.</ref><br />... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy.

It had immediate effects on shipments of goods, and especially coal deliveries, upon which Germany's economy depended; with no more additional effort, by February 1945, rail transport (which competed for coal) had seen its shipments cut by more than half, and by March, \"except in limited areas, the coal supply had been eliminated.\"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/ETO-Summary.html#taotraw%22 Strategic Bombing Survey summary report], pp.12\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe devastating bombing raids of [[Dortmund]] at 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft \u2013 748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos \u2013 was a record attack on a single target in the whole of World War II.

The Germans also built large-scale night-time decoys like the  [[Krupp decoy site]] (German: Kruppsche Nachtscheinanlage) which was a German decoy-site of the [[Krupp]] steel works in [[Essen]]. During World War II, it was designed to divert Allied [[airstrike]]s from the actual production site of the arms factory.\n\n[[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] of August 1943 sought to destroy German work on long-range rockets but only delayed it by a few months. Subsequent efforts were directed against [[V-weapons]] launch sites in France.\n\n===U.S. bombing in Europe===\n[[File:Ussb-1.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Summary of AAF and RAF bombing<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey: Statistical Appendix to Overall report (European War) (Feb 1947) table 1</ref>]]\nIn mid 1942, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the English Channel. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]]'s B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns \u2014 eventually comprising up to thirteen heavy 12.7&nbsp;mm calibre, [[Browning M2#AN/M2|\"light barrel\" Browning M2]] guns per bomber \u2014 and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, D.C., and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the [[U.S. Government]] and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"[[precision bombing]]\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, [[airfield]]s, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed RAF Bomber Command operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called [[Operation Pointblank]]. Chief of the British Air Staff [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force|MRAF]] [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the [[Casablanca directive]] read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\"<ref>Harris, Arthur Travers, ed Cox, Sebastian (1995).

Despite the use of [[combat box]]es and the [[assembly ship]]s to form them, formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the [[P-51 Mustang]], which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.<ref>Richard G Davis ''American Bombardment Policy against Germany, 1942\u20131945'', Air Power Review, Volume 6 Number 3, pp. 49\u201362.

Retrieved 4 March 2010</ref>\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1,000 feet (300m) around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, overall, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area.<ref>United States Strategic Bombing Survey</ref> In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and forced Germany to divert military resources to counter it. The diversion of German fighter planes and [[anti-aircraft]] [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm artillery]] from the eastern and western fronts was a significant result of the Allied strategic bombing campaign.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-08778-0001, Dresden, Tote nach Bombenangriff.jpg|thumb|left|A pile of bodies in Dresden before cremation]]\nFor the sake of improving USAAF [[firebombing]] capabilities, a mock-up [[German Village (Dugway proving ground)|German Village]] was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Firebombing attacks proved quite successful, [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II#Battle of Hamburg|in a series of attacks launched by the RAF and US forces in July 1943 on Hamburg]], roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and large areas of the city destroyed.\n\n[[File:8th AF Bombing Marienburg.JPEG|thumb|left|A raid by the [[8th Air Force]] on the [[Focke Wulf]] factory at [[Malbork|Marienburg]], Germany (1943)]]\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]] based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength \u2014 and a [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|major change]] in fighter tactics by the Eighth Air Force, meant to secure daylight [[air supremacy]] for the Americans over Germany from the start of 1944 onwards \u2014 the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] was resumed. Planners targeted the ''Luftwaffe'' in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 its major attacks came during the [[Operation Steinbock|\"Baby Blitz\"]] period for the Luftwaffe over England, while losses for the Luftwaffe's day fighter forces were so heavy that both the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings (the intended main anti-bomber force) and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]] became largely ineffective, clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. With such heavy losses of their primary means of defense against the USAAF's tactics, German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry, with the day fighter arm never being able to fully recover in time.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, who delegated command to his deputy in [[SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including [[Winston Churchill]], Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the [[Normandy Invasion]]. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the [[USSTAF]].<ref name=\"NL309-312\">Norman Longmate, ''The Bombers:The RAF Offensive against Germany 1939\u20131945'', pp.309\u2013312</ref>\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably [[Ruhr area|the Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|such as Hamburg]], [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Kassel]], [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|Pforzheim]], [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II|Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Bombing in Romania===\n{{See also|Operation Tidal Wave|Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Oil campaign of World War II}}\n[[File:B-24D's fly over Polesti during World War II.jpg|thumb|right|15th Air Force B-24s flying through flak and over the destruction created by preceding waves of bombers ([[Ploie\u0219ti]], Romania, 1943)]]\nThe first airstrikes against Romania occurred after Romania [[Romania in World War II|joined the Third Reich]] in June 1941 during their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the following two months, [[Soviet Air Forces]] conducted several attacks against the [[King Carol I Bridge]], destroying one of its spans and damaging an [[oil pipeline]]. However, after the successful Axis powers [[Crimean Campaign]] and overall deterioration of the Soviet position, Soviet attacks against Romania ceased.\n\nThe USAAF first dropped bombs on Romania on 12 June 1942 during the [[Egypt-Libya Campaign|HALPRO (Halverson project) raid]] against Ploie\u0219ti (the first U.S. mission against a European target). Thirteen [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers under the command of Col. [[Harry A. Halverson]] from Fayid, [[Egypt]] dropped eight bombs into the [[Black Sea]], two onto [[Constan\u0163a]], six onto Ploie\u015fti, six onto [[Tei\u0219ani]], and several onto [[Ciofliceni]]. In all, three people were killed and damage was minor. The bombing of [[Ploie\u0219ti]] on 1 August 1943 ([[Operation Tidal Wave]]) was a far more serious affair. ''Tidal Wave'' heavily damaged four refineries and more lightly affected three; it damaged the Ploie\u0219ti rail station but did not have much impact on the city itself. [[C\u00e2mpina]] was more severely damaged. 660 American aircrew were killed or captured, while petroleum exports exceeded pre-Tidal Wave levels by October.<ref name=Stout>{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Jay A |date=November 2003 |title=Fortress Ploesti: The Campaign to Destroy Hitler's Oil Supply}}</ref><ref name=Dugan>{{cite book |last=Dugan |first=James |author2=Stewart, Carroll |title=Ploesti: The Great Ground-Air Battle of 1 August 1943}}</ref> Around 100 civilians were killed and 200 wounded as a result of Operation Tidal Wave.<ref name=Dugan/>\n\nAnglo-American bombers first attacked Bucharest on 4 April 1944, aiming mainly to interrupt military transports from Romania to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

All three cities suffered heavy damage and hundreds of civilian casualties, although the effects were less disastrous than those suffered by German cities, mainly because Italian cities had centres made of [[brick]] and [[stone]] buildings, while German cities had centers made of wooden buildings. Milan and Turin were bombed again in February 1943; the heaviest raids were carried out in July (295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs on Turin, killing 792 people) and August (all three cities were bombed and a total of 843 bombers dropped 2,268 tons of bombs over Milan, causing about 900 casualties). These attacks caused widespread damage and prompted most of the cities' inhabitants to flee. The only other city in Italy to be subjected to area bombing was [[La Spezia]], heavily bombed by the Bomber Command during April 1943, with slight casualties but massive damage (45% of the buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/la-spezia_res-eb3fb1e6-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ |title=SPEZIA, La in \"Enciclopedia Italiana \u2013 II Appendice\" \u2013 Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> and just 25\u201330% remained undamaged).\n\nDuring 1944 and 1945 Milan, Turin and Genoa were instead bombed by [[USAAF]] bombers, which mainly targeted factories and [[marshalling yard]]s; nonetheless, imprecision in bombings caused further destruction of vast areas.

This included raids such as those on the [[Renault]] factory in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] in March 1942 or the port facilities of [[Nantes]] in September 1943 (which killed 1,500 civilians). In preparation of Allied [[Invasion of Normandy|landings in Normandy]] and [[Operation Dragoon|those in the south of France]], French infrastructure (mainly rail transport) was intensively targeted by RAF and USAAF in May and June 1944. Despite intelligence provided by the [[French Resistance]], many residential areas were hit in error or lack of accuracy. This included cities like [[Marseille]] (2,000 dead), [[Lyon]] (1,000 dead), [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]], [[Rouen]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], [[Grenoble]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6XWJbgTSXo Newsreel from France Actualit\u00e9s on Paris Bombing]</ref> and surrounds (1000+ dead),<ref>[http://quotidien-parisiens-sous-occupation.paris.fr/dossier_bombardements Pictures of Bombing in Paris]</ref> and so on. The [[Free French Air Force]], operational since 1941, used to opt for the more risky skimming tactic when operating in national territory, to avoid civilian casualties. On 5 January 1945, British bombers struck the \"Atlantic pocket\" of [[Royan]] and destroyed 85% of this city. A later raid, using [[napalm]] was carried out before it was freed from Nazi occupation in April. Of the 3,000 civilians left in the city, 442 died.\n\nFrench civilian casualties due to Allied strategic bombing are estimated at about half of the 67,000 French civilian dead during Allied operations in 1942\u20131945; the other part being mostly killed during tactical bombing in the Normandy campaign. 22% of the bombs dropped in Europe by British and American air forces between 1940 and 1945 were in France.<ref name=\"Florentin\">Eddy Florentin, \"Quand les alli\u00e9s bombardaient la France, 1940\u20131945\", Perrin, Paris, 2008.</ref> The port city of [[Le Havre]] had been destroyed by 132 bombings during the war (5,000 dead) until September 1944.

In March 1943 there was a strategic shift: in preparation for the [[Kursk Offensive]], the bombers were directed against the German railroads behind the front.<ref name=Soviet/> In April the Long Range Air Force expanded to eight air corps and eleven independent divisions containing 700 planes. After the Kursk preparations, the Soviets turned their attention to administrative and industrial targets in [[East Prussia]] in April. With 920 aircraft taking part, they dropped 700 tonnes of bombs there. The largest Soviet bomb of the war, [[FAB-5000|an 11,000-pound weapon]], was dropped on [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] during one of these raids.<ref name=Soviet/>\n\nThroughout 1943, the Soviets attempted to give the impression of cooperation between their bombers and those of the West.<ref name=Soviet/> In February 1944, they again shifted priority, this time towards [[terror bombing]], with the goal of knocking Finland and Hungary out of the war.<ref name=Soviet/> Helsinki was struck by 733 bombers on the night of 6\u20137 February, by 367 on the 15\u201316th and 850 on the 25\u201326th.

In December the Long Range Air Force was reorganized as the [[18th Air Army]].<ref name=Soviet/>\n\nThe main task of the 18th Air Army was to support the final offensive against Germany, but it also undertook raids against Berlin, [[Breslau]], [[Danzig]] and K\u00f6nigsberg.<ref name=Soviet/> In total, 7,158 Soviet aircraft dropped 6,700 tonnes of bombs on Germany during the war, 3.1% of Soviet bomber sorties, 0.5% of all Allied \"strategic\" sorties against German-occupied territory and 0.2% of all bombs dropped on it.<ref name=Soviet/>\n\nAfter the war, Marxist historians in the Soviet Union and East Germany claimed that the Soviet strategic bombing campaign was limited by moral qualms over bombing civilian centres.<ref name=Soviet/> One early bombing theorist, [[Vasili Chripin]], whose theories influenced the Soviet Union's first strategic bombing guidelines (1936) and the service regulations of 26 January 1940, drew back from terror bombing as advocated by Western theorists.<ref name=Soviet/> The [[Spanish Civil War]] also convinced Soviet war planners that the air force was most effective when used in close cooperation with ground forces. Nonetheless, after the war, Marshal [[Vasili Sokolovsky]] admitted that the Soviets would have gladly launched a strategic bombing offensive had they the capability.<ref name=Soviet/> In reality, the Soviets never geared aircraft production towards long-range bombers, beyond the small force of indigenously designed and produced [[Petlyakov Pe-8]] four-engined \"heavies\", and so never had enough to mount an effective campaign. The land-based nature of warfare on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] also required closer cooperation between the air forces and ground troops than did, for example, the defence of Great Britain.<ref name=Soviet/>\n\n===Effectiveness===\nStrategic bombing has been criticized on practical grounds because it does not work predictably. The radical changes it forces on a targeted population can backfire, including the counterproductive result of freeing non-essential labourers to fill worker shortages in war industries.<ref name=\"J.K. Galbraith 1958\"/>\n\nMuch of the doubt about the effectiveness of the bomber war comes from the fact that German industrial production increased throughout the war.<ref name=\"Williamson Murray p. 319\"/> A combination of factors helped increase German war material output, these included; continuing development from production lines started before the war, limiting competing models of equipment, government enforced sharing of production techniques, a change in how contracts were priced and an aggressive worker suggestion program. At the same time production plants had to deal with a loss of experienced workers to the military, assimilating untrained workers, culling workers incapable of being trained, and utilizing unwilling forced labor. Strategic bombing failed to reduce German war production. There is insufficient information to ascertain how much additional potential industrial growth the bombing campaign may have curtailed.<ref name=\"econ.yale.edu\"/> However, attacks on the infrastructure were taking place. The attacks on Germany's canals and railroads made transportation of [[materiel]] difficult.<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/>\n\nThe [[Oil Campaign of World War II]] was, however, extremely successful and made a very large contribution to the general collapse of Germany in 1945. In the event, the bombing of oil facilities became [[Albert Speer]]'s main concern; however, this occurred sufficiently late in the war that Germany would soon be defeated in any case.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nGerman insiders credit the Allied bombing offensive with crippling the German war industry. Speer repeatedly said (both during and after the war) it caused crucial production problems. Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], head of the [[U-boat]] fleet (''U-waffe''), noted in his memoirs failure to get the revolutionary [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] U-boats (which could have completely altered the balance of power in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]) into service was entirely the result of the bombing. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)|United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)]], says, despite bombing becoming a major effort, between December 1942 and June 1943, \"The attack on the construction yards and slipways was not heavy enough to be more than troublesome\" and the delays in delivery of Type XXIs and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIIIs]] up until November 1944 \"cannot be attributed to the air attack\",<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/> but adds, \"The attacks during the late winter and early spring of 1945 did close, or all but close, five of the major yards, including the great Blohm and Voss plant at Hamburg\".<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/>\n\n===Effect on morale===\n[[File:Effects of strategic bombing on German morale.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the effects of strategic bombing on German morale in 1945. From the United States [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], Morale Division.]]\n\nAlthough designed to \"break the enemy's will\", the opposite often happened. The British did not crumble under the German [[The Blitz|Blitz]] and other [[strategic bombing|air raids]] early in the war. British workers continued to work throughout the war and food and other basic supplies were available throughout.\n\nThe impact of bombing on German morale was significant according to Professor [[John Buckley (historian)|John Buckley]]. Around a third of the urban population under threat of bombing had no protection at all. Some of the major cities saw 55\u201360 percent of dwellings destroyed. Mass evacuations were a partial answer for six million civilians, but this had a severe effect on morale as German families were split up to live in difficult conditions. By 1944, absenteeism rates of 20\u201325 percent were not unusual and in post-war analysis 91 percent of civilians stated bombing was the most difficult hardship to endure and was the key factor in the collapse of their own morale.<ref name=\"Buckley 1998, p. 166\">Buckley 1998, p. 166.</ref> The United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the bombing was not stiffening morale but seriously depressing it; fatalism, apathy, defeatism were apparent in bombed areas. The ''Luftwaffe'' was blamed for not warding off the attacks and confidence in the Nazi regime fell by 14 percent. By the spring of 1944, some 75 percent of Germans believed the war was lost, owing to the intensity of the bombing.<ref>Kershaw 1987, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\nBuckley argues the German war economy did indeed expand significantly following [[Albert Speer]]'s appointment as Reichsminister of Armaments, \"but it is spurious to argue that because production increased then bombing had no real impact\". The bombing offensive did do serious damage to German production levels.

Prior to that a single raid was launched from carriers in 1942, and ineffective long-range raids were launched from China from June to December 1944. In the last seven months of the campaign, a change to firebombing resulted in great destruction of 67 Japanese cities, as many as 500,000 Japanese deaths and some 5 million more made homeless. [[Emperor Hirohito]]'s viewing of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945 is said to have been the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] five months later.<ref>Bradley, F.

The raid was a military pinprick but a significant [[propaganda]] victory. Because they were launched prematurely, none of the aircraft had enough fuel to reach their designated landing sites, and so either crashed or ditched (except for one aircraft, which landed in the Soviet Union, where the crew was interned). Two crews were captured by the Japanese.\n\n[[File:Firebombing of Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|Tokyo burns during a [[Firebombing|firebomb]] attack 26 May 1945.]]\n\nThe key development for the bombing of Japan was the [[B-29 Superfortress]], which had an operational range of 1,500 miles (2,400&nbsp;km); almost 90% of the bombs (147,000 tons) dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this bomber. The [[Bombing of Yawata (June 1944)|first raid by B-29s on Japan]] was on 15 June 1944, from China. The B-29s took off from [[Chengdu]], over 1,500 miles away. This raid was also not particularly effective: only forty-seven of the sixty-eight bombers hit the target area.\n\n[[File:Bomb damage in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|This postwar photograph shows the district of [[Sumida, Tokyo]] being virtually flattened.]]\n\nRaids of Japan from mainland China, called [[Operation Matterhorn]], were carried out by the [[Twentieth Air Force]] under [[XX Bomber Command]]. Initially the commanding officer of the Twentieth Air Force was [[Hap Arnold]], and later [[Curtis LeMay]]. Bombing Japan from China was never a satisfactory arrangement because not only were the Chinese airbases difficult to supply\u2014materiel being sent by air from India over \"[[the Hump]]\"\u2014but the B-29s operating from them could only reach Japan if they traded some of their bomb load for extra fuel in tanks in the bomb-bays. When Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]'s [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] campaign captured Pacific islands close enough to Japan to be within the B-29's range, the Twentieth Air Force was assigned to [[XXI Bomber Command]], which organized a much more effective bombing campaign of the Japanese home islands. Based in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] ([[Guam]] and [[Tinian]] in particular), the B-29s were able to carry their full bomb loads and were supplied by cargo ships and tankers. The first raid from the Mariana was on 24 November 1944, when 88 aircraft bombed Tokyo. The bombs were dropped from around 30,000 feet (10,000 m) and it is estimated that only around 10% hit their targets.\n\n[[File:Areas of principal Japanese cities destoyed by US bombing.jpg|left|thumb|Conventional bombs from [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] destroyed over 40% of the urban area in Japan's six greatest industrial cities.]]\nUnlike all other forces in theater, the [[Bomber Command#USAAF|USAAF Bomber Commands]] did not report to the commanders of the theaters but directly to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. In July 1945, they were placed under the [[U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]], which was commanded by General [[Carl Spaatz]].\n\nAs in Europe, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) tried daylight [[precision bombing]]. However, it proved to be impossible due to the weather around Japan, \"during the best month for bombing in Japan, visual bombing was possible for [just] seven days. The worst had only one good day.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Kaplan | first = Fred | authorlink = Fred Kaplan (journalist) | title = The Wizards of Armageddon | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-671-42444-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/wizardsofarmaged00fred }}[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJXu7kMSc44C&pg=PA42 p.42]</ref> Further, bombs dropped from a great height were tossed about by high winds.\n\nGeneral LeMay, commander of XXI Bomber Command, instead switched to mass firebombing night attacks from altitudes of around 7,000 feet (2,100 m) on the major [[conurbation]]s. \"He looked up the size of the large Japanese cities in the ''World Almanac'' and picked his targets accordingly.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Kaplan | first = Fred | title = The Wizards of Armageddon | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-671-42444-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/wizardsofarmaged00fred }}[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJXu7kMSc44C&pg=PA43 p.43]</ref> Priority targets were Tokyo, [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], and [[Kobe]]. Despite limited early success, particularly against Nagoya, LeMay was determined to use such bombing tactics against the vulnerable Japanese cities. Attacks on strategic targets also continued in lower-level daylight raids.\n\nThe first successful [[firebombing]] raid was [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|on Kobe]] on 3 February 1945, and following its relative success the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] continued the tactic. Nearly half of the principal factories of the city were damaged, and production was reduced by more than half at one of the port's two shipyards.\n\n[[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|The first raid of this type on Tokyo]] was on the night of 23\u201324 February when 174 B-29s destroyed around one square mile (3&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the city. Following on that success, as [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Operation Meetinghouse]], 334 B-29s raided on the night of 9\u201310 March, of which 282 Superforts reached their targets, dropping around 1,700 tons of bombs. Around 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the city was destroyed and over 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the [[fire storm]]. It was the most destructive conventional raid, and the deadliest single bombing raid of any kind in terms of lives lost, in all of military aviation history,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2011/03/0309incendiary-bombs-kill-100000-tokyo/ |title=9 March 1945: Burning the Heart Out of the Enemy |date=9 March 2011 |journal=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> even when the missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are taken as single events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/bombings-worse-nagasaki-hiroshima/ |title=Bombings Worse than Nagasaki and Hiroshima |author=Laurence M.

By June, over forty percent of the urban area of Japan's largest six cities (Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, [[Yokohama]], and [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]) was devastated. LeMay's fleet of nearly 600 bombers destroyed tens of smaller cities and manufacturing centres in the following weeks and months.\n\nLeaflets were dropped over cities before they were bombed, warning the inhabitants and urging them to escape the city. Though many{{Who|date=January 2017}}, even within the Air Force, viewed this as a form of [[psychological warfare]], a significant element in the decision to produce and drop them was the desire to assuage American anxieties about the extent of the destruction created by this new war tactic. Warning leaflets were also dropped on cities not in fact targeted, to create uncertainty and absenteeism.\n\nA year after the war, the [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)|U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey]] reported that American military officials had underestimated the power of strategic bombing combined with naval blockade and previous military defeats to bring Japan to unconditional surrender without invasion. By July 1945, only a fraction of the planned strategic bombing force had been deployed yet there were few targets left worth the effort. In hindsight, it would have been more effective to use land-based and carrier-based air power to strike merchant shipping and begin aerial mining at a much earlier date so as to link up with effective [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|submarine anti-shipping campaign]] and completely isolate the island nation. This would have accelerated the strangulation of Japan and ended the war sooner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm |title=United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War). 1 July 1946 |publisher=Anesi.com |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> A postwar [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] survey agreed, finding naval mines dropped by B-29s had accounted for 60% of all Japanese shipping losses in the last six months of the war.<ref name=autogenerated2>Hallion, Dr. Richard P.

On 1 April 1945, U.S. troops [[Battle of Okinawa|invaded the island of Okinawa]] and fought there fiercely against not only enemy soldiers, but also enemy civilians. After two and a half months, 12,000 U.S. servicemen, 107,000 Japanese soldiers, and over 150,000 Okinawan civilians (included those forced to fight) were killed. Given the casualty rate in Okinawa, American commanders realized a grisly picture of the intended invasion of mainland Japan. When President [[Harry S. Truman]] was briefed on what would happen during an invasion of Japan, he could not afford such a horrendous casualty rate, added to over 400,000 U.S. servicemen who had already died fighting in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Ham|title=Hiroshima Nagasaki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7hw0x0WEz4C&pg=PA196|year=2012|publisher=Transworld|page=196ff|isbn=9781448126279}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[mushroom cloud]] of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan]], 1945, rose some 18 km (11 mi) above the [[hypocentre]].]]\n\nHoping to forestall the invasion, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China issued a [[Potsdam Declaration]] on 26 July 1945, demanding that the Japanese government accept an [[unconditional surrender]]. The declaration also stated that if Japan did not surrender, it would be faced with \"prompt and utter destruction\", a process which was already underway with the incendiary bombing raids destroying 40% of targeted cities, and by naval warfare isolating and starving Japan of imported food.

[[Strategic bombing]] is a [[military strategy]] which is distinct from both [[close air support]] of ground forces and [[Air supremacy#World War II|tactical air power]].<ref>R.J. Overy, ''The Air War. 1939\u20131945'' (1980) pp. 8\u201314</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, it was believed by many military strategists of [[air power]] that major victories could be won by attacking industrial and political infrastructure, rather than purely military targets.<ref>Tami Davis Biddle, \"British and American Approaches to Strategic Bombing: Their Origins and Implementation in the World War II Combined Bomber Offensive\", ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1995) 18#1 pp 91\u2013144</ref> Strategic bombing often involved bombing areas inhabited by civilians and some campaigns were deliberately designed to target civilian populations in order to terrorize and disrupt their usual activities. [[International law]] at the outset of World War II did not specifically forbid aerial bombardment of cities despite the prior occurrence of such bombing during [[World War I]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nStrategic bombing during World War II began on 1 September 1939 when Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German Air Force) [[Bombing of Wielu\u0144|began bombing]] cities and the civilian population in Poland in an indiscriminate [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|aerial bombardment campaign]].<ref>Levine 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LZ99c7ZlxxQC&pg=PA21 p. 21]</ref> As the war continued to expand, bombing by both the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] increased significantly. The [[Royal Air Force]] began bombing military targets in Germany, such as [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s and [[shipyard]]s, in March 1940.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ww2today.com/the-first-bombing-raid-on-germany |title = The first bombing raid on Germany by the RAF in World War II}}</ref> In September 1940, the Luftwaffe began targeting British cities in [[the Blitz]].<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 52\"/> After the beginning of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941, the Luftwaffe [[Axis and Soviet air operations during Operation Barbarossa|attacked]] Soviet cities and infrastructure.

Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update [[international humanitarian law]] to include [[aerial warfare]], it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the [[laws of war]], but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=G\u00f3mez|first=Javier Guis\u00e1ndez|date=20 June 1998|title=The Law of Air Warfare|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=n\u00ba 323|pages=347\u201363|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1}}</ref> This means that aerial bombardment of civilian areas in enemy territory by all major belligerents during World War II was not prohibited by [[Positive international law|positive]] or specific [[Customary international law|customary]] international humanitarian law.<ref>{{cite book |title=Terror from the Sky: The Bombing of German Cities in World War II |year=2010 |page=167 |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=978-1-8454-5844-7}}</ref>\n\nMany reasons exist for the absence of international law regarding aerial bombing in World War II.<ref>Evangeslista, Matthew. \"Peace Studies, Volume 3\". page 447. [[Routledge]].</ref> Most nations had refused to ratify such laws or agreements because of the vague or impractical wording in treaties such as the 1923 Hague Rules of Air Warfare. Also, the major powers' possession of newly developed advanced bombers was a great military advantage; they would be hard pressed to accept any negotiated limitations regarding this new weapon. In the absence of specific laws relating to aerial warfare, the belligerents' aerial forces at the start of World War II used the 1907 Hague Conventions \u2014 signed and ratified by most major powers \u2014 as the customary standard to govern their conduct in warfare, and these conventions were interpreted by both sides to allow the indiscriminate bombing of enemy cities throughout the war.<ref name=\"HARRIS\">{{cite book |title=Despatch on War Operations: 23rd February 1942 to 8th May 1945 |date=30 November 1995 |author=Sir Arthur Harris |page=44 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7146-4692-3}}</ref>\n\nGeneral [[Telford Taylor]], Chief Counsel for [[War Crimes]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], wrote that:\n{{quote|If the first badly bombed cities \u2014 [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]], [[Rotterdam Blitz|Rotterdam]], [[Operation Retribution (1941)|Belgrade]], and [[The Blitz|London]] \u2014 suffered at the hands of the Germans and not the Allies, nonetheless the ruins of German and Japanese cities were the results not of reprisal but of deliberate policy, and bore witness that aerial bombardment of cities and factories has become a recognized part of [[modern warfare]] as carried out by all nations.<ref name=\"HARRIS\" />}}\nArticle 25 of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on Land Warfare also did not provide a clear guideline on the extent to which civilians may be spared; the same can be held for naval forces.

In spring of 1937, just when the Luftwaffe's own Technical Office had passed the [[Junkers Ju 89|Ju-89]] and [[Dornier Do 19|Do-19]] heavy bomber models as ready for testing, Goering ordered a halt to all work on the four-engine strategic bomber program.<ref>Trigg, \"The Defeat of the Luftwaffe\" 2016, p. 52-56</ref> However, in 1939 the ''[[Bomber B]]'' program sought to produce a twin-engined strategic bomber that could carry nearly-equivalent bombloads of Allied four-engined heavy bombers, but as an advanced development of the pre-war ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' concept. The ''Bomber B'' designs meant to achieve top level speeds of at least 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph). The ''Bomber B'' program went nowhere, as the intended designs required pairs of combat-reliable aviation engines of at least 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000 PS) apiece,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} something that the German aviation engine industry had [[Bomber B#High-output engines|serious problems in developing]]. A further design program was initiated in the late spring of 1942, to develop four-engine (and later six-engine) bombers with trans-Atlantic range to attack the continental United States and aptly named the ''[[Amerika Bomber]]''. This also went nowhere, with only five prototype airframes from two design competitors getting airborne for testing, before the war's end.\n\nThe only heavy bomber design to see service with the ''Luftwaffe'' in World War II was the trouble-prone [[Heinkel He 177]]A. In the initial design of November 1937, the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] had mistakenly decided that the He 177 should also have a medium angle \"dive bombing\" capability. [[Ernst Heinkel]] and Milch vehemently disagreed with this, but the requirement was not rescinded until September 1942 by Goering himself.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 53</ref> The He 177A went into service in April 1942, despite an ongoing series of engine fires in the small batch of A-0 series production prototype aircraft. This deficiency, along with numerous, seriously deficient design features \u2014 led Goering to decry the He 177A's [[Daimler-Benz DB 606]] powerplants to be nothing more than fire-prone, cumbersome [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] in August of that year.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 52</ref> Production of the B-series by Heinkel's only subcontractor for the ''Greif'', ''[[Arado Flugzeugwerke]]'', would not have started until November 1944, because of Arado's focus on the production of its own [[Arado Ar 234]] jet-powered reconnaissance-bomber at the time.<ref>Griehl and Dressel, p 165</ref> The July 1944-initiated [[Emergency Fighter Program|''J\u00e4gernotprogramm'']], as well as the devastating effects of Allied bombing on the entire German aviation industry, prevented any production of the He 177B design.\n\n[[File:V-2victimAntwerp1944.jpg|thumb|right|One of the victims of a German [[V-2 rocket]] that struck Teniers Square, Antwerp, Belgium on 27 November 1944]]\n\nThe He 177A entered service in April 1942.

Should the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) be scaled back to allow more resources to go to the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] or should the strategic bombing option be followed and expanded? An influential paper was presented to support the bombing campaign by Professor [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], the British government's leading scientific adviser, justifying the use of area bombing to \"[[Dehousing|dehouse]]\" the German workforce as the most effective way of reducing their morale and affecting enemy war production.<ref>Levine 1992, p. 39.</ref>\n\n[[John Edward Singleton|Mr. Justice Singleton]], a High Court Judge, was asked by Cabinet to look into the competing points of view. In his report, delivered on 20 May 1942, he concluded:\n{{quote|If Russia can hold Germany on land I doubt whether Germany will stand 12 or 18 months' continuous, intensified and increased bombing, affecting, as it must, her war production, her power of resistance, her industries and her will to resist (by which I mean morale).<ref>Longmate 1983, p.133</ref><ref>Copp 1996.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Issues/Singletn.php |title=Issues : Singleton \u2013 World War Two |publisher=Valourandhorror.com |accessdate=1 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227151505/http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Issues/Singletn.php |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn the end, thanks in part to the dehousing paper, it was this view which prevailed and Bomber Command would remain an important component of the British war effort up to the end of World War II. A large proportion of the industrial production of the United Kingdom was harnessed to the task of creating a vast fleet of heavy bombers. Until 1944, the effect on German production was remarkably small and raised doubts whether it was wise to divert so much effort\u2014the response being there was nowhere else the effort could have been applied, as readily, to greater effect.\n\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 1945, despite being hit dozens of times by Allied bombs, the [[Cologne Cathedral]] survived the war.]]\n\nLindemann was liked and trusted by [[Winston Churchill]], who appointed him the British government's leading scientific adviser with a seat in the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. In 1942, Lindemann presented the \"[[dehousing paper]]\" to the Cabinet showing the effect that intensive bombing of German cities could produce. It was accepted by the Cabinet, and [[Arthur Travers Harris|Air Marshal Harris]] was appointed to carry out the task. It became an important part of the [[total war]] waged against Germany. Professor Lindemann's paper put forward the theory of attacking major industrial centres in order to deliberately destroy as many homes and houses as possible. Working-class homes were to be targeted because they had a higher density and fire storms were more likely. This would displace the German workforce and reduce their ability to work. His calculations (which were questioned at the time, in particular by Professor [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|P. M. S. Blackett]] of the Admiralty [[operations research]] department, expressly refuting Lindemann's conclusions)<ref>This was the sole attempt to analyse Bomber Command policy during the war. ''Ethics and Airpower''.</ref> showed the RAF's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] would be able to destroy the majority of German houses located in cities quite quickly. The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought that bombing was the only option available to directly attack Germany (as a major invasion of the continent was almost two years away), and the Soviets were demanding that the Western Allies do something to relieve the pressure on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Few in Britain opposed this policy, but there were three notable opponents in Parliament, Bishop [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]] and the Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Richard Stokes]] and [[Alfred Salter]]. No effort to examine the effects of bombing was ever made.<ref>''Ethics and Airpower''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Altstadt-Zerstoerung-Luftbild 1944.jpg|thumb|The area near the [[Frankfurt Cathedral]] after a bombing, March 1945]]\nOn 14 February 1942, the [[area bombing directive]] was issued to Bomber Command. Bombing was to be \"focused on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of the industrial workers.\" Though it was never explicitly declared, this was the nearest that the British got to a declaration of unrestricted aerial bombing \u2013 Directive 22 said \"You are accordingly authorised to use your forces without restriction\", and then listing a series of primary targets which included [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], [[Duisburg]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Cologne]]. Secondary targets included [[Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II|Braunschweig]], [[L\u00fcbeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], [[Kiel]], [[Hanover]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Mannheim]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Schweinfurt]]. The directive stated that \"operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civilian population, and in particular, the industrial workers\". Lest there be any confusion, [[Sir Charles Portal]] wrote to [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Norman Bottomley]] on 15 February \"...I suppose it is clear that the aiming points will be the built-up areas, and not, for instance, the dockyards or aircraft factories\". Factories were no longer targets.<ref>Levine 1992, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe first true practical demonstrations were on the night of 28 to 29 March 1942, when 234 aircraft [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|bombed]] the ancient [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] port of L\u00fcbeck. This target was chosen not because it was a significant military target, but because it was expected to be particularly susceptible \u2013 in Harris's words it was \"built more like a fire lighter than a city\". The ancient timber structures burned well, and the raid destroyed most of the city's centre. A few days later, Rostock suffered the same fate.\n\n[[File:Lancaster over Hamburg.jpg|thumb|An [[Avro Lancaster]] [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|over Hamburg]]]]\nAt this stage of the air war, the most effective and disruptive examples of area bombing were the \"thousand-bomber raids\". Bomber Command was able by organization and drafting in as many aircraft as possible to assemble very large forces which could then attack a single area, overwhelming the defences. The aircraft would be staggered so that they would arrive over the target in succession: the new technique of the \"[[bomber stream]]\".\n\nOn 30 May 1942, between 0047 and 0225 hours, in [[Operation Millennium]] 1,046 bombers dropped over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town of [[Cologne]], and the resulting fires burned it from end to end. The damage inflicted was extensive. The fires could be seen 600 miles away at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Some 3,300 houses were destroyed, and 10,000 were damaged. 12,000 separate fires raged destroying 36 factories, damaging 270 more, and leaving 45,000 people with nowhere to live or to work. Only 384 civilians and 85 soldiers were killed, but thousands evacuated the city. Bomber Command lost 40 bombers.\n\nTwo further thousand-bomber raids were conducted over [[Essen]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], but neither so utterly shook both sides as the scale of the destruction at Cologne and Hamburg.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The effects of the massive raids using a combination of [[blockbuster bomb]]s (to blow off roofs) and incendiaries (to start fires in the exposed buildings) created [[firestorm]]s in some cities. The most extreme examples of which were caused by [[Operation Gomorrah]], the combined USAAF/RAF [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|attack on Hamburg]], (45,000 dead), [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|attack on Kassel]] (10,000 dead), the [[Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II|attack on Darmstadt]] (12,500 dead), the [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|attack on Pforzheim]] (21,200 dead), the attack on Swinemuende (23,000 dead) and the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|attack on Dresden]] (25,000 dead).\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-025-19A, Koeln, Kinderleichen nach Luftangriff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An elderly woman in front of the bodies of school children in [[Cologne]], Germany, after a bombing raid]]\nAccording to economic historian [[Adam Tooze]], in his book ''[[The Wages of Destruction|The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy]]'', a turning point in the bomber offensive was reached in March 1943, during the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Over five months 34,000 tons of bombs were dropped. Following the raids, steel production fell by 200,000 tons, making a shortfall of 400,000 tons. Speer acknowledged that the RAF were hitting the right targets, and raids severely disrupted his plans to increase production to meet increasing attritional needs. Between July 1943 and March 1944 there were no further increases in the output of aircraft.<ref>Tooze 2002, pp. 597\u2013598.</ref>\n\nThe bombing of Hamburg in 1943 also produced impressive results. [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Attacks on Tiger I]] heavy tank production, and of that of 88mm guns, the most potent dual-purpose artillery piece in the ''Wehrmacht'', meant that output of both was \"set back for months\". On top of this, some 62 percent of the population was dehoused causing more difficulties. However, RAF Bomber Command allowed itself to be distracted by Harris' desire for a war winning blow, and attempted the fruitless missions to [[Battle of Berlin (air)|destroy Berlin]] and end the war by spring, 1944.<ref>Tooze 2002, p. 602.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wesel 1945.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Wesel]] in 1945. 97% of all buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing.]]\nIn October 1943, Harris urged the government to be honest with the public regarding the purpose of the bombing campaign. To Harris, his complete success at Hamburg confirmed the validity and necessity of his methods, and he urged that:\n\n{{quote|the aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.<ref>Denson 1999, p. 352.</ref><ref>Garret 1993, pp. 32\u201333.</ref><br />... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy.

It had immediate effects on shipments of goods, and especially coal deliveries, upon which Germany's economy depended; with no more additional effort, by February 1945, rail transport (which competed for coal) had seen its shipments cut by more than half, and by March, \"except in limited areas, the coal supply had been eliminated.\"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/ETO-Summary.html#taotraw%22 Strategic Bombing Survey summary report], pp.12\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe devastating bombing raids of [[Dortmund]] at 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft \u2013 748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos \u2013 was a record attack on a single target in the whole of World War II.

The Germans also built large-scale night-time decoys like the  [[Krupp decoy site]] (German: Kruppsche Nachtscheinanlage) which was a German decoy-site of the [[Krupp]] steel works in [[Essen]]. During World War II, it was designed to divert Allied [[airstrike]]s from the actual production site of the arms factory.\n\n[[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] of August 1943 sought to destroy German work on long-range rockets but only delayed it by a few months. Subsequent efforts were directed against [[V-weapons]] launch sites in France.\n\n===U.S. bombing in Europe===\n[[File:Ussb-1.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Summary of AAF and RAF bombing<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey: Statistical Appendix to Overall report (European War) (Feb 1947) table 1</ref>]]\nIn mid 1942, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the English Channel. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]]'s B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns \u2014 eventually comprising up to thirteen heavy 12.7&nbsp;mm calibre, [[Browning M2#AN/M2|\"light barrel\" Browning M2]] guns per bomber \u2014 and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, D.C., and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the [[U.S. Government]] and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"[[precision bombing]]\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, [[airfield]]s, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed RAF Bomber Command operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called [[Operation Pointblank]]. Chief of the British Air Staff [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force|MRAF]] [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the [[Casablanca directive]] read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\"<ref>Harris, Arthur Travers, ed Cox, Sebastian (1995).

Despite the use of [[combat box]]es and the [[assembly ship]]s to form them, formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the [[P-51 Mustang]], which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.<ref>Richard G Davis ''American Bombardment Policy against Germany, 1942\u20131945'', Air Power Review, Volume 6 Number 3, pp. 49\u201362.

Retrieved 4 March 2010</ref>\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1,000 feet (300m) around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, overall, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area.<ref>United States Strategic Bombing Survey</ref> In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and forced Germany to divert military resources to counter it. The diversion of German fighter planes and [[anti-aircraft]] [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm artillery]] from the eastern and western fronts was a significant result of the Allied strategic bombing campaign.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-08778-0001, Dresden, Tote nach Bombenangriff.jpg|thumb|left|A pile of bodies in Dresden before cremation]]\nFor the sake of improving USAAF [[firebombing]] capabilities, a mock-up [[German Village (Dugway proving ground)|German Village]] was built up and repeatedly burned down.

Firebombing attacks proved quite successful, [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II#Battle of Hamburg|in a series of attacks launched by the RAF and US forces in July 1943 on Hamburg]], roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and large areas of the city destroyed.\n\n[[File:8th AF Bombing Marienburg.JPEG|thumb|left|A raid by the [[8th Air Force]] on the [[Focke Wulf]] factory at [[Malbork|Marienburg]], Germany (1943)]]\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]] based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength \u2014 and a [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|major change]] in fighter tactics by the Eighth Air Force, meant to secure daylight [[air supremacy]] for the Americans over Germany from the start of 1944 onwards \u2014 the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] was resumed. Planners targeted the ''Luftwaffe'' in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 its major attacks came during the [[Operation Steinbock|\"Baby Blitz\"]] period for the Luftwaffe over England, while losses for the Luftwaffe's day fighter forces were so heavy that both the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings (the intended main anti-bomber force) and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]] became largely ineffective, clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. With such heavy losses of their primary means of defense against the USAAF's tactics, German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry, with the day fighter arm never being able to fully recover in time.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, who delegated command to his deputy in [[SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including [[Winston Churchill]], Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the [[Normandy Invasion]]. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the [[USSTAF]].<ref name=\"NL309-312\">Norman Longmate, ''The Bombers:The RAF Offensive against Germany 1939\u20131945'', pp.309\u2013312</ref>\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably [[Ruhr area|the Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|such as Hamburg]], [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Kassel]], [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|Pforzheim]], [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II|Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Bombing in Romania===\n{{See also|Operation Tidal Wave|Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Oil campaign of World War II}}\n[[File:B-24D's fly over Polesti during World War II.jpg|thumb|right|15th Air Force B-24s flying through flak and over the destruction created by preceding waves of bombers ([[Ploie\u0219ti]], Romania, 1943)]]\nThe first airstrikes against Romania occurred after Romania [[Romania in World War II|joined the Third Reich]] in June 1941 during their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the following two months, [[Soviet Air Forces]] conducted several attacks against the [[King Carol I Bridge]], destroying one of its spans and damaging an [[oil pipeline]]. However, after the successful Axis powers [[Crimean Campaign]] and overall deterioration of the Soviet position, Soviet attacks against Romania ceased.\n\nThe USAAF first dropped bombs on Romania on 12 June 1942 during the [[Egypt-Libya Campaign|HALPRO (Halverson project) raid]] against Ploie\u0219ti (the first U.S. mission against a European target). Thirteen [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers under the command of Col. [[Harry A. Halverson]] from Fayid, [[Egypt]] dropped eight bombs into the [[Black Sea]], two onto [[Constan\u0163a]], six onto Ploie\u015fti, six onto [[Tei\u0219ani]], and several onto [[Ciofliceni]]. In all, three people were killed and damage was minor. The bombing of [[Ploie\u0219ti]] on 1 August 1943 ([[Operation Tidal Wave]]) was a far more serious affair. ''Tidal Wave'' heavily damaged four refineries and more lightly affected three; it damaged the Ploie\u0219ti rail station but did not have much impact on the city itself. [[C\u00e2mpina]] was more severely damaged. 660 American aircrew were killed or captured, while petroleum exports exceeded pre-Tidal Wave levels by October.<ref name=Stout>{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Jay A |date=November 2003 |title=Fortress Ploesti: The Campaign to Destroy Hitler's Oil Supply}}</ref><ref name=Dugan>{{cite book |last=Dugan |first=James |author2=Stewart, Carroll |title=Ploesti: The Great Ground-Air Battle of 1 August 1943}}</ref> Around 100 civilians were killed and 200 wounded as a result of Operation Tidal Wave.<ref name=Dugan/>\n\nAnglo-American bombers first attacked Bucharest on 4 April 1944, aiming mainly to interrupt military transports from Romania to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

All three cities suffered heavy damage and hundreds of civilian casualties, although the effects were less disastrous than those suffered by German cities, mainly because Italian cities had centres made of [[brick]] and [[stone]] buildings, while German cities had centers made of wooden buildings. Milan and Turin were bombed again in February 1943; the heaviest raids were carried out in July (295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs on Turin, killing 792 people) and August (all three cities were bombed and a total of 843 bombers dropped 2,268 tons of bombs over Milan, causing about 900 casualties). These attacks caused widespread damage and prompted most of the cities' inhabitants to flee. The only other city in Italy to be subjected to area bombing was [[La Spezia]], heavily bombed by the Bomber Command during April 1943, with slight casualties but massive damage (45% of the buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/la-spezia_res-eb3fb1e6-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ |title=SPEZIA, La in \"Enciclopedia Italiana \u2013 II Appendice\" \u2013 Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> and just 25\u201330% remained undamaged).\n\nDuring 1944 and 1945 Milan, Turin and Genoa were instead bombed by [[USAAF]] bombers, which mainly targeted factories and [[marshalling yard]]s; nonetheless, imprecision in bombings caused further destruction of vast areas.

This included raids such as those on the [[Renault]] factory in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] in March 1942 or the port facilities of [[Nantes]] in September 1943 (which killed 1,500 civilians). In preparation of Allied [[Invasion of Normandy|landings in Normandy]] and [[Operation Dragoon|those in the south of France]], French infrastructure (mainly rail transport) was intensively targeted by RAF and USAAF in May and June 1944. Despite intelligence provided by the [[French Resistance]], many residential areas were hit in error or lack of accuracy. This included cities like [[Marseille]] (2,000 dead), [[Lyon]] (1,000 dead), [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]], [[Rouen]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], [[Grenoble]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6XWJbgTSXo Newsreel from France Actualit\u00e9s on Paris Bombing]</ref> and surrounds (1000+ dead),<ref>[http://quotidien-parisiens-sous-occupation.paris.fr/dossier_bombardements Pictures of Bombing in Paris]</ref> and so on. The [[Free French Air Force]], operational since 1941, used to opt for the more risky skimming tactic when operating in national territory, to avoid civilian casualties. On 5 January 1945, British bombers struck the \"Atlantic pocket\" of [[Royan]] and destroyed 85% of this city. A later raid, using [[napalm]] was carried out before it was freed from Nazi occupation in April. Of the 3,000 civilians left in the city, 442 died.\n\nFrench civilian casualties due to Allied strategic bombing are estimated at about half of the 67,000 French civilian dead during Allied operations in 1942\u20131945; the other part being mostly killed during tactical bombing in the Normandy campaign. 22% of the bombs dropped in Europe by British and American air forces between 1940 and 1945 were in France.<ref name=\"Florentin\">Eddy Florentin, \"Quand les alli\u00e9s bombardaient la France, 1940\u20131945\", Perrin, Paris, 2008.</ref> The port city of [[Le Havre]] had been destroyed by 132 bombings during the war (5,000 dead) until September 1944.

In March 1943 there was a strategic shift: in preparation for the [[Kursk Offensive]], the bombers were directed against the German railroads behind the front.<ref name=Soviet/> In April the Long Range Air Force expanded to eight air corps and eleven independent divisions containing 700 planes. After the Kursk preparations, the Soviets turned their attention to administrative and industrial targets in [[East Prussia]] in April. With 920 aircraft taking part, they dropped 700 tonnes of bombs there.

In December the Long Range Air Force was reorganized as the [[18th Air Army]].<ref name=Soviet/>\n\nThe main task of the 18th Air Army was to support the final offensive against Germany, but it also undertook raids against Berlin, [[Breslau]], [[Danzig]] and K\u00f6nigsberg.<ref name=Soviet/> In total, 7,158 Soviet aircraft dropped 6,700 tonnes of bombs on Germany during the war, 3.1% of Soviet bomber sorties, 0.5% of all Allied \"strategic\" sorties against German-occupied territory and 0.2% of all bombs dropped on it.<ref name=Soviet/>\n\nAfter the war, Marxist historians in the Soviet Union and East Germany claimed that the Soviet strategic bombing campaign was limited by moral qualms over bombing civilian centres.<ref name=Soviet/> One early bombing theorist, [[Vasili Chripin]], whose theories influenced the Soviet Union's first strategic bombing guidelines (1936) and the service regulations of 26 January 1940, drew back from terror bombing as advocated by Western theorists.<ref name=Soviet/> The [[Spanish Civil War]] also convinced Soviet war planners that the air force was most effective when used in close cooperation with ground forces. Nonetheless, after the war, Marshal [[Vasili Sokolovsky]] admitted that the Soviets would have gladly launched a strategic bombing offensive had they the capability.<ref name=Soviet/> In reality, the Soviets never geared aircraft production towards long-range bombers, beyond the small force of indigenously designed and produced [[Petlyakov Pe-8]] four-engined \"heavies\", and so never had enough to mount an effective campaign. The land-based nature of warfare on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] also required closer cooperation between the air forces and ground troops than did, for example, the defence of Great Britain.<ref name=Soviet/>\n\n===Effectiveness===\nStrategic bombing has been criticized on practical grounds because it does not work predictably. The radical changes it forces on a targeted population can backfire, including the counterproductive result of freeing non-essential labourers to fill worker shortages in war industries.<ref name=\"J.K. Galbraith 1958\"/>\n\nMuch of the doubt about the effectiveness of the bomber war comes from the fact that German industrial production increased throughout the war.<ref name=\"Williamson Murray p. 319\"/> A combination of factors helped increase German war material output, these included; continuing development from production lines started before the war, limiting competing models of equipment, government enforced sharing of production techniques, a change in how contracts were priced and an aggressive worker suggestion program. At the same time production plants had to deal with a loss of experienced workers to the military, assimilating untrained workers, culling workers incapable of being trained, and utilizing unwilling forced labor. Strategic bombing failed to reduce German war production. There is insufficient information to ascertain how much additional potential industrial growth the bombing campaign may have curtailed.<ref name=\"econ.yale.edu\"/> However, attacks on the infrastructure were taking place. The attacks on Germany's canals and railroads made transportation of [[materiel]] difficult.<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/>\n\nThe [[Oil Campaign of World War II]] was, however, extremely successful and made a very large contribution to the general collapse of Germany in 1945. In the event, the bombing of oil facilities became [[Albert Speer]]'s main concern; however, this occurred sufficiently late in the war that Germany would soon be defeated in any case.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nGerman insiders credit the Allied bombing offensive with crippling the German war industry. Speer repeatedly said (both during and after the war) it caused crucial production problems. Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], head of the [[U-boat]] fleet (''U-waffe''), noted in his memoirs failure to get the revolutionary [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] U-boats (which could have completely altered the balance of power in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]) into service was entirely the result of the bombing. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)|United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)]], says, despite bombing becoming a major effort, between December 1942 and June 1943, \"The attack on the construction yards and slipways was not heavy enough to be more than troublesome\" and the delays in delivery of Type XXIs and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIIIs]] up until November 1944 \"cannot be attributed to the air attack\",<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/> but adds, \"The attacks during the late winter and early spring of 1945 did close, or all but close, five of the major yards, including the great Blohm and Voss plant at Hamburg\".<ref name=\"anesi.com\"/>\n\n===Effect on morale===\n[[File:Effects of strategic bombing on German morale.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the effects of strategic bombing on German morale in 1945. From the United States [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], Morale Division.]]\n\nAlthough designed to \"break the enemy's will\", the opposite often happened. The British did not crumble under the German [[The Blitz|Blitz]] and other [[strategic bombing|air raids]] early in the war. British workers continued to work throughout the war and food and other basic supplies were available throughout.\n\nThe impact of bombing on German morale was significant according to Professor [[John Buckley (historian)|John Buckley]]. Around a third of the urban population under threat of bombing had no protection at all. Some of the major cities saw 55\u201360 percent of dwellings destroyed. Mass evacuations were a partial answer for six million civilians, but this had a severe effect on morale as German families were split up to live in difficult conditions. By 1944, absenteeism rates of 20\u201325 percent were not unusual and in post-war analysis 91 percent of civilians stated bombing was the most difficult hardship to endure and was the key factor in the collapse of their own morale.<ref name=\"Buckley 1998, p. 166\">Buckley 1998, p. 166.</ref> The United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the bombing was not stiffening morale but seriously depressing it; fatalism, apathy, defeatism were apparent in bombed areas. The ''Luftwaffe'' was blamed for not warding off the attacks and confidence in the Nazi regime fell by 14 percent. By the spring of 1944, some 75 percent of Germans believed the war was lost, owing to the intensity of the bombing.<ref>Kershaw 1987, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\nBuckley argues the German war economy did indeed expand significantly following [[Albert Speer]]'s appointment as Reichsminister of Armaments, \"but it is spurious to argue that because production increased then bombing had no real impact\". The bombing offensive did do serious damage to German production levels. German tank and aircraft production, though reached new records in production levels in 1944, was in particular one-third lower than planned.<ref name=\"Buckley 1998, p. 165\">Buckley 1998, p. 165.</ref> In fact, German aircraft production for 1945 was planned at 80,000, showing Erhard Milch and other leading German planners were pushing for even higher outputs; \"unhindered by Allied bombing German production would have risen far higher\".<ref name=\"Murray 1983, p. 253\">Murray 1983, p. 253.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Max Hastings]] and the authors of the official history of the bomber offensive, [[Noble Frankland]] among them, has argued bombing had a limited effect on morale. In the words of the British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU), \"The essential premise behind the policy of treating towns as unit targets for area attack, namely that the German economic system was fully extended, was false.\" This, the BBSU noted, was because official estimates of German war production were \"more than 100 percent in excess of the true figures\". The BBSU concluded, \"Far from there being any evidence of a cumulative effect on (German) war production, it is evident that, as the (bombing) offensive progressed ... the effect on war production became progressively smaller (and) did not reach significant dimensions.\"<ref>British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU) Report, p.41, paras 137-8, corroborated in United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) report No.31, ''The attack on German cities'' (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1945);{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Noble, Frankland, ''The Bombing Offensive Against Germany: Outlines and Perspectives'', London: Faber 1965, p.114;</ref><ref>Hastings, p. 352, quoting German post-war Statistical Office calculations.</ref>\n\n===Allied bombing statistics 1939\u20131945===\nAccording to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Allied bombers between 1939 and 1945 dropped 1,415,745 tons of bombs over Germany (51.1% of the total bomb tonnage dropped by Allied bombers in the European campaign), 570,730 tons over France (20.6%), 379,565 tons over Italy (13.7%), 185,625 tons over Austria, Hungary and the Balkans (6.7%), and 218,873 tons over other countries (7.9%).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Claudia Baldoli|author2=Andrew Knapp|title=Forgotten Blitzes: France and Italy Under Allied Air Attack, 1940\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFc4K-vPfHUC&pg=PA2|year=2012|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-8581-5|page=2}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|\n<br />\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ RAF Bombing Sorties and Losses 1939\u20131945<ref name = \"Humble\">{{Cite book|last=Humble |first=Richard |title=War in the Air 1939\u20131945 |year=1975 |location=London |publisher=Salamander |oclc=4248555}}</ref>\n!\n!Sorties{{ref|a}}\n!Losses\n|-\n!

Prior to that a single raid was launched from carriers in 1942, and ineffective long-range raids were launched from China from June to December 1944. In the last seven months of the campaign, a change to firebombing resulted in great destruction of 67 Japanese cities, as many as 500,000 Japanese deaths and some 5 million more made homeless. [[Emperor Hirohito]]'s viewing of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945 is said to have been the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] five months later.<ref>Bradley, F.

The raid was a military pinprick but a significant [[propaganda]] victory. Because they were launched prematurely, none of the aircraft had enough fuel to reach their designated landing sites, and so either crashed or ditched (except for one aircraft, which landed in the Soviet Union, where the crew was interned). Two crews were captured by the Japanese.\n\n[[File:Firebombing of Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|Tokyo burns during a [[Firebombing|firebomb]] attack 26 May 1945.]]\n\nThe key development for the bombing of Japan was the [[B-29 Superfortress]], which had an operational range of 1,500 miles (2,400&nbsp;km); almost 90% of the bombs (147,000 tons) dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this bomber. The [[Bombing of Yawata (June 1944)|first raid by B-29s on Japan]] was on 15 June 1944, from China. The B-29s took off from [[Chengdu]], over 1,500 miles away.

Bombing Japan from China was never a satisfactory arrangement because not only were the Chinese airbases difficult to supply\u2014materiel being sent by air from India over \"[[the Hump]]\"\u2014but the B-29s operating from them could only reach Japan if they traded some of their bomb load for extra fuel in tanks in the bomb-bays. When Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]'s [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] campaign captured Pacific islands close enough to Japan to be within the B-29's range, the Twentieth Air Force was assigned to [[XXI Bomber Command]], which organized a much more effective bombing campaign of the Japanese home islands. Based in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] ([[Guam]] and [[Tinian]] in particular), the B-29s were able to carry their full bomb loads and were supplied by cargo ships and tankers. The first raid from the Mariana was on 24 November 1944, when 88 aircraft bombed Tokyo. The bombs were dropped from around 30,000 feet (10,000 m) and it is estimated that only around 10% hit their targets.\n\n[[File:Areas of principal Japanese cities destoyed by US bombing.jpg|left|thumb|Conventional bombs from [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] destroyed over 40% of the urban area in Japan's six greatest industrial cities.]]\nUnlike all other forces in theater, the [[Bomber Command#USAAF|USAAF Bomber Commands]] did not report to the commanders of the theaters but directly to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. In July 1945, they were placed under the [[U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]], which was commanded by General [[Carl Spaatz]].\n\nAs in Europe, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) tried daylight [[precision bombing]]. However, it proved to be impossible due to the weather around Japan, \"during the best month for bombing in Japan, visual bombing was possible for [just] seven days. The worst had only one good day.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Kaplan | first = Fred | authorlink = Fred Kaplan (journalist) | title = The Wizards of Armageddon | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-671-42444-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/wizardsofarmaged00fred }}[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJXu7kMSc44C&pg=PA42 p.42]</ref> Further, bombs dropped from a great height were tossed about by high winds.\n\nGeneral LeMay, commander of XXI Bomber Command, instead switched to mass firebombing night attacks from altitudes of around 7,000 feet (2,100 m) on the major [[conurbation]]s. \"He looked up the size of the large Japanese cities in the ''World Almanac'' and picked his targets accordingly.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Kaplan | first = Fred | title = The Wizards of Armageddon | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-671-42444-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/wizardsofarmaged00fred }}[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJXu7kMSc44C&pg=PA43 p.43]</ref> Priority targets were Tokyo, [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], and [[Kobe]]. Despite limited early success, particularly against Nagoya, LeMay was determined to use such bombing tactics against the vulnerable Japanese cities. Attacks on strategic targets also continued in lower-level daylight raids.\n\nThe first successful [[firebombing]] raid was [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|on Kobe]] on 3 February 1945, and following its relative success the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] continued the tactic. Nearly half of the principal factories of the city were damaged, and production was reduced by more than half at one of the port's two shipyards.\n\n[[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|The first raid of this type on Tokyo]] was on the night of 23\u201324 February when 174 B-29s destroyed around one square mile (3&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the city. Following on that success, as [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Operation Meetinghouse]], 334 B-29s raided on the night of 9\u201310 March, of which 282 Superforts reached their targets, dropping around 1,700 tons of bombs. Around 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the city was destroyed and over 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the [[fire storm]]. It was the most destructive conventional raid, and the deadliest single bombing raid of any kind in terms of lives lost, in all of military aviation history,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2011/03/0309incendiary-bombs-kill-100000-tokyo/ |title=9 March 1945: Burning the Heart Out of the Enemy |date=9 March 2011 |journal=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> even when the missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are taken as single events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/bombings-worse-nagasaki-hiroshima/ |title=Bombings Worse than Nagasaki and Hiroshima |author=Laurence M.

The effects of the Tokyo firebombing proved the fears expressed by Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]] in 1939: \"Japanese cities, being made of wood and paper, would burn very easily. The Army talks big, but if war came and there were large-scale air raids, there's no telling what would happen.\"<ref name=\"Spector\">Spector, Ronald (1985). \"Eagle Against the Sun.\" New York: Vintage Books. p. 503.</ref>\n\n[[File:Tokyo kushu 1945-2.jpg|thumb|left|The charred remains of a woman and her child, after the [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|10 March bombing]] raid on Tokyo]]\n\nIn the following two weeks, there were almost 1,600 further [[sortie]]s against the four cities, destroying 31 square miles (80&nbsp;km\u00b2) in total at a cost of 22 aircraft. By June, over forty percent of the urban area of Japan's largest six cities (Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, [[Yokohama]], and [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]) was devastated. LeMay's fleet of nearly 600 bombers destroyed tens of smaller cities and manufacturing centres in the following weeks and months.\n\nLeaflets were dropped over cities before they were bombed, warning the inhabitants and urging them to escape the city. Though many{{Who|date=January 2017}}, even within the Air Force, viewed this as a form of [[psychological warfare]], a significant element in the decision to produce and drop them was the desire to assuage American anxieties about the extent of the destruction created by this new war tactic. Warning leaflets were also dropped on cities not in fact targeted, to create uncertainty and absenteeism.\n\nA year after the war, the [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)|U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey]] reported that American military officials had underestimated the power of strategic bombing combined with naval blockade and previous military defeats to bring Japan to unconditional surrender without invasion. By July 1945, only a fraction of the planned strategic bombing force had been deployed yet there were few targets left worth the effort. In hindsight, it would have been more effective to use land-based and carrier-based air power to strike merchant shipping and begin aerial mining at a much earlier date so as to link up with effective [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|submarine anti-shipping campaign]] and completely isolate the island nation. This would have accelerated the strangulation of Japan and ended the war sooner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm |title=United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War). 1 July 1946 |publisher=Anesi.com |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> A postwar [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] survey agreed, finding naval mines dropped by B-29s had accounted for 60% of all Japanese shipping losses in the last six months of the war.<ref name=autogenerated2>Hallion, Dr. Richard P.

On 1 April 1945, U.S. troops [[Battle of Okinawa|invaded the island of Okinawa]] and fought there fiercely against not only enemy soldiers, but also enemy civilians. After two and a half months, 12,000 U.S. servicemen, 107,000 Japanese soldiers, and over 150,000 Okinawan civilians (included those forced to fight) were killed. Given the casualty rate in Okinawa, American commanders realized a grisly picture of the intended invasion of mainland Japan. When President [[Harry S. Truman]] was briefed on what would happen during an invasion of Japan, he could not afford such a horrendous casualty rate, added to over 400,000 U.S. servicemen who had already died fighting in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Ham|title=Hiroshima Nagasaki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7hw0x0WEz4C&pg=PA196|year=2012|publisher=Transworld|page=196ff|isbn=9781448126279}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[mushroom cloud]] of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan]], 1945, rose some 18 km (11 mi) above the [[hypocentre]].]]\n\nHoping to forestall the invasion, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China issued a [[Potsdam Declaration]] on 26 July 1945, demanding that the Japanese government accept an [[unconditional surrender]]. The declaration also stated that if Japan did not surrender, it would be faced with \"prompt and utter destruction\", a process which was already underway with the incendiary bombing raids destroying 40% of targeted cities, and by naval warfare isolating and starving Japan of imported food.

Many fools from all around had recourse to him and believed in him implicitly. For three or four generations they had been peddling this same stuff. For a long time I had been thinking that either this false trade should be eliminated or that he should be brought into the embrace of Islam. At length, when Khusraw passed by there, this inconsequential little fellow wished to pay homage to Khusraw. When Khusraw stopped at his residence, [Arjan] came out and had an interview with [Khusraw]. Giving him some elementary spiritual precepts picked up here and there, he made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called ''qashqa'' in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky.

An alternate version highlights the role of a Hindu minister of Jahangir named Chandu Shah. He, in one version, takes revenge on Guru Arjan for not marrying his son Hargobind to Chandu Shah's daughter. In another Lahore version, Chandu Shah actually prevents Guru Arjan from suffering torture and death by Muslims by paying 200,000 rupees (100,000 crusados) to Jahangir, but then keeps him and emotionally torments him to death in his house.<ref>Kirpal Singh (2000), Perspectives on Sikh Gurus, National Book Shop, pp. 125-127</ref> All these versions and meta-narratives became popular in 19th century British colonial literature, such as those of Max Arthur Macauliffe.<ref>Max Arthur Macauliffe (1883), The Sikh Religion: Its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors, {{ISBN|978-8187526032}}, Volume 3</ref> Several alternative versions of the story try to absolve Jahangir and the Mughal empire of any responsibility,<ref name=ps6/><ref>Pashaura Singh (2011), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/11_InResponse.pdf Reconsidering the Sacrifice of Guru Arjan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022617/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/11_InResponse.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}, Journal of Punjab Studies, University of California Press, 18(1&2), pp. 295-316</ref> but have no trace or support in the documentary evidence from early 17th century, such as the records of Jesuit priest Jerome Xavier and the memoirs of Jahangir.<ref name=ps5/><ref name=thackston/><ref>Louis E.

Guru Arjan continued the infrastructure building effort of his father. The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan, financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The pool area grew into a temple complex with the [[gurdwara]] [[Harmandir Sahib]] near the pool.

She seeks revenge on the evil wizard Gardin, Vuan's master, who slaughtered Lemnear's people back when she was a child in the search of a mysterious, prophesized Champion of Silver. Eventually, Lemnear confronts Gardin, but she is knocked out with a magic blast and sent to the city's dungeons, where young girls are retained in order to join Vuan's [[harem]]. There Lemnear learns of the prophecy from an old mage, who tells her the Champion of Silver will turn a Champion of Bronze into Gold and will destroy the evil Barol, the ultimate mastermind behind Gardin and Vuan. In order to rescue a friend from the dungeons, Lemnear infiltrates the harem, but Vuan brainwashes her into becoming another slave. It's thanks to the magic choker that she breaks out and manages to kill Vuan, not without hearding from Gardin that Barol challenges her from his Castle of Valquisas. Upon reaching the castle, she learns of another survivor of her people, Mesh, whom Gardin had believed to be the Champion of Silver and is actually the Champion of Bronze. She fights and kills Gardin, but he turns out to be just the enchanted right arm of Barol. The villain reveals to be a Champion of Gold himself who was raised up by dark powers after his village kicked him out for being a human hybrid. Lemnear and Mesh fight him, defeating both his human and dragon form, but he then turns into a stone giant and moves on to conquer the world. Realizing the prophecy, Lemnear awakes her power through her choker, turns Mesh into a Champion of Gold and they both together destroy Barol's weak spot, killing him for good.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Japanese===\n*[[Eiko Yamada]] - Lemnear\n*[[Keiko Yokozawa]] - Lian\n*[[Ryusei Nakao]] - Mesh\n*[[Akio Ohtsuka]] - Vuan \n*[[Iemasa Kayumi]] - Gardin\n*Nobuo Tanaka - Barol\n*[[Ry\u016bji Saikachi]] - Sendoshi/Old Mage\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n===English===\n*[[Jezabel Montero]] - Lemnear\n*[[Veronica Taylor]] - Lian\n*[[Greg Baglia]] - Mesh\n*[[Bill Rogers (voice actor)|Bill Rogers]] - Vuan \n*[[Bart Shattuck]] - Gardin\n*[[Bill Rogers (voice actor)|Bill Rogers]] - Old Mage\n*[[Harvey Shane]] - Barol\n*[[Wendy Scharfman]] - Mother\n{{col-end}}\n==Reception==\nSimilarities between Lemnear and the Taarakian Taarna from ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', including her sword, hair color, and mode of transportation, were noted by critics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1288 |title=THEM Anime Reviws 4.0 - Legend of Lemnear |access-date=2019-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331132452/http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1288 |archive-date=2019-03-31 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{ann|anime|690|1989 anime}}\n*{{ann|manga|2821|1991 manga}}\n\n{{Anime International Company}}\n\n[[Category:1987 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:1991 manga]]\n[[Category:Anime International Company]]\n[[Category:Central Park Media]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n\n{{anime-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = The Legend of Lemnear\n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| ja_kanji        = \u6975\u9ed2\u306e\u7ffc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\n| ja_romaji       = Kyokkoku no Tsubasa Barukisasu\n| genre           = [[Fantasy]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = ova\n| director        = [[Kinji Yoshimoto]]\n| producer        = Hidenobu Ohyama\n| writer          = \n| music           = Norimasa Yamanaka\n| studio          = [[Anime International Company|AIC]]\n| released        = August 25, 1989\n| runtime         = 45 minutes\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type = manga\n| author = Kinji Yoshimoto\n| illustrator = Satoshi Urushihara\n| publisher = [[Gakken]]\n| publisher_en = {{English manga publisher|NA=[[CPM Manga]]}}\n| magazine = Comic Nora\n| demographic = ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|Sh\u014dnen]]''\n| first = September 1991\n| last = February 1993\n| volumes = 3\n| volume_list =\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Legend of Lemnear'''''|\u6975\u9ed2\u306e\u7ffc \u30d0\u30eb\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9|Kyokkoku no Tsubasa Barukisasu|\"Wings of Absolute Darkness: Valquisas\"}} is an [[anime]] [[OVA]] directed by [[Kinji Yoshimoto]] with character designs by [[Satoshi Urushihara]], produced by [[Anime International Company|AIC]].

There Lemnear finds about the prophecy from an old mage, who tells her the Champion of Silver will turn a Champion of Bronze into Gold and will destroy the evil Barol, the ultimate mastermind behind Gardin and Vuan. In order to rescue a friend from the dungeons, Lemnear infiltrates the harem, but Vuan brainwashes her into becoming another slave. It's thanks to the magic choker that she breaks out and manages to kill Vuan, not without hearding from Gardin that Barol challenges her from his Castle of Valquisas. Upon reaching the castle, she learns of another survivor of her people, Mesh, whom Gardin had believed to be the Champion of Silver and is actually the Champion of Bronze. She fights and kills Gardin, but he turns out to be just the enchanted right arm of Barol. The villain reveals to be a Champion of Gold himself who was raised up by dark powers after his village kicked him out for being a human hybrid. Lemnear and Mesh fight him, defeating both his human and dragon form, but he then turns into a stone giant and moves on to conquer the world. Realizing the prophecy, Lemnear awakes her power through her choker, turns Mesh into a Champion of Gold and they both together destroy Barol's weak spot, killing him for good.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Japanese===\n*[[Eiko Yamada]] - Lemnear\n*[[Keiko Yokozawa]] - Lian\n*[[Ryusei Nakao]] - Mesh\n*[[Akio Ohtsuka]] - Vuan \n*[[Iemasa Kayumi]] - Gardin\n*Nobuo Tanaka - Barol\n*[[Ry\u016bji Saikachi]] - Sendoshi/Old Mage\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n===English===\n*[[Jezabel Montero]] - Lemnear\n*[[Veronica Taylor]] - Lian\n*[[Greg Baglia]] - Mesh\n*[[Bill Rogers (voice actor)|Bill Rogers]] - Vuan \n*[[Bart Shattuck]] - Gardin\n*[[Bill Rogers (voice actor)|Bill Rogers]] - Old Mage\n*[[Harvey Shane]] - Barol\n*[[Wendy Scharfman]] - Mother\n{{col-end}}\n==Reception==\nSimilarities between Lemnear and the Taarakian Taarna from ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', including her sword, hair color, and mode of transportation, were noted by critics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1288 |title=THEM Anime Reviws 4.0 - Legend of Lemnear |access-date=2019-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331132452/http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1288 |archive-date=2019-03-31 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{ann|anime|690|1989 anime}}\n*{{ann|manga|2821|1991 manga}}\n\n{{Anime International Company}}\n\n[[Category:1987 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:1991 manga]]\n[[Category:Anime International Company]]\n[[Category:Central Park Media]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n\n{{anime-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Black Walnut", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot summary:syntax: \u00a8finds about\u00a8 -> \u00a8learns of\u00a8", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Lemnear"}
