Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

The Lemberg Fortress fell on 3 September.

For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union.

Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Examples include the main building of [[Lviv Academy of Commerce]], the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} One monument of the Polish past is the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]] at the square bearing his name.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by [[Jan Piotr Norblin]], [[Marceleo Bacciarelli]], [[Kazimierz Wojniakowski]], [[Antoni Brodowski]], [[Henryk Rodakowski]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Aleksander Gierymski]], [[Jan Stanis\u0142awski (painter)|Jan Stanis\u0142awski]], [[Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski]], [[J\u00f3zef Che\u0142mo\u0144ski]], [[J\u00f3zef Mehoffer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski]], [[Olga Bozna\u0144ska]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw S\u0142owi\u0144ski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the [[Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land]].\n\nAccording to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=T\u00f6rnquist-Plewa |editor1-first=Barbara |title=Whose Memory?

Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated at 1,100. A number of organisations continue to be active.\n\nThe [[Sholem Aleichem]] Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the [[ghetto]] in 1988.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others).

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]]. In 2006\u20132008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled.

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with capital in Lw\u00f3w. On 17 June 1356 King [[Casimir III the Great]] granted it [[Magdeburg rights]]. In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

On the night of 31 October\u20131 November 1918 the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen|Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi)]], which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv.

Following Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937\u20131938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Ma\u0142y Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]], the eastern part of the Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland.

Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country.

The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR.

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\n=== Theatre and opera ===\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430.JPG|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]\n\nIn 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.\n\nIn the [[Janowska concentration camp]], the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. To do so they brought almost the whole Lviv National Opera to the camp. Professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. From 1941 to 1944 the Nazis massacred 200,000 people including all 40 musicians<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baranovskiy|first=Mikhail|title=Tango of Death. A True Story of a Holocaust Survivors|publisher=Mr. Mintz Publishing|year=2020|isbn=979-8620147014|location=USA|pages=https://www.amazon.com/Tango-Death-Story-Holocaust-Survivors/dp/B085HHMGMT/}}</ref>.\n\nNowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Boh\u00e8me'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]\n\nThe most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n=== Music ===\nLviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the [[Lviv Conservatory]], and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych|Stanislav Liudkevych]], [[Wojciech Kilar]] and [[Mykola Kolessa]].\n\nFlute virtuoso and composer [[Franz Doppler|Albert Franz Doppler]] (1821\u20131883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist [[Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski]] (1892\u20131993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"''[[Polish Radio Lw\u00f3w]]''\" was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] \u2013 Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]\nPopular throughout Poland was the [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Comic Lw\u00f3w Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski]], the actor [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer]] and [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (\"''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and To\u0144ko\" and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]].

Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866\u20131938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanis\u0142aw G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski]] had served as dean of the law department (1889\u20131890) and as the University rector (1908\u20131909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lw\u00f3w]].\n\nIn 1873 in Lviv was founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.\n\nIn 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lw\u00f3w which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nLviv was the home of the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems.

They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.\n\n* [[Ivan Franko Park]], is the oldest park in the city. Traces of that time may be found in three- hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the abrogation of the Jesuit order in 1773 the territory became the town property.

Opera and Ballet Theatre in background]]\nThe first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lw\u00f3w-Krak\u00f3w game. The goal was scored by [[W\u0142odzimierz Chomicki]] who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanis\u0142aw Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Federation]] was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, [[Czarni Lw\u00f3w]] opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogo\u0144, in 1913. Another club, [[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogo\u0144, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). [[Hasmonea Lw\u00f3w|Hasmonea]] was the first Jewish football club in Poland.

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students).

This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts.

The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled. The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\n=== Railways ===\n{{Main|Lviv Railways}}\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432, \u0437\u0430\u043b. \u0434\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0435\u0446\u044c (\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b), \u0414\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043b.jpg|thumb|Lviv's [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Main Railway Terminal]]]]\nModern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge providing local and international services. Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of [[cycling infrastructure]]<ref>[http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf Lviv City Administration \u2013 Bicycle Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123621/http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> \u2013 until the year 2019 an overall length of {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=on}} cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeday.org.ua |title=bikeday.org.ua |publisher=bikeday.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> or the [[European Mobility Week]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilnist.org.ua/en/downloads/doc_download/43-european-mobility-week-2011-in-lvivukraine.html |title=Downloads &#124; Event Reports |publisher=Mobilnist.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> show the popularity of cycling among Lviv's citizens.\n\nBy September 2011, {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of the 2011 {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv \u2013 the first such position in Ukraine \u2013 is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.\n\nIn 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] \u2013 the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{convert|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|List of universities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Lvivska politehnika2013.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lviv Polytechnic]] National University.]]\nLviv is an important education centre of Ukraine. The city contains a total of 12 [[university|universities]], 8 academies and a number of smaller schools of higher education. In addition, within Lviv, there is a total of eight institutes of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|National Academy of Science of Ukraine]] and more than forty [[research institute]]s. These research institutes include the [[Lviv Centre of Institute for Space Research|Centre of Institute for Space Research]]; the Institute for [[Condensed Matter Physics]]; the Institute of [[Cell Biology]]; the National Institute of Strategic Studies; the Institute of Neuro-mathematical Simulation in Power Engineering; and the Institute of Ecology of the Carpathians.\n\nIn [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city of Lviv was the location where the software for the [[Lunokhod]] programme was developed. The technology for the [[Venera]] series probes and the first orbital shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] were also developed in Lviv.\n\nA considerable scientific potential is concentrated in the city: by the number of doctors of sciences, candidates of sciences, scientific organisations Lviv is the fourth city in Ukraine. Lviv is also known for ancient academic traditions, founded by the Assumption Brotherhood School and the Jesuit Collegium. Over 100,000 students annually study in more than 50 higher educational establishments.\n\n'''Educational level of residents''':<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141205154901/http://www.city-institute.org/en/Socio/Social_portrait_Eng.jpg Social portrait of Lviv resident]</ref>\n\n* Basic and complete secondary education: 10%\n* Specialized secondary education: 25%\n* Incomplete higher education (undergraduates): 13%\n* Higher education (graduates): 51%\n* Ph.D. (postgraduates): about 1%\n\n=== Universities ===\n[[File:52 Pekarska Street, Lviv (03).jpg|thumb|Anatomy Department Building of [[Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University]] - one of the oldest and prime medical institute of Ukraine.]]\n* [[Lviv University|Ivan Franko National University of Lviv]] (ukr.
