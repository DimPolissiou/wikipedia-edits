In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] [[Karl Bonhoeffer]], noted for his criticism of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and his mother Paula Bonhoeffer, n\u00e9e von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter [[Stanislaus von  Kalckreuth]]. Bonhoeffer's family dynamic and his parents values enabled him to receive a high level of education and also encouraged his curiosity, which in turn impacted his ability to lead others around him, specifically in the church setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forged In Crisis: The Making of Five Courageous Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2003|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=New York, NY|pages=287}}</ref> His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I, when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was a lawyer until he was executed for his involvement in the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn | Bonhoeffer | Barnett | Schulz | 2011 | p=581}}{{sfn | Bethge | Barnett | 1999 | p=18,625}}{{sfn | Root | 2014 | p=119}} \n\nBoth of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-G\u00fcnther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nBonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [[Berlin University]] in 1927, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''.\n\n=== Studies in America ===\nStill too young to be ordained, at the age of twenty-four Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards (\"There is no theology here.\"),<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\">David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 45</ref> he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow-seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught [[Sunday school]] and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell Sr.]] preach the Gospel of Social Justice, and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities, but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}</ref> \n\nBonhoeffer began to see things \"from below\"\u2014from the perspective of those who suffer oppression. He observed, \"Here one can truly speak and hear about sin and grace and the love of God...the Black Christ is preached with rapturous passion and vision.\" Later Bonhoeffer referred to his impressions abroad as the point at which he \"turned from phraseology to reality.\"<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\" /> He also learned to drive an automobile, although he failed the driving test three times.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=[[Mark Galli|Galli, Mark]] and Barbara | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3202.html |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You bbqs are nice?| journal=Christian History| issue =32| date=1991}}</ref> He borrowed a 1924 Oldsmobile sedan from a member of the Greenville Community Church in Westchester County in order to drive to Mexico. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.greenvillechurch.org/dietrich-bohnoeffer-friend-of-greenville-community-church|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, friend of Greenville Community Church|website=Greenville Community Church|language=en-US|access-date=18 October 2019}} </ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0211-316, Dietrich Bonhoeffer mit Sch\u00fclern.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer on a weekend getaway with [[Confirmand#Protestant views|confirmands]] of Zion's Church congregation (1932)<ref>''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, pp. 31, 33. No ISBN.</ref>]]\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in [[systematic theology]] at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in [[ecumenism]], he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.<ref name=\"Michael Balfour p216\">Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 216</ref> On 15 November 1931\u2014at the age of 25\u2014he was ordained at [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] {{ill|St. Matthew, Berlin-Tiergarten|de|Matth\u00e4uskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthew}} in Berlin-Tiergarten.\n\n=== Confessing Church ===\nBonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with the Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''F\u00fchrer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verf\u00fchrer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp. 259\u201360</ref> In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply \"bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam a spoke in the wheel itself.\"<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 38</ref>\n\nIn November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for [[presbyter]]s and [[synod]]als (church officials) of the German ''Landeskirche'' (Protestant historical established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers\u2014a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.\n\nDespite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.<ref>Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p. 72</ref> The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted \"intact churches,\" as opposed to the other so-called \"destroyed churches.\"\n\nIn opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.<ref>{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.</ref> In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the [[Bethel Institution|Bethel Confession]],<ref name=\"Obendiek 1992 57\">Enno Obendiek, \u201eDie Theologische Erkl\u00e4rung von Barmen 1934: Hinf\u00fchrung\u201c, in: ''\u201e\u2026 den gro\u00dfen Zwecken des Christenthums gem\u00e4\u00df\u201c: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung f\u00fcr die Gemeinden'', Wilhelm H\u00fcffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp.&nbsp;52\u201358 [57]. {{ISBN|3-7858-0346-X}}</ref> a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's fidelity to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 47</ref>\n\nIn September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.<ref>Robert P.

He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, \"I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'\" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his \"splendid theological armory\" while \"the house of your church is on fire,\" and chided him to return to Berlin \"by the next ship.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933\u20131935'', p. 40</ref>\n\nBonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niem\u00f6ller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Heckel|de}}\u2014the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs\u2014traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom,'' ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Underground seminaries ===\nIn 1935, Bonhoeffer was offered a well-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]]. However, remembering Barth's rebuke, Bonhoeffer decided to return to Germany instead, where he was the head at an underground seminary in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]] for training Confessing Church pastors.  As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niem\u00f6ller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a \"[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state\" by Theodor Heckel.[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in [[Ruth von Kleist-Retzow]]. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, [[Maria von Wedemeyer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]],'' a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked \"cheap grace\" as a cover for ethical laxity, but also preached \"costly grace.\"\n\nBonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct \"seminary on the run\" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary on its estate of [[S\u0142onowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz]]. The pastors of Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's ''Letters and Papers from Prison'') as vicars in their congregations.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\">''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, S\u0142awno County|Wendish Tychow]].

As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army, though not to do so was potentially a [[capital offense]]. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\" />\n\nIt was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]:\n{{quote|I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America.

In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the [[Abwehr]], a German military intelligence organization. Dohn\u00e1nyi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.<ref name=nyrb /> Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohn\u00e1nyi, who was actively involved in the planning.<ref name=nyrb>{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}</ref> In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that \"the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1997) ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' . New York: Touchstone. p. 7.</ref> He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote, \"When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p. 244</ref> (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, \"The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.\"<ref>Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p. 155</ref>)\n\nUnder cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.<ref>Slack, \"George Bell\", SCM, 1971, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Dohn\u00e1nyi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohn\u00e1nyi were arrested and imprisoned.\n\n=== Imprisonment ===\nOn 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=289|via=}}</ref> A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18.

There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and \"disappear\" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi, who were also imprisoned.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bonhoeffer,  Dietrich & Kelly, Geffrey B.

He was transferred from the military prison Tegel in Berlin, where he had been held for 18 months, to the detention cellar of the house prison of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Security Head Office]], the Gestapo's high-security prison.

His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about \"religionless Christianity\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/nones-dones-and-religionless-christianity-part-1 | title=Nones, Dones and Religionless Christianity, Part 1}}</ref> are emphasized by liberal Protestants.\n\nCentral to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world \"in terms of two spheres\"\u2014an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of [[imitation of Christ]]. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.<ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p. 835</ref> Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, \"had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world\" if it were to be a true church of Christ.\n\nIn his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a \"world come of age,\" where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a \"religionless Christianity,\" where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion, which he called the \"garment\" of faith. Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.\n\nYears after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the \"[[Death of God theology|Death of God]]\" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics\u2014such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others\u2014have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.giovaniemissione.it/categoria-testimoni/2174/ezechiele-ramin/#biografia\n|title=La vita di Lele\n|language=it\n|publisher=Giovani e Missione\n|date=\n|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cori>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032001/http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 22 March 2012\n |title      = Ezechiele Ramin\n |language   = it\n |author     = Piera Cori\n |publisher  = Alla Tua Presenza\n |date       = 13 July 2010\n |accessdate = 31 March 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nEnglish translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available.

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.\n* ''Act and Being. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 2''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Wayne Whitson Floyd and Hans Richard Reuter, Editors; Translated by H. Martin Rumscheidt. Hardcover, 256 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8302-3}}. Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929\u20131930 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation's insight into the origin sinfulness in the \"heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.\" Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.\n* ''Creation and Fall. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 3''.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John W. De Gruchy, Editor Translated by Douglas Stephen Bax. In 1932, Bonhoeffer called on his students at the University of Berlin to focus their attention on the word of God, the word of truth, in a time of turmoil.

Dodsey and Geffrey B. Kelly, Editors. Originally published in 1937, this book (generally known in English by the title ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'') soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government.

''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community. ''Prayerbook of the Bible'' is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for ''Christian prayer''. In this theological interpretation of the Psalms, Bonhoeffer describes the moods of an individual's relationship with God and also the turns of love and heartbreak, of joy and sorrow, that are themselves the Christian community's path to God.\n* ''Ethics. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 6''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Clifford Green, Editor; Translated by Reinhard Krauss, Douglas W. Stott, and Charles C. West.

Hardcover, 288 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8307-8}}. Writing fiction\u2014an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story\u2014occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fianc\u00e9e and dealing with his interrogation. \"There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,\" he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison.

The seminary existed for two years before the Gestapo ordered it closed in August 1937. The two years of Finkenwalde's existence produced some of Bonhoeffer's most significant theological work as he prepared these young seminarians for the turbulence and risk of parish ministry in the Confessing Church. Bonhoeffer and his seminarians were under Gestapo surveillance; some of them were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout, he remained dedicated to training them for the ministry and its challenges in a difficult time. This volume includes bible studies, sermons, and lectures on homiletics, pastoral care, and catechesis, giving a moving and up-close portrait of the Confessing Church in these crucial years\u2014the same period during which Bonhoeffer wrote his classics, Discipleship and Life Together.''\"<ref name=\"store.fortresspress.com\">{{Citation|url=http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |title=Theological Education at Finkenwalde: 1935\u20131937 |first=Dietrich |last=Bonhoeffer |series=Works |volume=14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404114641/http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |archivedate=4 April 2014  }}.</ref>\n* ''Theological Education Underground: 1937\u20131940, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Works, Volume 15'', is a translation of Illegale Theologenausbildung: 1937\u20131940.

Touchstone edition with introduction by [[Bishop George Bell]] and memoir by G. Leibholz, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81500-1}}. Critical edition published under its original title ''Discipleship'': John D. Godsey (editor); Geffrey B. Kelly (editor). Fortress Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8006-8324-2}}. Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, \"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.\" That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church. First published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers\u2014and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.\n* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the \"Brother's House\" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954. Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: {{ISBN|0-06-060852-8}}\n* ''Ethics'' (1955 in English by SCM Press). Touchstone edition, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}. This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the ''Ethics'' which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press). This edition translated by [[Reginald H. Fuller]] and Frank Clark from ''Widerstand und Ergebung: Briefe und Aufzeichnungen aus der Haft''. Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag (1970). Touchstone 1997 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-83827-3}}. In hundreds of letters, including letters written to his fianc\u00e9e, Maria von Wedemeyer (selected from the complete correspondence, previously published as ''Love Letters from Cell 92'' Ruth-Alice von Bismarck and Ulrich Kabitz (editors), Abingdon Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-687-01098-5}}), as well as official documents, short original pieces, and a few final sermons, the volume sheds light on Bonhoeffer's active resistance to and increasing involvement in the conspiracy against the Hitler regime; his arrest; and his long imprisonment. Finally, Bonhoeffer's many exchanges with his family, fianc\u00e9e, and closest friends, demonstrate the affection and solidarity that accompanied Bonhoeffer to his prison cell, concentration camp, and eventual death.\n* ''A Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer'' (1990).

In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] [[Karl Bonhoeffer]], noted for his criticism of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and his mother Paula Bonhoeffer, n\u00e9e von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter [[Stanislaus von  Kalckreuth]]. Bonhoeffer's family dynamic and his parents values enabled him to receive a high level of education and also encouraged his curiosity, which in turn impacted his ability to lead others around him, specifically in the church setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forged In Crisis: The Making of Five Courageous Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2003|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=New York, NY|pages=287}}</ref> His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I, when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was a lawyer until he was executed for his involvement in the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn | Bonhoeffer | Barnett | Schulz | 2011 | p=581}}{{sfn | Bethge | Barnett | 1999 | p=18,625}}{{sfn | Root | 2014 | p=119}} \n\nBoth of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-G\u00fcnther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nBonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [[Berlin University]] in 1927, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''.\n\n=== Studies in America ===\nStill too young to be ordained, at the age of twenty-four Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards (\"There is no theology here.\"),<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\">David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 45</ref> he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow-seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught [[Sunday school]] and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell Sr.]] preach the Gospel of Social Justice, and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities, but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}</ref> \n\nBonhoeffer began to see things \"from below\"\u2014from the perspective of those who suffer oppression. He observed, \"Here one can truly speak and hear about sin and grace and the love of God...the Black Christ is preached with rapturous passion and vision.\" Later Bonhoeffer referred to his impressions abroad as the point at which he \"turned from phraseology to reality.\"<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\" /> He also learned to drive an automobile, although he failed the driving test three times.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=[[Mark Galli|Galli, Mark]] and Barbara | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3202.html |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You Know?| journal=Christian History| issue =32| date=1991}}</ref> He borrowed a 1924 Oldsmobile sedan from a member of the Greenville Community Church in Westchester County in order to drive to Mexico. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.greenvillechurch.org/dietrich-bohnoeffer-friend-of-greenville-community-church|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, friend of Greenville Community Church|website=Greenville Community Church|language=en-US|access-date=18 October 2019}} </ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0211-316, Dietrich Bonhoeffer mit Sch\u00fclern.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer on a weekend getaway with [[Confirmand#Protestant views|confirmands]] of Zion's Church congregation (1932)<ref>''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, pp. 31, 33. No ISBN.</ref>]]\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in [[systematic theology]] at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in [[ecumenism]], he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.<ref name=\"Michael Balfour p216\">Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 216</ref> On 15 November 1931\u2014at the age of 25\u2014he was ordained at [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] {{ill|St. Matthew, Berlin-Tiergarten|de|Matth\u00e4uskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthew}} in Berlin-Tiergarten.\n\n=== Confessing Church ===\nBonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with the Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''F\u00fchrer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verf\u00fchrer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp. 259\u201360</ref> In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply \"bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam a spoke in the wheel itself.\"<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 38</ref>\n\nIn November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for [[presbyter]]s and [[synod]]als (church officials) of the German ''Landeskirche'' (Protestant historical established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers\u2014a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.\n\nDespite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.<ref>Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p. 72</ref> The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted \"intact churches,\" as opposed to the other so-called \"destroyed churches.\"\n\nIn opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.<ref>{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.</ref> In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the [[Bethel Institution|Bethel Confession]],<ref name=\"Obendiek 1992 57\">Enno Obendiek, \u201eDie Theologische Erkl\u00e4rung von Barmen 1934: Hinf\u00fchrung\u201c, in: ''\u201e\u2026 den gro\u00dfen Zwecken des Christenthums gem\u00e4\u00df\u201c: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung f\u00fcr die Gemeinden'', Wilhelm H\u00fcffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp.&nbsp;52\u201358 [57]. {{ISBN|3-7858-0346-X}}</ref> a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's fidelity to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 47</ref>\n\nIn September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.<ref>Robert P.

He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, \"I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'\" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his \"splendid theological armory\" while \"the house of your church is on fire,\" and chided him to return to Berlin \"by the next ship.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933\u20131935'', p. 40</ref>\n\nBonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niem\u00f6ller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Heckel|de}}\u2014the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs\u2014traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom,'' ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Underground seminaries ===\nIn 1935, Bonhoeffer was offered a well-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]]. However, remembering Barth's rebuke, Bonhoeffer decided to return to Germany instead, where he was the head at an underground seminary in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]] for training Confessing Church pastors.  As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niem\u00f6ller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a \"[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state\" by Theodor Heckel.[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in [[Ruth von Kleist-Retzow]]. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, [[Maria von Wedemeyer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]],'' a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked \"cheap grace\" as a cover for ethical laxity, but also preached \"costly grace.\"\n\nBonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct \"seminary on the run\" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary on its estate of [[S\u0142onowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz]]. The pastors of Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's ''Letters and Papers from Prison'') as vicars in their congregations.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\">''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, S\u0142awno County|Wendish Tychow]]. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the seminary there following the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\" /> Bonhoeffer's monastic communal life and teaching at Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, ''The Cost of Discipleship'' and ''Life Together.''\n\nBonhoeffer's sister, Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in September 1940.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html | publisher = PBS | title = Bonhoeffer | contribution = Timeline}}.</ref>\n\n=== Return to the United States ===\nIn February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the [[German Resistance]] when his brother-in-law [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]] introduced him to a group seeking Hitler's overthrow at [[Abwehr]], the German military intelligence service.\n\nBonhoeffer also learned from Dohn\u00e1nyi that war was imminent and was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army, though not to do so was potentially a [[capital offense]]. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\" />\n\nIt was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]:\n{{quote|I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America.

In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the [[Abwehr]], a German military intelligence organization. Dohn\u00e1nyi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.<ref name=nyrb /> Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohn\u00e1nyi, who was actively involved in the planning.<ref name=nyrb>{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}</ref> In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that \"the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1997) ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' . New York: Touchstone. p. 7.</ref> He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote, \"When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p. 244</ref> (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, \"The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.\"<ref>Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p. 155</ref>)\n\nUnder cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.<ref>Slack, \"George Bell\", SCM, 1971, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Dohn\u00e1nyi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohn\u00e1nyi were arrested and imprisoned.\n\n=== Imprisonment ===\nOn 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=289|via=}}</ref> A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18.

There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and \"disappear\" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi, who were also imprisoned.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bonhoeffer,  Dietrich & Kelly, Geffrey B.

He was transferred from the military prison Tegel in Berlin, where he had been held for 18 months, to the detention cellar of the house prison of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Security Head Office]], the Gestapo's high-security prison.

His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about \"religionless Christianity\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/nones-dones-and-religionless-christianity-part-1 | title=Nones, Dones and Religionless Christianity, Part 1}}</ref> are emphasized by liberal Protestants.\n\nCentral to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world \"in terms of two spheres\"\u2014an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of [[imitation of Christ]]. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.<ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p. 835</ref> Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, \"had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world\" if it were to be a true church of Christ.\n\nIn his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a \"world come of age,\" where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a \"religionless Christianity,\" where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion, which he called the \"garment\" of faith. Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.\n\nYears after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the \"[[Death of God theology|Death of God]]\" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics\u2014such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others\u2014have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.giovaniemissione.it/categoria-testimoni/2174/ezechiele-ramin/#biografia\n|title=La vita di Lele\n|language=it\n|publisher=Giovani e Missione\n|date=\n|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cori>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032001/http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 22 March 2012\n |title      = Ezechiele Ramin\n |language   = it\n |author     = Piera Cori\n |publisher  = Alla Tua Presenza\n |date       = 13 July 2010\n |accessdate = 31 March 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nEnglish translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available.

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.\n* ''Act and Being.

Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929\u20131930 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation's insight into the origin sinfulness in the \"heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.\" Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.\n* ''Creation and Fall. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 3''.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John W. De Gruchy, Editor Translated by Douglas Stephen Bax. In 1932, Bonhoeffer called on his students at the University of Berlin to focus their attention on the word of God, the word of truth, in a time of turmoil.

Dodsey and Geffrey B. Kelly, Editors.

''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community. ''Prayerbook of the Bible'' is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for ''Christian prayer''. In this theological interpretation of the Psalms, Bonhoeffer describes the moods of an individual's relationship with God and also the turns of love and heartbreak, of joy and sorrow, that are themselves the Christian community's path to God.\n* ''Ethics.

Hardcover, 288 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8307-8}}. Writing fiction\u2014an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story\u2014occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fianc\u00e9e and dealing with his interrogation. \"There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,\" he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison.

The seminary existed for two years before the Gestapo ordered it closed in August 1937. The two years of Finkenwalde's existence produced some of Bonhoeffer's most significant theological work as he prepared these young seminarians for the turbulence and risk of parish ministry in the Confessing Church. Bonhoeffer and his seminarians were under Gestapo surveillance; some of them were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout, he remained dedicated to training them for the ministry and its challenges in a difficult time. This volume includes bible studies, sermons, and lectures on homiletics, pastoral care, and catechesis, giving a moving and up-close portrait of the Confessing Church in these crucial years\u2014the same period during which Bonhoeffer wrote his classics, Discipleship and Life Together.''\"<ref name=\"store.fortresspress.com\">{{Citation|url=http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |title=Theological Education at Finkenwalde: 1935\u20131937 |first=Dietrich |last=Bonhoeffer |series=Works |volume=14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404114641/http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |archivedate=4 April 2014  }}.</ref>\n* ''Theological Education Underground: 1937\u20131940, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Works, Volume 15'', is a translation of Illegale Theologenausbildung: 1937\u20131940.

Touchstone edition with introduction by [[Bishop George Bell]] and memoir by G. Leibholz, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81500-1}}. Critical edition published under its original title ''Discipleship'': John D. Godsey (editor); Geffrey B. Kelly (editor). Fortress Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8006-8324-2}}. Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, \"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.\" That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church. First published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers\u2014and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.\n* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the \"Brother's House\" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954.

This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the ''Ethics'' which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press).

Touchstone 1997 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-83827-3}}. In hundreds of letters, including letters written to his fianc\u00e9e, Maria von Wedemeyer (selected from the complete correspondence, previously published as ''Love Letters from Cell 92'' Ruth-Alice von Bismarck and Ulrich Kabitz (editors), Abingdon Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-687-01098-5}}), as well as official documents, short original pieces, and a few final sermons, the volume sheds light on Bonhoeffer's active resistance to and increasing involvement in the conspiracy against the Hitler regime; his arrest; and his long imprisonment. Finally, Bonhoeffer's many exchanges with his family, fianc\u00e9e, and closest friends, demonstrate the affection and solidarity that accompanied Bonhoeffer to his prison cell, concentration camp, and eventual death.\n* ''A Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer'' (1990).

According to Muslim accounts, this chapter was [[Revelation|revealed]] to Muhammad when his tribe, [[Quraysh]], sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them \"about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story\". \"If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.\" (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope=\"row\"|18:83-98]]).\n\nThe verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhu al-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Verse\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"45%\" | [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"45%\" | [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 18:83.\n|They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain Say, \"I will rehearse to you something of his story.\"\n|They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn.

According to these, the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The legend went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}\n\nThe reasons behind the name \"Two-Horned\" are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity (\"horn\") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall Dhu al-Qarnayn builds on his northern journey may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the \"Land of Gog and Magog\" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glass\u00e9|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nDhu al-Qarnayn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities (\"qarns\", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} Ernst claims that Dhu al-Qarnayn finding the sun setting in a \"muddy spring\" in the West is equivalent to the \"poisonous sea\" found by Alexander in the Syriac legend. In the Syriac story Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran allegedly changes this into a general administration of justice. In the East both the Syrian legend and the Quran, according to Ernst, have Alexander/Dhu al-Qarnayn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}\n\n\"Qarn\" also means \"period\" or \"century\", and the name Dhu al-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as \"He of the Two Ages\", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glass\u00e9|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}\n\nSeveral notable Muslim commentators, including [[Ibn Kathir]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://ia800604.us.archive.org/13/items/Qasas-ul-QuranByShaykhHifzurRahmanSeoharvir.a/Qasas-ul-Quran-volume34-ByShaykhHifzurRahmanSeoharvir.a.pdf|title=Qasas-ul-Qur'an|last=Seoharwi|first=Muhammad Hifzur Rahman|volume=3|author-link=Muhammad Hifzur Rahman Seoharwi}}</ref><sup>:100-101</sup> [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]<ref name=\":2\" /><sup>:101</sup><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.sunnahfollowers.net/library/books/The%20Criterion%20Between%20The%20Allies%20Of%20the%20Merciful%20&%20The%20Allies%20Of%20the%20Devil.pdf|title=\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0646 - \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0670\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0637\u0670\u0646|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|publisher=Idara Ahya-us-Sunnah|pages=14|translator-last=Ibn Morgan|translator-first=Salim Adballah|trans-title=The Criterion - Between Allies of the Merciful & The Allies of the Devil|author-link=Ibn Taymiyyah}}</ref> and [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://tafseerenamoona.net/topicResult/2341|title=Tafseer-e-Namoona|last=Shirazi|first=Naser Makarem|author-link=Naser Makarem Shirazi}}</ref>, have strongly disagreed with the Alexander identification.

In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, 1058\u20131111) wrote of how Dhu al-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}\n\nThe [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhu al-Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the \"mother\" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhu al-Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhu al-Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}\n\nThe Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,<ref>Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60</ref> from Iskandar Zulkarnain,<ref name=\"(Malaysia)1999\">{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu & kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}</ref> through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.<ref name=\"TasaiDjamari2005\">{{cite book |author1=S.

The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them \"about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story\". \"If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.\" (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope=\"row\"|18:83-98]]).\n\nThe verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhu al-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Verse\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"45%\" | [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"45%\" | [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 18:83.\n|They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain Say, \"I will rehearse to you something of his story.\"\n|They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn.

According to these, the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The legend went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}\n\nThe reasons behind the name \"Two-Horned\" are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity (\"horn\") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall Dhu al-Qarnayn builds on his northern journey may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the \"Land of Gog and Magog\" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glass\u00e9|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nDhu al-Qarnayn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities (\"qarns\", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} Ernst claims that Dhu al-Qarnayn finding the sun setting in a \"muddy spring\" in the West is equivalent to the \"poisonous sea\" found by Alexander in the Syriac legend. In the Syriac story Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran allegedly changes this into a general administration of justice. In the East both the Syrian legend and the Quran, according to Ernst, have Alexander/Dhu al-Qarnayn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}\n\n\"Qarn\" also means \"period\" or \"century\", and the name Dhu al-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as \"He of the Two Ages\", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glass\u00e9|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}\n\nSeveral notable Muslim commentators, including [[Ibn Kathir]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://ia800604.us.archive.org/13/items/Qasas-ul-QuranByShaykhHifzurRahmanSeoharvir.a/Qasas-ul-Quran-volume34-ByShaykhHifzurRahmanSeoharvir.a.pdf|title=Qasas-ul-Qur'an|last=Seoharwi|first=Muhammad Hifzur Rahman|volume=3|author-link=Muhammad Hifzur Rahman Seoharwi}}</ref><sup>:100-101</sup> [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]<ref name=\":2\" /><sup>:101</sup><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.sunnahfollowers.net/library/books/The%20Criterion%20Between%20The%20Allies%20Of%20the%20Merciful%20&%20The%20Allies%20Of%20the%20Devil.pdf|title=\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0646 - \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0670\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0637\u0670\u0646|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|publisher=Idara Ahya-us-Sunnah|pages=14|translator-last=Ibn Morgan|translator-first=Salim Adballah|trans-title=The Criterion - Between Allies of the Merciful & The Allies of the Devil|author-link=Ibn Taymiyyah}}</ref> and [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://tafseerenamoona.net/topicResult/2341|title=Tafseer-e-Namoona|last=Shirazi|first=Naser Makarem|author-link=Naser Makarem Shirazi}}</ref>, have strongly disagreed with the Alexander identification. Among Western academics, Brannon Wheeler has argued that the alleged similarities between Alexander romances and the Dhu al-Qarnayn story are actually based on later commentaries of the Qur'an rather than the Qur'an itself.<ref name=\":1\" /><sup>:16, 18-19</sup>\n\n===Later literature===\n\nDhu al-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, 1058\u20131111) wrote of how Dhu al-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}\n\nThe [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhu al-Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the \"mother\" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhu al-Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhu al-Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}\n\nThe Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,<ref>Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60</ref> from Iskandar Zulkarnain,<ref name=\"(Malaysia)1999\">{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu & kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}</ref> through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.<ref name=\"TasaiDjamari2005\">{{cite book |author1=S.

whereas Dhu al-Qarnayn (according to some) lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Dhu al-Qarnayn worshipped [[Allah|only one God]], while Alexander was a polytheist, proudly referring to

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions.

B Paki was attributed a try while \"Paki\" scored 2 tries, while for Ponsonby L Cadman scored 1, A Cadman scored 2, and \"Cadman\" scored 3.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game.

As a result, some of the scoring lists are inaccurate.

{"title_page": "Early history of video games", "text_new": "{{short description|Games from the 1940s to the 1970s}}\n{{Good Article}}\n{{VG history|expandmenu=1}}\n\nThe [[history of video games]] spans a period of time between the invention of the first [[electronic game]]s and today, covering many inventions and developments. [[Video game|Video gaming]] reached mainstream popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when [[arcade game|arcade video games]], [[Video game console|gaming console]]s and [[PC game|home computer games]] were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of [[popular culture|modern culture]] in most parts of the world. The '''early history of video games''', therefore, covers the period of time between the first [[Interactivity|interactive]] electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s  (''[[Pong]]'' and the beginning of the [[first generation of video game consoles]] with the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], both in 1972). During this time there was a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \"video game\" used.\n\nFollowing the 1947 invention of the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]]\u2014the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display\u2014the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'' and [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, [[human\u2013computer interaction]], and computer algorithms. These include ''[[OXO]]'' and [[Christopher Strachey]]'s [[draughts]] program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', featuring moving graphics on an [[oscilloscope]]. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of ''[[Spacewar!]]'' as one of the earliest known digital [[PC game|computer games]] to be available outside a single research institute.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1960s increasing numbers of programmers wrote digital computer games, which were sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial [[video game industry]] in 1971 with the display of the coin-operated arcade game ''[[Galaxy Game]]'' and the release of the first arcade video game ''[[Computer Space]]'', and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game ''Pong'' and the first home [[video game console]], the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video-game consoles.\n\n==Defining the video game==\n[[File:Cathode ray tube amusement device - schematic.jpg|thumb|Circuitry schematic from the patent for the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]]]]\nThe term \"video game\" has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game under early definitions, there must be a video signal transmitted to a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen.<ref name=\"TVGEch1\">''The Video Game Explosion'', pp. 3\u20138</ref> This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or [[teleprinter|teletype]] rather than a display, any game rendered on a [[vector graphics|vector-scan]] monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems.<ref name=\"TVGEch1\"/> From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called \"electronic games\" or \"computer games\".<ref>''Encyclopedia of Video Games'', p. XV</ref>\n\nToday the term \"video game\" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term \"video game\" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Video Games'', p. 3\u20137</ref> Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nThe ancestors to these games include the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]], the earliest known [[Interactivity|interactive]] [[electronic game]] as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen.<ref>''The Video Game Debate'', p. 3</ref> The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an [[oscilloscope]], with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program.<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\"/> It was patented by [[Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann in 1947.<ref name=\"CRTAD_CRT game patent\"/> While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer [[DuMont Laboratories]], the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes.<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\"/><ref>''Before the Crash'', pp. 1\u20132</ref><ref name=\"Replay50s\">''Replay'', pp. 1\u20139</ref> This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by [[Alan Turing]] and [[D. G. Champernowne|David Champernowne]] in 1948, a chess simulation called [[Turochamp]], though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n==Initial games==\n[[File:Nimrod schematic.svg|thumb|A drawing of the [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computer]]\nThe earliest known publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950. ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'' was an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]].<ref name=\"CNE\"/> To showcase his new miniature [[vacuum tube]], the [[additron tube]], he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built with the assistance of engineers from [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers Majestic]]. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950.<ref name=\"Spacing\"/><ref name=\"CNEdates\"/> The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, ''Bertie'' was dismantled, and \"largely forgotten\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.<ref name=\"Spacing\"/>\n\nNearly a year later on May 5, 1951, the [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computer\u2014created by engineering firm and nascent computer developer [[Ferranti]]\u2014was presented at the [[Festival of Britain]], and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of [[Nim]]; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or \"reverse\" form of the game.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, \"Nimatron\", designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1940 for display at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]].<ref name=\"Priest\"/> \"Nimatron\" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton.<ref name=\"Nim\"/> The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n[[File:Strachey draughts ferranti.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Christopher Strachey]]'s 1952 [[draughts]] program on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]]]]\nAround this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, [[Christopher Strachey]] developed a simulation of the game [[draughts]], or checkers, for the [[Pilot ACE]] that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like ''Bertie''.<ref name=\"Priest\"/><ref name=\"TVGEahl\">''The Video Game Explosion'', pp. 31\u201334</ref> Strachey's program inspired [[Arthur Samuel]] to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the [[IBM 701]]; successive iterations developed rudimentary [[artificial intelligence]] by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956.<ref name=\"Priest\"/><ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"IBM\"/> Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the [[University of Manchester]]'s general-purpose [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, one of the first commercially available computers. The program was only capable of computing [[Chess problem#Types of problem|\"mate-in-two\" problems]] as it was not powerful enough to play a full game, and it had no video output.<ref name=\"FerChess2\"/> Around the same time in the early 1950s, military research organizations like the [[RAND Corporation]] developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity, such as [[Carmonette]], where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft, or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion.<ref name=\"TVGEahl\"/> These simulations were not yet true video games, as they required human intervention to interpret the player's orders and the final results; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take, and the program was focused on simulating events and probabilities.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Interactive visual games==\n[[File:EDSAC (19).jpg|thumb|The [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] in 1948, which ran ''[[OXO]]'']]\nIn 1952, [[Sandy Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] created ''[[OXO]]'', a software program for the [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of the first [[stored-program computers]], with memory that could be [[random-access memory|read from or written to]], and filled an entire room; it included three 35\u00d716 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"OXO\"/> As a part of a thesis on [[human\u2013computer interaction]], Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.<ref name=\"HCIAS\"/> The player entered input using a [[rotary dial|rotary telephone]] controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow.<ref>''The Computing Universe'', p. 174</ref> The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved.<ref name=\"OXOabout\"/> Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the [[Manchester Mark 1]], culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display.<ref name=\"Draughts52\"/> Like ''OXO'', the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made.<ref name=\"52Checkers\"/> ''OXO'' and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display [[video game graphics|visuals]] on an electronic screen.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nThe first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the [[University of Michigan]]-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion.<ref name=\"MIDSAC\"/> Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\n[[File:Tennis For Two in 1959.jpg|thumb|left|The set-up for ''Tennis for Two'' as exhibited in 1959]]\nWhile further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool, the program simulated a game of [[tennis]]. Created by American physicist [[William Higinbotham]] for visitors at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power, the game ran on a Donner Model 30 [[analog computer]] and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"begin@brookhaven\"/><ref name=\"1stcomputergame\"/> The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers, and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball, including the possibility of hitting the net.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The game was first shown on October 18, 1958. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity.<ref name=\"pioneer\"/> Afterwards, having served its purpose, the game was dismantled for its component parts.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development, its status as an entertainment-focused game, rather than an academic project or technological showpiece, has led it to be considered one of the first \"real\" video games as they are generally thought of today.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nOver the next few years, during 1957\u201361, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the [[TX-0]] experimental computer.<ref name=\"Mouse\"/> These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) led by [[Alan Kotok]], [[Peter Samson]], and Bob Saunders. The games included ''Tic-Tac-Toe'', which used a [[light pen]] to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and ''Mouse in the Maze''.<ref name=\"cc\"/><ref name=\"TCMR-V08\"/> ''Mouse in the Maze'' allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects.<ref name=\"Mouse\"/><ref name=\"ComputerChronicles1983\">{{Cite episode |title= Mainframes to Minis to Micros |episode-link= |url= https://archive.org/details/MainFram1984 |access-date= |series= The Computer Chronicles |series-link= |first= |last= |network= |station= |date= September 1983 |season= 1 |series-no= |number= 1 |minutes= |time= 4:52 |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as ''The Management Game'', which was used in business schools such as at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] by 1958.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities.<ref>''Business simulation in industrial and university education''</ref> As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial [[video game industry]]; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n==The spread of games==\n{{see also|Early mainframe games}}\n[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|''[[Spacewar!]]'' running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]\nBy 1961, MIT had acquired the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]] minicomputer, the successor to the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use. In 1961\u201362, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen created the game ''[[Spacewar!]]'' on the PDP-1, inspired by [[science fiction]] books such as the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]].<ref>''Introduction to Game Development''</ref><ref name=\"Space\"/> The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.<ref>''Understanding Digital Games'', p. 22</ref>\n\nThe two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield.<ref name=cc/><ref name=\"Space\"/> The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.<ref>''High Score'', p. 12</ref> The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early [[gamepad]].<ref name=\"Replay60s\">''Replay'', pp. 10\u201313</ref> ''Spacewar'' was reportedly used as a [[smoke testing (software)|smoke test]] by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.<ref>''Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution''</ref> Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 ({{Inflation|US|120000|1961|fmt=eq|r=-5}}) and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited ''Spacewar'' or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.<ref name=\"Space\"/><ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.<ref name=\"A Long Time Ago\"/>\n\n[[File:Space Travel Screenshot.png|thumb|left|180px|The development of ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'' in 1969 in part led to the development of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]]]]\nAlthough the market for commercial games\u2014and software in general\u2014was small, due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations, several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers. A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog. These included board games, \"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\", and \"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\".<ref name=\"Catalog\"/> Following the spread of ''Spacewar'', further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years. These included the Socratic System, a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace Feurzeig in 1962,<ref name=\"Socratic\"/> and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965.<ref name=\"Dice\"/> Mainframe games were developed outside of the IBM and DEC communities as well, such as the 1962 Polish ''[[Marienbad (video game)|Marienbad]]'' for the [[Odra (computer)|Odra 1003]].<ref name=\"Marienbad\"/>\n\nThe creation of general programming languages like [[BASIC]], which could be run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by [[John G. Kemeny|John Kemeny]] in 1965;<ref name=\"Baseball\"/> a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966;<ref name=\"Bingo\"/> a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967;<ref name=\"Basketball\"/> another baseball game that simulates the [[1967 World Series]] written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967;<ref name=\"Baseball2\"/> ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'', written by [[Ken Thompson]] for a [[Multics]] system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]];<ref name=\"byte198308\"/> and ''[[Hamurabi (video game)|Hamurabi]]'', a text-based [[FOCAL (programming language)|FOCAL]] game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by [[David H. Ahl]] in 1969, and one of the first [[strategy video game]]s ever made. ''Hamurabi'' and ''Space Travel'' were among several [[early mainframe games]] that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial [[mainframe computer]]s to general-purpose languages like BASIC.<ref>''BASIC Computer Games'', p. 78</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==A new industry==\n{{see also|History of video games#A new industry|Arcade game|First generation of video game consoles}}\n[[File:Galaxy Game 1971 first arcade game.jpg|thumb|''[[Galaxy Game]]'' was one of the first [[arcade game|arcade video games]].]]\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, ''[[Galaxy Game]]'', at [[Stanford University]] using a DEC [[PDP-11]] computer with vector displays.<ref name=\"stanford\"/> The pair was inspired to make the game by ''Spacewar''; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-4}}); while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.<ref name=\"Replay70s\">''Replay'', pp. 14\u201326</ref> Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with [[Nolan Bushnell]], who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.<ref name=\"stanford\"/><ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n\nThat game was ''[[Computer Space]]'', developed by Bushnell and [[Ted Dabney]]. They had found the [[Data General Nova]], a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of ''Spacewar'' at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref>''High Score'', p. 16</ref> By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy.<ref name=\"Atari4044\">''Atari, Inc.'', pp. 40\u201344</ref> Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that ''Galaxy Game'' was not a real competitor to ''Computer Space'', due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that ''Galaxy Game'' was a true expansion of ''Spacewar'', while ''Computer Space'' just a pale imitation.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> Some players at the time, however, believed ''Galaxy Game'' to actually be just a version of ''Spacewar!''.<ref>''High Score'', p. 13</ref> ''Galaxy Game''{{'}}s prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n\n[[File:Signed Pong Cabinet.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''[[Pong]]'' helped usher in a new chapter of video game history.]]\nAround the same time as ''Galaxy Game''{{'}}s prototype installation, ''Computer Space'' was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely available video game of any kind).<ref name=\"TUH\">''The Ultimate History of Video Games'', pp. 38\u201339</ref> While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where [[pinball]] and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Atari4044\"/> Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as ''Computer Space'', as well as founding their own company [[Atari, Inc.]] to back their projects.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, [[Allan Alcorn]], took a prototype [[table tennis|ping-pong]] game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> ''[[Pong]]'' was released in 1972, a year after ''Computer Space''. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"TUH\"/>\n\nThat same year saw the release of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home [[video game console]] which could be connected to a television set.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> The inventor, [[Ralph H. Baer]], had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brown Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to [[Magnavox]] to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.<ref name=\"Videogames Turn 40\"/> It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which ''Pong'' had been based on.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of ''Pong''.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Odysseysales\"/> ''Pong'' and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\">{{cite web |title=Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device |url=http://classicgames.about.com/od/classicvideogames101/p/CathodeDevice.htm |work=[[About.com]] |publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]] |accessdate=2012-05-29 |last=Cohen |first=D.

[[Video game|Video gaming]] reached mainstream popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when [[arcade game|arcade video games]], [[Video game console|gaming console]]s and [[PC game|home computer games]] were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of [[popular culture|modern culture]] in most parts of the world. The '''early history of video games''', therefore, covers the period of time between the first [[Interactivity|interactive]] electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s  (''[[Pong]]'' and the beginning of the [[first generation of video game consoles]] with the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], both in 1972). During this time there was a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \"video game\" used.\n\nFollowing the 1947 invention of the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]]\u2014the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display\u2014the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'' and [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, [[human\u2013computer interaction]], and computer algorithms. These include ''[[OXO]]'' and [[Christopher Strachey]]'s [[draughts]] program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', featuring moving graphics on an [[oscilloscope]]. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of ''[[Spacewar!]]'' as one of the earliest known digital [[PC game| computer games]] to be available outside a single research institute.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1960s increasing numbers of programmers wrote digital computer games, which were sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial [[video game industry]] in 1971 with the display of the coin-operated arcade game ''[[Galaxy Game]]'' and the release of the first arcade video game ''[[Computer Space]]'', and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game ''Pong'' and the first home [[video game console]], the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video-game consoles.\n\n==Defining the video game==\n[[File:Cathode ray tube amusement device - schematic.jpg|thumb|Circuitry schematic from the patent for the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]]]]\nThe term \"video game\" has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game under early definitions, there must be a video signal transmitted to a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen.<ref name=\"TVGEch1\">''The Video Game Explosion'', pp. 3\u20138</ref> This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or [[teleprinter|teletype]] rather than a display, any game rendered on a [[vector graphics|vector-scan]] monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems.<ref name=\"TVGEch1\"/> From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called \"electronic games\" or \"computer games\".<ref>''Encyclopedia of Video Games'', p. XV</ref>\n\nToday the term \"video game\" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term \"video game\" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Video Games'', p. 3\u20137</ref> Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nThe ancestors to these games include the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]], the earliest known [[Interactivity|interactive]] [[electronic game]] as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen.<ref>''The Video Game Debate'', p. 3</ref> The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an [[oscilloscope]], with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program.<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\"/> It was patented by [[Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann in 1947.<ref name=\"CRTAD_CRT game patent\"/> While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer [[DuMont Laboratories]], the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes.<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\"/><ref>''Before the Crash'', pp. 1\u20132</ref><ref name=\"Replay50s\">''Replay'', pp. 1\u20139</ref> This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by [[Alan Turing]] and [[D. G. Champernowne|David Champernowne]] in 1948, a chess simulation called [[Turochamp]], though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n==Initial games==\n[[File:Nimrod schematic.svg|thumb|A drawing of the [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computer]]\nThe earliest known publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950. ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'' was an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]].<ref name=\"CNE\"/> To showcase his new miniature [[vacuum tube]], the [[additron tube]], he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built with the assistance of engineers from [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers Majestic]]. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950.<ref name=\"Spacing\"/><ref name=\"CNEdates\"/> The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, ''Bertie'' was dismantled, and \"largely forgotten\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.<ref name=\"Spacing\"/>\n\nNearly a year later on May 5, 1951, the [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computer\u2014created by engineering firm and nascent computer developer [[Ferranti]]\u2014was presented at the [[Festival of Britain]], and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of [[Nim]]; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or \"reverse\" form of the game.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, \"Nimatron\", designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1940 for display at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]].<ref name=\"Priest\"/> \"Nimatron\" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton.<ref name=\"Nim\"/> The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n[[File:Strachey draughts ferranti.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Christopher Strachey]]'s 1952 [[draughts]] program on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]]]]\nAround this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, [[Christopher Strachey]] developed a simulation of the game [[draughts]], or checkers, for the [[Pilot ACE]] that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like ''Bertie''.<ref name=\"Priest\"/><ref name=\"TVGEahl\">''The Video Game Explosion'', pp. 31\u201334</ref> Strachey's program inspired [[Arthur Samuel]] to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the [[IBM 701]]; successive iterations developed rudimentary [[artificial intelligence]] by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956.<ref name=\"Priest\"/><ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"IBM\"/> Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the [[University of Manchester]]'s general-purpose [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, one of the first commercially available computers. The program was only capable of computing [[Chess problem#Types of problem|\"mate-in-two\" problems]] as it was not powerful enough to play a full game, and it had no video output.<ref name=\"FerChess2\"/> Around the same time in the early 1950s, military research organizations like the [[RAND Corporation]] developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity, such as [[Carmonette]], where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft, or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion.<ref name=\"TVGEahl\"/> These simulations were not yet true video games, as they required human intervention to interpret the player's orders and the final results; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take, and the program was focused on simulating events and probabilities.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Interactive visual games==\n[[File:EDSAC (19).jpg|thumb|The [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] in 1948, which ran ''[[OXO]]'']]\nIn 1952, [[Sandy Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] created ''[[OXO]]'', a software program for the [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of the first [[stored-program computers]], with memory that could be [[random-access memory|read from or written to]], and filled an entire room; it included three 35\u00d716 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"OXO\"/> As a part of a thesis on [[human\u2013computer interaction]], Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.<ref name=\"HCIAS\"/> The player entered input using a [[rotary dial|rotary telephone]] controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow.<ref>''The Computing Universe'', p. 174</ref> The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved.<ref name=\"OXOabout\"/> Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the [[Manchester Mark 1]], culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display.<ref name=\"Draughts52\"/> Like ''OXO'', the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made.<ref name=\"52Checkers\"/> ''OXO'' and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display [[video game graphics|visuals]] on an electronic screen.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nThe first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the [[University of Michigan]]-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion.<ref name=\"MIDSAC\"/> Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\n[[File:Tennis For Two in 1959.jpg|thumb|left|The set-up for ''Tennis for Two'' as exhibited in 1959]]\nWhile further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool, the program simulated a game of [[tennis]]. Created by American physicist [[William Higinbotham]] for visitors at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power, the game ran on a Donner Model 30 [[analog computer]] and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/><ref name=\"begin@brookhaven\"/><ref name=\"1stcomputergame\"/> The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers, and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball, including the possibility of hitting the net.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The game was first shown on October 18, 1958. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity.<ref name=\"pioneer\"/> Afterwards, having served its purpose, the game was dismantled for its component parts.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development, its status as an entertainment-focused game, rather than an academic project or technological showpiece, has led it to be considered one of the first \"real\" video games as they are generally thought of today.<ref name=\"Priest\"/>\n\nOver the next few years, during 1957\u201361, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the [[TX-0]] experimental computer.<ref name=\"Mouse\"/> These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) led by [[Alan Kotok]], [[Peter Samson]], and Bob Saunders. The games included ''Tic-Tac-Toe'', which used a [[light pen]] to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and ''Mouse in the Maze''.<ref name=\"cc\"/><ref name=\"TCMR-V08\"/> ''Mouse in the Maze'' allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects.<ref name=\"Mouse\"/><ref name=\"ComputerChronicles1983\">{{Cite episode |title= Mainframes to Minis to Micros |episode-link= |url= https://archive.org/details/MainFram1984 |access-date= |series= The Computer Chronicles |series-link= |first= |last= |network= |station= |date= September 1983 |season= 1 |series-no= |number= 1 |minutes= |time= 4:52 |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as ''The Management Game'', which was used in business schools such as at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] by 1958.<ref name=\"Priest\"/> By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities.<ref>''Business simulation in industrial and university education''</ref> As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial [[video game industry]]; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.<ref name=\"Replay50s\"/>\n\n==The spread of games==\n{{see also|Early mainframe games}}\n[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|''[[Spacewar!]]'' running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]\nBy 1961, MIT had acquired the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]] minicomputer, the successor to the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen created the game ''[[Spacewar!]]'' on the PDP-1, inspired by [[science fiction]] books such as the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]].<ref>''Introduction to Game Development''</ref><ref name=\"Space\"/> The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.<ref>''Understanding Digital Games'', p. 22</ref>\n\nThe two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield.<ref name=cc/><ref name=\"Space\"/> The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.<ref>''High Score'', p. 12</ref> The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early [[gamepad]].<ref name=\"Replay60s\">''Replay'', pp. 10\u201313</ref> ''Spacewar'' was reportedly used as a [[smoke testing (software)|smoke test]] by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.<ref>''Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution''</ref> Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 ({{Inflation|US|120000|1961|fmt=eq|r=-5}}) and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited ''Spacewar'' or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.<ref name=\"Space\"/><ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.<ref name=\"A Long Time Ago\"/>\n\n[[File:Space Travel Screenshot.png|thumb|left|180px|The development of ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'' in 1969 in part led to the development of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]]]]\nAlthough the market for commercial games\u2014and software in general\u2014was small, due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations, several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers. A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog. These included board games, \"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\", and \"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\".<ref name=\"Catalog\"/> Following the spread of ''Spacewar'', further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years. These included the Socratic System, a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace Feurzeig in 1962,<ref name=\"Socratic\"/> and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965.<ref name=\"Dice\"/> Mainframe games were developed outside of the IBM and DEC communities as well, such as the 1962 Polish ''[[Marienbad (video game)|Marienbad]]'' for the [[Odra (computer)|Odra 1003]].<ref name=\"Marienbad\"/>\n\nThe creation of general programming languages like [[BASIC]], which could be run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by [[John G. Kemeny|John Kemeny]] in 1965;<ref name=\"Baseball\"/> a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966;<ref name=\"Bingo\"/> a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967;<ref name=\"Basketball\"/> another baseball game that simulates the [[1967 World Series]] written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967;<ref name=\"Baseball2\"/> ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'', written by [[Ken Thompson]] for a [[Multics]] system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]];<ref name=\"byte198308\"/> and ''[[Hamurabi (video game)|Hamurabi]]'', a text-based [[FOCAL (programming language)|FOCAL]] game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by [[David H. Ahl]] in 1969, and one of the first [[strategy video game]]s ever made. ''Hamurabi'' and ''Space Travel'' were among several [[early mainframe games]] that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial [[mainframe computer]]s to general-purpose languages like BASIC.<ref>''BASIC Computer Games'', p. 78</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==A new industry==\n{{see also|History of video games#A new industry|Arcade game|First generation of video game consoles}}\n[[File:Galaxy Game 1971 first arcade game.jpg|thumb|''[[Galaxy Game]]'' was one of the first [[arcade game|arcade video games]].]]\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, ''[[Galaxy Game]]'', at [[Stanford University]] using a DEC [[PDP-11]] computer with vector displays.<ref name=\"stanford\"/> The pair was inspired to make the game by ''Spacewar''; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-4}}); while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.<ref name=\"Replay70s\">''Replay'', pp. 14\u201326</ref> Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with [[Nolan Bushnell]], who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.<ref name=\"stanford\"/><ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n\nThat game was ''[[Computer Space]]'', developed by Bushnell and [[Ted Dabney]]. They had found the [[Data General Nova]], a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of ''Spacewar'' at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref>''High Score'', p. 16</ref> By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy.<ref name=\"Atari4044\">''Atari, Inc.'', pp. 40\u201344</ref> Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that ''Galaxy Game'' was not a real competitor to ''Computer Space'', due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that ''Galaxy Game'' was a true expansion of ''Spacewar'', while ''Computer Space'' just a pale imitation.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> Some players at the time, however, believed ''Galaxy Game'' to actually be just a version of ''Spacewar!''.<ref>''High Score'', p. 13</ref> ''Galaxy Game''{{'}}s prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n\n[[File:Signed Pong Cabinet.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''[[Pong]]'' helped usher in a new chapter of video game history.]]\nAround the same time as ''Galaxy Game''{{'}}s prototype installation, ''Computer Space'' was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely available video game of any kind).<ref name=\"TUH\">''The Ultimate History of Video Games'', pp. 38\u201339</ref> While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where [[pinball]] and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Atari4044\"/> Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as ''Computer Space'', as well as founding their own company [[Atari, Inc.]] to back their projects.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, [[Allan Alcorn]], took a prototype [[table tennis|ping-pong]] game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> ''[[Pong]]'' was released in 1972, a year after ''Computer Space''. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"TUH\"/>\n\nThat same year saw the release of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home [[video game console]] which could be connected to a television set.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> The inventor, [[Ralph H. Baer]], had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brown Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to [[Magnavox]] to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.<ref name=\"Videogames Turn 40\"/> It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which ''Pong'' had been based on.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of ''Pong''.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Odysseysales\"/> ''Pong'' and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"CRTAD_about.com\">{{cite web |title=Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device |url=http://classicgames.about.com/od/classicvideogames101/p/CathodeDevice.htm |work=[[About.com]] |publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]] |accessdate=2012-05-29 |last=Cohen |first=D.

Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. \n\nThe Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]]. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the [[Abava Valley]], which is often locally referred to as \"Switzerland of Courland\" in as early as the 19th century. Since January 2011, the valley has been on Latvia's Tentative World Heritage List, according to World Monuments Fund. <ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite

The railroad became a line in the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] and then the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\nIn 1990, there were 11,971 residents reported for Appomattox County; the Town of Appomattox had 1703 residents.\n\nIn addition to Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, the [[Appomattox River Bridge]], [[Appomattox Historic District]], [[Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center]], and [[Holliday Lake State Park]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2010 Appomattox shootings]] occurred from January 17 to 20 and left eight people dead.\n\n==Geography==\nAppomattox is located at {{coord|37|21|32|N|78|49|35|W|type:city}} (37.358973, &minus;78.826438).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 2.2&nbsp;square miles (5.6&nbsp;km\u00b2).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 704\n|1940= 992\n|1950= 1094\n|1960= 1184\n|1970= 1400\n|1980= 1345\n|1990= 1707\n|2000= 1761\n|2010= 1733\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1792\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df=mdy }}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 1,761 people, 716 households, and 469 families residing in the town.

Rust was first released in early access in December 2013 and received its full release in February 2018. ''Rust'' is available on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]. Console versions for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] have been announced for release in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965525/rust-ps4-xbox-one-release-dates-2020|title=Rust comes to PS4 and Xbox One next year|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=14 November 2019|work=Polygon|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref> ''Rust'' was initially created as a [[Video game clone|clone]] of ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'', a popular [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[ARMA 2]]'', with [[Glossary of video game terms#Crafting|crafting]] elements akin to those in ''[[Minecraft]]''.\n\nThe objective of ''Rust'' is to survive in the wilderness using gathered or stolen materials. Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the looming threat of [[American black bears|bears]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the primary menace is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through [[firearm]]s and primitive weapons, such as [[Bow and arrow|bow]]s. In addition, vehicles controlled by [[non-player character]]s will occasionally roam, attacking heavily-armed players. These can be defeated with persistence. ''Rust'' features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's [[open world]]. To stay protected, players must build [[Military base|base]]s or join [[Clan (computer gaming)|clan]]s to improve their chance of survival. [[Raid (gaming)|Raiding]] is a major aspect of ''Rust'' and is done more frequently by large clans.\n\n''Rust'' was first released in December 2013 to the [[Steam Early Access]] program; this early access state is now known as Rust Legacy. Further into its development, the gameplay was changed significantly. Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released. 2014 saw the game ported to the [[Unity 5]] [[game engine]], providing substantial graphical changes. Around this time, ''Rust'' introduced immutable, predetermined [[Race (human categorization)|skin colour]] and [[biological sex]] tied to players' [[Steam (website)|Steam]] account details. Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates.\n\nThroughout ''Rust''{{'}}s alpha release, critical reviews were mixed, with many comparisons made to other survival games. ''Rust'' was commonly explained as being a mixture of ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]''. During this period, reviewers frequently noted the game's unfinished nature. During its pre-release phase, critics praised the concept and gameplay and by March 2017, ''Rust'' had sold over five million copies. After leaving Early Access, it received mixed reviews from critics. The [[player vs player]] combat and survival aspects were highlighted by those who enjoyed the game, though reviewers were critical of the constant need to [[Grinding (gaming)|grind]] for materials, along with the harsh beginner experience.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Collecting wood in Rust.jpeg|right|thumb|280px|A player using the starting rock to gather wood]]\nAs a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only video game,<ref name=\"5MC\">{{cite web|title = 5 Video Games to Play if You Like \u2018Minecraft\u2019|url = http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|accessdate = 1 July 2015|website = CheatSheet|first = Chris|date = 30 June 2015|last = Reed|page = 4|url-status = live|archivedate = 21 September 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160921085950/http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|df = dmy-all}}</ref> ''Rust'' puts players against each other in a harsh, [[open world]] environment with the sole goal of survival.

Critics praised the PvP combat, difficulty, and survival aspects, while grinding and the experience had by new players came under some criticism.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/><ref

For instance, Luke Winkie of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' summarised the game saying, \"Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or [[mythos]], or win condition.\"<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> He described the beginner experience as \"quite prickly\" but continued on to praise the combat, joking that \"connecting [a] hatchet with an idiot's head feels great\". Gloria Manderfeld, a writer for the German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'', echoed these opinions, adding there was little end-game besides PvP. However, she opined the PvP itself was effective.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> Ray Porreca of ''[[Destructoid]]'' described the combat as the \"meat\" of the game.

He also expressed a sense of appreciation for those dedicated to the game, mentioning the YouTube videos of large, multi-clan raids.

Critics praised the environment, but denounced the animations and character models.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Barbosa described the animations as \"stiff and unnatural\" and the models \"ugly and dull\".<ref name=\n\"GS-review\"/> Additionally, the way ''Rust'' uses sound was commended by Gwaltney, who explained it as being compelling due to the way players must listen for others in order to survive.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{portal|Video games}}\n* {{Official website|rust.facepunch.com}}\n\n[[Category:2018 video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:Steam Workshop games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games that support Vulkan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2016}}\n{{short description|Survival video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Rust\n| image = File:Rust vector logo.svg\n| developer = [[Facepunch Studios]]\n| publisher = Facepunch Studios\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released = 8 February 2018\n| genre = [[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]], [[Survival game|survival]]\n| modes = [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\n| director = \n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = \n| composer = \n}}\n\n'''''Rust''''' is a [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only [[Survival game|survival]] [[video game]] developed by [[Facepunch Studios|Facepunch Studios.]] Rust was first released in early access in December 2013 and received its full release in February 2018. ''Rust'' is available on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]. Console versions for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] have been announced for release in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965525/rust-ps4-xbox-one-release-dates-2020|title=Rust comes to PS4 and Xbox One next year|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=14 November 2019|work=Polygon|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref> ''Rust'' was initially created as a [[Video game clone|clone]] of ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'', a popular [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[ARMA 2]]'', with [[Glossary of video game terms#Crafting|crafting]] elements akin to those in ''[[Minecraft]]''. \n\nThe objective of ''Rust'' is to survive in the wilderness using gathered or stolen materials. Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the looming threat of [[American black bears|bears]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the primary menace is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through [[firearm]]s and primitive weapons, such as [[Bow and arrow|bow]]s. In addition, vehicles controlled by [[non-player character]]s will occasionally roam, attacking heavily-armed players. These can be defeated with persistence. ''Rust'' features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's [[open world]]. To stay protected, players must build [[Military base|base]]s or join [[Clan (computer gaming)|clan]]s to improve their chance of survival. [[Raid (gaming)|Raiding]] is a major aspect of ''Rust'' and is done more frequently by large clans. \n\n''Rust'' was first released in December 2013 to the [[Steam Early Access]] program; this early access state is now known as Rust Legacy. Further into its development, the gameplay was changed significantly. Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released. 2014 saw the game ported to the [[Unity 5]] [[game engine]], providing substantial graphical changes. Around this time, ''Rust'' introduced immutable, predetermined [[Race (human categorization)|skin colour]] and [[biological sex]] tied to players' [[Steam (website)|Steam]] account details. Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates.\n\nThroughout ''Rust''{{'}}s alpha release, critical reviews were mixed, with many comparisons made to other survival games. ''Rust'' was commonly explained as being a mixture of ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]''. During this period, reviewers frequently noted the game's unfinished nature. During its pre-release phase, critics praised the concept and gameplay and by March 2017, ''Rust'' had sold over five million copies. After leaving Early Access, it received mixed reviews from critics. The [[player vs player]] combat and survival aspects were highlighted by those who enjoyed the game, though reviewers were critical of the constant need to [[Grinding (gaming)|grind]] for materials, along with the harsh beginner experience.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Collecting wood in Rust.jpeg|right|thumb|280px|A player using the starting rock to gather wood]]\nAs a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only video game,<ref name=\"5MC\">{{cite web|title = 5 Video Games to Play if You Like \u2018Minecraft\u2019|url = http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|accessdate = 1 July 2015|website = CheatSheet|first = Chris|date = 30 June 2015|last = Reed|page = 4|url-status = live|archivedate = 21 September 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160921085950/http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|df = dmy-all}}</ref> ''Rust'' puts players against each other in a harsh, [[open world]] environment with the sole goal of survival.

Critics praised the PvP combat, difficulty, and survival aspects, while grinding and the experience had by new players came under some criticism.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/><ref name=\"RPS-review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/12/rust-review|title=Wot I Think: Rust|first=Matt|last=Cox|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=13 February

Shotgun]]}}</ref><ref name=\"PCG-review\"/>\n\nMany critics held the opinion that while starting anew was frustrating, the combat was rewarding. For instance, Luke Winkie of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' summarised the game saying, \"Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or [[mythos]], or win condition.\"<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> He described the beginner experience as \"quite prickly\" but continued on to praise the combat, joking that \"connecting [a] hatchet with an idiot's head feels great\". Gloria Manderfeld, a writer for the German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'', echoed these opinions, adding there was little end-game besides PvP. However, she opined the PvP itself was effective.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> Ray Porreca of ''[[Destructoid]]'' described the combat as the \"meat\" of the game. However, he wrote that the experience would vary depending on their desire to fight. \"If you can look past a community that tends to be [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#toxicity|toxic]], ''Rust''{{'}}s sprawling plains and toppled landmarks are an excellent backdrop for player-driven storytelling and pitched, dramatic moments.\"<ref name=\"Destructoid-review\"/> In a negative review ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Alessandro Barbosa said the whole experience felt unfulfilling. He described the game as lacking certain creative features, like the ability to easily redesign bases.<ref name=\"GS-review\"/>\n\nThe disdain towards the experience as a new player was noted in conjunction with the necessity of grinding, and how repetitive that became. ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s review described the game as expecting the player to spend all their gaming time on it, fearing that failing to do so will result in being raided and needing to begin again.<ref name=\"IGN-review\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Javy Gwaltney reiterated this, explaining it felt demotivating when they died solely because they came in contact with someone more experienced.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Agreeing with Manderfeld's description,<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> in an updated review Cox said his patience wore thin after a while. He said that while maintaining [[health (gaming)|health bars]] may have once been enjoyable, he balked at the prospect in 2018.<ref name=\"RPS-review\"/>\n\nNonetheless, some critics praised the game's difficulty, mentioning the satisfaction they felt after managing to survive successfully. Porreca recommended the game to those willing to dedicate time, saying the game offers \"a social sandbox and a deep, functioning crafting system\".<ref name=\"Destructoid-review\"/> Winkie expressed interest in the necessity of managing hunger, thirst, and health while learning more and discovering better items. He also expressed a sense of appreciation for those dedicated to the game, mentioning the YouTube videos of large, multi-clan raids. He closed the review saying everyone should try ''Rust'' due to its difference from other games.<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> Cox agreed noting the game's brutality only added to the gratification a player felt when they managed to eventually succeed.<ref name=\"RPS-review\"/>\n\nThe reception towards the graphics were mixed. Critics praised the environment, but denounced the animations and character models.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Barbosa described the animations as \"stiff and unnatural\" and the models \"ugly and dull\".<ref name=\n\"GS-review\"/> Additionally, the way ''Rust'' uses sound was commended by Gwaltney, who explained it as being compelling due to the way players must listen for others in order to survive.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{portal|Video games}}\n* {{Official website|rust.facepunch.com}}\n\n[[Category:2018 video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:Steam Workshop games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games that support Vulkan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: Playstation \u2192 PlayStation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(video_game)"}
