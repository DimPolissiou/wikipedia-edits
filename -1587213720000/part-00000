Before the Motera Stadium came into existence, international cricket matches in the city were played at [[Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]]'s [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad|stadium of the same name]] (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a {{convert|100|acre|m2|adj=on}} stretch of land on the banks of the [[Sabarmati River]] for the construction of a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was carried out in a span of nine months.<ref name='htold'>{{cite news|title=Why Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad will make cricket history|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/why-sardar-patel-stadium-in-motera-ahmedabad-will-make-cricket-history/story-7b59h4SZG5yHl7BGkg9agK.html|accessdate=10 Dec 2016|newspaper=HindustanTimes|date=10 December 2016|author=HT Correspondent}}</ref> Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted here. Later in the 1984-85 Australia-India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first [[One Day International|ODI]], in which [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] defeated [[Indian cricket team|India]].\n\n[[Sunil Gavaskar]] became the first cricketer to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket on this ground \u2013 a feat he achieved against Pakistan in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title=India Today article on Sunil Gavaskar's 10,000 runs|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1987-Gavaskar+is+the+first+to+score+10,000+test+runs:+A+10+tonne+toast/1/76385.html}}</ref> Seven years later, [[Kapil Dev]] claimed his 432nd Test wicket on this ground to become the highest wicket-taker in the world, breaking [[Richard Hadlee|Sir Richard Hadlee's]] previous record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ashaval.com/motera-stadium-0221119/|title=Motera Stadium: Inaugration, Renovationm and Seating Capacity |last=Paliwal|first=Priyansha|date=2020-02-08|website=Ashaval.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> Prior to achieving this, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against West Indies at the Motera ground in 1983. In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], where the visitors faltered while chasing 170 to win, ending up at 105 all out. [[Javagal Srinath]] took six wickets in the fourth innings of the match. However, South Africa had their revenge when they bowled India out for 76 runs in the first session of the Test match in 2008 and went on to win the game by an innings and 90 runs.\n\n===2006-2015 (Rise to Prominence)===\nThe stadium had become of the focal venues of [[ICC Champions Trophy]] in 2006,  with hosting five of the 15 games played. In order to host such an organization, the stadium had gone into a comprehensive renovation that includes three new pitches and a new outfield. Moreover, floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.\n\nThe Motera Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the [[Cricket World Cup]], including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. However, while it hosted only one game each in the 1987 and 1996 editions, the stadium was given three games in the 2011 World Cup, including the quarter-final between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[India cricket team|India]]. Sachin Tendulkar became the first-ever cricketer to score 18,000 runs in One Day International cricket, during that match. As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted 12 Tests, 23 ODIs and 1 T20I.\n\n===2015-2020 (Reconstruction)===\n[[File:President_Trump_and_the_First_Lady_in_India_(49579268442).jpg|thumb|US President [[Donald Trump]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] at the Sardar Patel Stadium, 24 February 2020.]]\nIn October 2015, the stadium was demolished to allow for reconstruction. Though some media cite it as 'renovation', it is to be noted that the original venue was completely demolished. Hence, effectively it is an entirely new stadium in place. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]700 crores. However, the final cost has been reported at [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]800 crores. The redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, was accomplished finally by February 2020.\n\n====Conception====\nReportedly, the idea to make the new stadium was proposed by [[Narendra Modi]], then the president of the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] and the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi as the [[Prime Minister of India]], there were discussions about minor upgrades to the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. When informed about the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], Modi asked the officials to build a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.<ref name=\"Gujarat soon to have the largest stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2019/09/16/Gujarat-will-soon-have-world-largest-cricket-stadium-All-you-need-to-know.html|title=Motera stadium: All you need to know}}</ref> The stadium has often been touted as one of his dream projects.\n\n====Bids====\nAfter starting the demolition work at the end of 2015, the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] issued a tender notice on January 1, 2016 in [[The Times of India]] and [[The Indian Express]]. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three actually submitted Technical and Financial bids on time. The three bidders were the [[Shapoorji Pallonji Group]], Nagarjuna Construction Company, and [[Larsen & Toubro]]. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed for the evaluation of tenders. Additionally, STUP Consultants was appointed as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.<ref name=\"Motera Stadium - GCA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gujaratcricketassociation.com/page/motera-stadium|title=GCA \u2013 Motera Stadium}}</ref>\n\nEach of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts & designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation, etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bids Submitted for Motera Reconstruction\n!

A unique feature of the Stadium is the LED lights on the roof instead of the usual floodlights at cricket grounds. This will be the first of its kind design in India. The LED lights are installed on an anti-bacterial, fireproof canopy with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres of the total 55 metres breadth of sitting area. The roof has been designed by the company [[Walter P Moore]], been specifically designed to be lightweight and separate from the seating bowls in order to allow for movement in times of seismic activity, making it fairly earthquake resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walterpmoore.com/projects/motera-cricket-stadium-roof-design|title=Motera Stadium roof design}}</ref> The structure eliminates the need for pillars, giving spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from any place in the Stadium.\n \nOutside of the main ground, the Stadium will be able to accommodate several other features, including an olympic sized swimming pool, indoor cricket academy, badminton and tennis courts, squash arena, table tennis area, 3D projector theatre and a clubhouse with three practice grounds and 50 rooms.<ref name=\"World's largest stadium to host POTUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/kem-chho-trump-world-largest-cricket-stadium-all-set-to-host-potus/story/396505.html|title=Motera Stadium ready to host POTUS|work=Business Today}}</ref> The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. The Motera Stadium also has a huge ramp designed to facilitate the movement of around 60,000 people simultaneously.

Moreover, floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.\n\nThe Motera Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the [[Cricket World Cup]], including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. However, while it hosted only one game each in the 1987 and 1996 editions, the stadium was given three games in the 2011 World Cup, including the quarter-final between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[India cricket team|India]]. Sachin Tendulkar became the first-ever cricketer to score 18,000 runs in One Day International cricket, during that match. As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted 12 Tests, 23 ODIs and 1 T20I.\n\n===2015-2020 (Reconstruction)===\n[[File:President_Trump_and_the_First_Lady_in_India_(49579268442).jpg|thumb|US President [[Donald Trump]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] at the Sardar Patel Stadium, 24 February 2020.]]\nIn October 2015, the stadium was demolished to allow for reconstruction. Though some media cite it as 'renovation', it is to be noted that the original venue was completely demolished. Hence, effectively it is an entirely new stadium in place. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]700 crores. However, the final cost has been reported at [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]800 crores. The redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, was accomplished finally by February 2020.\n\n====Conception====\nReportedly, the idea to make the new stadium was proposed by [[Narendra Modi]], then the president of the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] and the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi as the [[Prime Minister of India]], there were discussions about minor upgrades to the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. When informed about the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], Modi asked the officials to build a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.<ref name=\"Gujarat soon to have the largest stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2019/09/16/Gujarat-will-soon-have-world-largest-cricket-stadium-All-you-need-to-know.html|title=Motera stadium: All you need to know}}</ref> The stadium has often been touted as one of his dream projects.\n\n====Bids====\nAfter starting the demolition work at the end of 2015, the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] issued a tender notice on January 1, 2016 in [[The Times of India]] and [[The Indian Express]]. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three actually submitted Technical and Financial bids on time. The three bidders were the [[Shapoorji Pallonji Group]], Nagarjuna Construction Company, and [[Larsen & Toubro]]. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed for the evaluation of tenders. Additionally, STUP Consultants was appointed as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.<ref name=\"Motera Stadium - GCA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gujaratcricketassociation.com/page/motera-stadium|title=GCA \u2013 Motera Stadium}}</ref>\n\nEach of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts & designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation, etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bids Submitted for Motera Reconstruction\n!

A unique feature of the Stadium is the LED lights on the roof instead of the usual floodlights at cricket grounds. This will be the first of its kind design in India. The LED lights are installed on an anti-bacterial, fireproof canopy with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres of the total 55 metres breadth of sitting area. The roof has been designed by the company [[Walter P Moore]], been specifically designed to be lightweight and separate from the seating bowls in order to allow for movement in times of seismic activity, making it fairly earthquake resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walterpmoore.com/projects/motera-cricket-stadium-roof-design|title=Motera Stadium roof design}}</ref> The structure eliminates the need for pillars, giving spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from any place in the Stadium.\n \nOutside of the main ground, the Stadium will be able to accommodate several other features, including an olympic sized swimming pool, indoor cricket academy, badminton and tennis courts, squash arena, table tennis area, 3D projector theatre and a clubhouse with three practice grounds and 50 rooms.<ref name=\"World's largest stadium to host POTUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/kem-chho-trump-world-largest-cricket-stadium-all-set-to-host-potus/story/396505.html|title=Motera Stadium ready to host POTUS|work=Business Today}}</ref> The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. The Motera Stadium also has a huge ramp designed to facilitate the movement of around 60,000 people simultaneously.
