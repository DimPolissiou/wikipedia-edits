In millions of years, [[slab pull]], [[ridge-push]], and other forces of [[tectonophysics]] will further separate and rotate those two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted.\n\nThe widespread distribution of [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

Similar plant and animal [[fossil]]s are found around the shores of different continents, suggesting that they were once joined. The fossils of ''[[Mesosaurus]]'', a freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile, found both in [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]], are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land [[reptile]] ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' in [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] of the same age at locations in [[Africa]], [[India]], and [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/continents.html |publisher=USGS |title=Rejoined continents [This Dynamic Earth, USGS] |access-date=22 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825180951/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/continents.html |archive-date=25 August 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> There is also living evidence, with the same animals being found on two continents.

In millions of years, [[slab pull]], [[ridge-push]], and other forces of [[tectonophysics]] will further separate and rotate those two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted.\n\nThe widespread distribution of [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

Using [[Immunostaining|antibody staining]], they were able to show that the mouse and human proteins remained segregated to separate halves of the heterokaryon a short time after cell fusion.

While Singer and Nicolson had substantial evidence drawn from multiple subfields to support their model, recent advances in [[fluorescence microscopy]] and [[structural biology]] have validated the fluid mosaic nature of cell membranes.\n\n==Subsequent developments==\n\n===Membrane asymmetry===\nAdditionally, the two leaflets of biological membranes are asymmetric and divided into subdomains composed of specific proteins or lipids, allowing spatial segregation of biological processes associated with membranes. [[Cholesterol]] and cholesterol-interacting proteins can concentrate into lipid rafts and constrain cell signaling processes to only these rafts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silvius JR |title=Partitioning of membrane molecules between raft and non-raft domains: Insights from model-membrane studies |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1746 |issue=3 |pages=193\u2013202 |date=2005 |pmid=16271405 |url=  |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2005.09.003|doi-access=free }}</ref> Another form of asymmetry was shown by the work of Mouritsen and Bloom in 1984, where they proposed a [[Hydrophobic mismatch#Mattress model|Mattress Model]] of lipid-protein interactions to address the biophysical evidence that the membrane can range in thickness and hydrophobicity of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mouritsen OG, Bloom M |title=Mattress model of lipid-protein interactions in membranes |journal=Biophys J |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013153 |date=1984 |pmid=6478029 |url=http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(84)84007-2 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(84)84007-2 |pmc=1435039}}</ref>\n\n===Non-bilayer membranes===\nThe existence of non-bilayer lipid formations with important biological functions was confirmed subsequent to publication of the fluid mosaic model.

Local curvature of the membrane can be caused by the asymmetry and non-bilayer organization of lipids as discussed above. More dramatic and functional curvature is achieved through [[BAR domain]]s, which bind to [[phosphatidylinositol]] on the membrane surface, assisting in [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] formation, [[organelle]] formation and cell division.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frost A |title=The BAR domain superfamily: membrane-molding macromolecules |journal=Cell |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=191\u20136 |date=2009 |pmid=19379681 |pmc=4832598 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(09)00397-3 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.010|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Curvature development is in constant flux and contributes to the dynamic nature of biological membranes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda R |title=Bimodal spectrum for the curvature fluctuations of bilayer vesicles: pure bending plus hybrid curvature-dilation modes |journal=Phys Rev Lett |volume=102 |issue=12 |page=128101 |date=2009 |pmid=19392326 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.128101|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Lipid movement within the membrane===\nDuring the decade of 1970, it was acknowledged that individual lipid molecules undergo free lateral diffusion within each of the layers of the lipid membrane.<ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=5th |pages = 621\u2013622 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5 |year=2008 |url=http://www.garlandscience.com/garlandscience_resources/book_resources.jsf?isbn=9780815341055&landing=student |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Diffusion occurs at a high speed, with an average lipid molecule diffusing ~2&nbsp;\u00b5m, approximately the length of a large [[bacteria]]l cell, in about 1 second.<ref name=\"Alberts\"/> It has also been observed that individual lipid molecules rotate rapidly around their own axis.<ref name=\"Alberts\"/> Moreover, phospholipid molecules can, although they seldom do, migrate from one side of the lipid bilayer to the other (a process known as flip-flop). However, flip-flop might be enhanced by flippase enzymes. The processes described above influence the disordered nature of lipid molecules and interacting proteins in the lipid membranes, with consequences to membrane fluidity, signaling, trafficking and function.\n\n==Restrictions to bilayer fluidity==\nThere are restrictions to the lateral mobility of the lipid and protein components in the fluid membrane imposed by the formation of subdomains within the lipid bilayer. These subdomains arise by several processes ''e.g.'' binding of membrane components to the extracellular matrix, nanometric membrane regions with a particular biochemical composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts and protein complexes mediated by protein-protein interactions.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> Furthermore, protein-cytoskeleton associations mediate the formation of \u201ccytoskeletal fences\u201d, corrals wherein lipid and membrane proteins can diffuse freely, but that they can seldom leave.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> Restriction on lateral diffusion rates of membrane components is very important because it allows the functional specialization of particular regions within the cell membranes.\n\n===Lipid rafts===\n[[Lipid raft]]s are membrane nanometric platforms with a particular lipid and protein composition that laterally diffuse, navigating on the liquid bilipid layer. Sphingolipids and cholesterol are important building blocks of the lipid rafts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingwood D, Simons K |title=Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5961 |pages=46\u201350 |date=2010 |pmid=20044567 |doi=10.1126/science.1174621|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0576f71d2e566028fef991d2e799bb22448b7702 }}</ref>\n \n===Protein complexes===\nCell membrane proteins and glycoproteins do not exist as single elements of the lipid membrane, as first proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. Rather, they occur as diffusing complexes within the membrane.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> The assembly of single molecules into these macromolecular complexes has important functional consequences for the cell; such as [[Membrane transport|ion and metabolite transport]], signaling, [[cell adhesion]], and [[Cell migration|migration]].<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/>\n \n===Cytoskeletal fences (corrals) and binding to the extracellular matrix===\n\nSome proteins embedded in the bilipid layer interact with the extracellular matrix outside the cell, cytoskeleton filaments inside the cell, and septin ring-like structures. These interactions have a strong influence on shape and structure, as well as on [[Cellular compartment|compartmentalization]]. Moreover, they impose physical constraints that restrict the free lateral diffusion of proteins and at least some lipids within the bilipid layer.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/>\n \nWhen integral proteins of the lipid bilayer are tethered to the extracellular matrix, they are unable to diffuse freely. Proteins with a long intracellular domain may collide with a fence formed by cytoskeleton filaments.<ref>{{cite journal |author= G.

Lowering the temperature slowed the rate of this diffusion by causing the membrane phospholipids to transition from a fluid to a gel phase.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Frye LD, Edidin M |title=The rapid intermixing of cell surface antigens after formation of mouse-human heterokaryons |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=319\u201335 |date=1970 |pmid=4098863 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/7/2/319.abstract}}</ref> Singer and Nicolson rationalized the results of these experiments using their fluid mosaic model.<ref name=\"Singer1972\"/>\n\nThe fluid mosaic model explains changes in structure and behavior of cell membranes under different temperatures, as well as the association of membrane proteins with the membranes. While Singer and Nicolson had substantial evidence drawn from multiple subfields to support their model, recent advances in [[fluorescence microscopy]] and [[structural biology]] have validated the fluid mosaic nature of cell membranes.\n\n==Subsequent developments==\n\n===Membrane asymmetry===\nAdditionally, the two leaflets of biological membranes are asymmetric and divided into subdomains composed of specific proteins or lipids, allowing spatial segregation of biological processes associated with membranes. [[Cholesterol]] and cholesterol-interacting proteins can concentrate into lipid rafts and constrain cell signaling processes to only these rafts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silvius JR |title=Partitioning of membrane molecules between raft and non-raft domains: Insights from model-membrane studies |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1746 |issue=3 |pages=193\u2013202 |date=2005 |pmid=16271405 |url=  |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2005.09.003|doi-access=free }}</ref> Another form of asymmetry was shown by the work of Mouritsen and Bloom in 1984, where they proposed a [[Hydrophobic mismatch#Mattress model|Mattress Model]] of lipid-protein interactions to address the biophysical evidence that the membrane can range in thickness and hydrophobicity of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mouritsen OG, Bloom M |title=Mattress model of lipid-protein interactions in membranes |journal=Biophys J |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013153 |date=1984 |pmid=6478029 |url=http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(84)84007-2 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(84)84007-2 |pmc=1435039}}</ref>\n\n===Non-bilayer membranes===\nThe existence of non-bilayer lipid formations with important biological functions was confirmed subsequent to publication of the fluid mosaic model. These membrane structures may be useful when the cell needs to propagate a non bilayer form, which occurs during cell division and the formation of a [[gap junction]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van den Brink-van der Laan E |title=Nonbilayer lipids affect peripheral and integral membrane proteins via changes in the lateral pressure profile |journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |volume=1666 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=275\u201388 |date=2004 |pmid=15519321 |url=  |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.06.010|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n \n===Membrane curvature===\nThe membrane bilayer is not always flat. Local curvature of the membrane can be caused by the asymmetry and non-bilayer organization of lipids as discussed above. More dramatic and functional curvature is achieved through [[BAR domain]]s, which bind to [[phosphatidylinositol]] on the membrane surface, assisting in [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] formation, [[organelle]] formation and cell division.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frost A |title=The BAR domain superfamily: membrane-molding macromolecules |journal=Cell |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=191\u20136 |date=2009 |pmid=19379681 |pmc=4832598 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(09)00397-3 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.010|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Curvature development is in constant flux and contributes to the dynamic nature of biological membranes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda R |title=Bimodal spectrum for the curvature fluctuations of bilayer vesicles: pure bending plus hybrid curvature-dilation modes |journal=Phys Rev Lett |volume=102 |issue=12 |page=128101 |date=2009 |pmid=19392326 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.128101|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Lipid movement within the membrane===\nDuring the decade of 1970, it was acknowledged that individual lipid molecules undergo free lateral diffusion within each of the layers of the lipid membrane.<ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=5th |pages = 621\u2013622 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5 |year=2008 |url=http://www.garlandscience.com/garlandscience_resources/book_resources.jsf?isbn=9780815341055&landing=student |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Diffusion occurs at a high speed, with an average lipid molecule diffusing ~2&nbsp;\u00b5m, approximately the length of a large [[bacteria]]l cell, in about 1 second.<ref name=\"Alberts\"/> It has also been observed that individual lipid molecules rotate rapidly around their own axis.<ref name=\"Alberts\"/> Moreover, phospholipid molecules can, although they seldom do, migrate from one side of the lipid bilayer to the other (a process known as flip-flop). However, flip-flop might be enhanced by flippase enzymes. The processes described above influence the disordered nature of lipid molecules and interacting proteins in the lipid membranes, with consequences to membrane fluidity, signaling, trafficking and function.\n\n==Restrictions to bilayer fluidity==\nThere are restrictions to the lateral mobility of the lipid and protein components in the fluid membrane imposed by the formation of subdomains within the lipid bilayer. These subdomains arise by several processes ''e.g.'' binding of membrane components to the extracellular matrix, nanometric membrane regions with a particular biochemical composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts and protein complexes mediated by protein-protein interactions.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> Furthermore, protein-cytoskeleton associations mediate the formation of \u201ccytoskeletal fences\u201d, corrals wherein lipid and membrane proteins can diffuse freely, but that they can seldom leave.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> Restriction on lateral diffusion rates of membrane components is very important because it allows the functional specialization of particular regions within the cell membranes.\n\n===Lipid rafts===\n[[Lipid raft]]s are membrane nanometric platforms with a particular lipid and protein composition that laterally diffuse, navigating on the liquid bilipid layer. Sphingolipids and cholesterol are important building blocks of the lipid rafts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingwood D, Simons K |title=Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5961 |pages=46\u201350 |date=2010 |pmid=20044567 |doi=10.1126/science.1174621|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0576f71d2e566028fef991d2e799bb22448b7702 }}</ref>\n \n===Protein complexes===\nCell membrane proteins and glycoproteins do not exist as single elements of the lipid membrane, as first proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. Rather, they occur as diffusing complexes within the membrane.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/> The assembly of single molecules into these macromolecular complexes has important functional consequences for the cell; such as [[Membrane transport|ion and metabolite transport]], signaling, [[cell adhesion]], and [[Cell migration|migration]].<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/>\n \n===Cytoskeletal fences (corrals) and binding to the extracellular matrix===\n\nSome proteins embedded in the bilipid layer interact with the extracellular matrix outside the cell, cytoskeleton filaments inside the cell, and septin ring-like structures. These interactions have a strong influence on shape and structure, as well as on [[Cellular compartment|compartmentalization]]. Moreover, they impose physical constraints that restrict the free lateral diffusion of proteins and at least some lipids within the bilipid layer.<ref name=\"Nicolson2014\"/>\n \nWhen integral proteins of the lipid bilayer are tethered to the extracellular matrix, they are unable to diffuse freely. Proteins with a long intracellular domain may collide with a fence formed by cytoskeleton filaments.<ref>{{cite journal |author= G.
