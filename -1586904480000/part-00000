He is a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Davidson has also appeared on the [[MTV]] shows ''[[Guy Code]]'', ''[[Wild 'n Out]]'', and ''[[Failosophy]]''.<ref name=\"mtv\" /><ref name=\"nytfail\" /> He has performed stand-up comedy on ''[[Adam DeVine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', and ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"ew14\" />\n\n==Early life==\nDavidson was born November 16, 1993, in [[Staten Island|Staten Island, New York]], the son of Amy (''n\u00e9e'' Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson.<ref name=\"tvg\" /><ref name=\"sidad\" /> His father was of mostly [[Jewish]] heritage and was born to Carla DiMaggio and raised Catholic, having attended [[Catholic school]] at [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School]]; his [[memorial mass]] was held at St. Clare's Roman Catholic Church in [[Great Kills, Staten Island]]. His mother is of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic.<ref name=\"nyt\" /><ref name=\"bustle\" /> He has a younger sister named Casey.<ref name=\"si\" /><ref name=\"silive\" /> His father was a [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]] who [[Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks|died in service]] during the [[September 11 attacks]];<ref name=\"nyp\" /><ref name=\"5things\" /> he was last seen running up the stairs of the [[Marriott World Trade Center]], just before it collapsed. Davidson, then seven years old, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was \"overwhelming\" and that he later acted out in school as a result of the trauma; at one point, he ripped his hair out until he was bald.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In October 2016, Davidson revealed on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'' morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist [[Kid Cudi]] saved his life.<ref name=\"yh\" />\n\nDavidson first tried stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking [[marijuana]].<ref name=\"sfc\" /> Davidson, who has suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he \"cannot function\" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on ''Saturday Night Live'', and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that \"I can perform when I'm not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for me.\"<ref name=\"ht\" /> He attended [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School|St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School]], then [[Tottenville High School]] before transferring to [[Xaverian High School]] in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2012. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at [[St. Francis College]] in [[Brooklyn Heights]];<ref name=\"sidad\" /> after one semester Davidson dropped out to develop his career in comedy.<ref name=\"ew14\" /><ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Career==\nDavidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series ''Failosophy'', which premiered February 28, 2013.<ref name=\"hl\" /> The following month, he appeared in \"PDA and Moms,\" a third-season episode of the [[MTV2]] reality TV comedy series ''[[Guy Code]]'', the first of four episodes in which he was featured.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''Gotham Comedy Live'', which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on ''[[Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out]]'', his first of six episode appearances on that show.\n[[File:Pete Davidson in 2013.jpg|alt=Davidson looking to the side|thumb|right|Davidson in 2013]]\nDavidson subsequently made standup appearances on television and appeared in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"b99\" /> In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, ''Sober Companion'',<ref name=\"hr\" /> but it ultimately did not make it to series.<ref name=\"dh\" />\n\nDavidson joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"avc\" /> The first new addition to the cast that season,<ref name=\"ew14\" /> Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular [[Bill Hader]], whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 [[Judd Apatow]] feature film comedy ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''.<ref name=\"ewrr\" /> Hader subsequently told producer [[Lorne Michaels]] about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice,<ref name=\"ewrr\" /><ref name=\"ew\" /> with his most noted skits during the season including an ''[[Indiana Jones]]''-style sketch in which he and [[Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]], after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other's various body parts,<ref name=\"sfc\" /><ref name=\"new\" /> an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the [[69 (sex position)|\"69\" position]].<ref name=\"split\" /> Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by [[Norman Reedus]].<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' of [[Justin Bieber]], and his set was praised as one of the best of the show.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster [[Snoop Dogg]] and host [[Kevin Hart]], and their 2004 film ''[[Soul Plane]]''. Davidson, whose firefighter father died responding to the September 11 attacks, called that film \"the worst experience of my life involving a plane.\"<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn 2016, Davidson was on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 under 30]] list.<ref name=\"forbes\" />  In April of that year, [[Comedy Central]] filmed Davidson's first stand-up special ''Pete Davidson: SMD,'' in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"smd\" />\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that Davidson would be touring with [[John Mulaney]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Massachusetts]] for a limited series of comedy shows titled, \"Sundays with Pete & John.\" Mulaney and Davidson have become close appearing together on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"sundays\" /> That May, after the 44th-season finale of ''SNL'', Travis M. Andrews of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' credited Davidson with being the most memorable performer that season, and its breakout star, which Andrews attributed to Davidson's mining of his personal struggles and his admission of his comedic missteps, which Andrews felt gave the season a mixture of comedy and pathos.<ref name=\"snl44\" />\n\nDavidson collaborated with [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]] to write the sketch, \"A Message from the Count\" for Kelly's album ''[[Hotel Diablo]]''.\n\nIn February of 2020, Davidson released his stand up special ''Alive from New York'' on Netflix.<ref name=\"2020release\" />\n\n==Comedy style==\nDavidson has been praised for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to \"a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions,\" and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].<ref name=\"db\" /> Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks. He says he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ewrr\" />\n\n==Controversies==\n===Catholic Church comments===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] demanded an apology from Davidson in March, 2019, after an ''SNL'' sketch in which he compared the [[Catholic Church]] to [[R. Kelly]], an entertainer who had been accused of [[pedophilia]]. In the sketch, Davidson said \"(Kelly) is a monster and he should go to jail forever. But if you support the Catholic Church, isn't that like the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I don't really see the difference, except for one's music is significantly better.\"<ref name=\"heil2019\" /> In a statement posted on its website, the diocese criticized the \"disgraceful and offensive skit\", further opining, \"The faithful of our Church are disgusted by the harassment by those in news and entertainment, and this sketch offends millions. The mockery of this difficult time in the Church's history serves no purpose.\"<ref name=\"henderson2019\" />\n\n===Dan Crenshaw comments===\nDavidson was heavily criticized for mocking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressional candidate [[Dan Crenshaw]]'s eye patch, which he wears as a result of an injury suffered while serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL in [[Afghanistan_conflict_(1978\u2013present)#9/11_connection|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"leeman\" /> Davidson compared Crenshaw to \"a hitman in a porno movie\", and added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\"<ref name=\"hill\" /><ref name=\"nw\" /><ref name=\"republic\" /><ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"grappling\" /> \n\nIn response to public outrage over the comments, Crenshaw appeared beside Davidson the following Saturday on an ''SNL'' 'Weekend Update' segment. Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, stating, \"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it was a poor choice of words... the man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\" Crenshaw accepted Davidson's apology and called on Americans to \"never forget\" the service and sacrifices of veterans.<ref name=\"accept\" /> Crenshaw also paid tribute to Davidson's father, a firefighter who had been killed on 9/11.<ref name=\"apology\" /> Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke and the subsequent attention may have helped him win [[Texas's 2nd congressional district]] in the 2018 midterm election.<ref name=\"wapo\" /><ref name=\"esquire\" /> \n\nIn his 2020 [[Netflix]] special ''Alive from New York'', Davidson rescinded the apology previously issued to Crenshaw, implying that it had been issued only because he had been compelled to.<ref name=\"p6apology\" /><ref name=\"hillapology\" /> In the performance, Davidson tells the audience, \"I didn't think I did anything wrong. It was like words that were twisted so that a guy could be famous... So I made fun of this guy with an eye patch and then, like, I kind of got forced to apologize.\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" /> Crenshaw responded by stating that although he had initially hoped that Davidson's apology had been sincere, \"you can never tell with comedians\". Crenshaw added, \"To be fair, if we took everything that comedians said on a Netflix special seriously, man our country would be in a world of hurt. I would like to remember the guy that I saw in person and hung out with that night (on ''SNL'').\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn October 2015, Davidson lived in [[Brooklyn Heights|Brooklyn Heights, New York]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> As of April 2019, he lives in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] with his mother in a home they purchased together.<ref name=\"lonely\" /><ref name=\"ad\" /><ref name=\"mom\" />\n\nHis father was a [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center#Firefighters|firefighter and first-responder]] who died as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nDavidson supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his [[Instagram]] account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his \"hero\", a \"badass\", and \"one of the strongest people in the universe.\" Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, joking, \"This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years.\"<ref name=\"us\" />\n\nBy August 2018, Davidson had over 40&nbsp;tattoos on his arms, legs, chest, hands, and neck.<ref name=\"cosmo\" />\n\nHe was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]] at age 17 or 18,<ref name=\"ht\" /> for which he receives intravenous treatment,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> and used [[medical marijuana]] as a pain reliever.<ref name=\"ht\" /> On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years.<ref name=\"yh\" /> During an interview on comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by [[borderline personality disorder]], for which he has since been undergoing treatment.<ref name=\"wtf\" /><ref name=\"usmag\" />\n\nOn December 15, 2018, Davidson shared a candid [[Instagram]] post in which he expressed thoughts of suicide, before deleting his account on the social media platform entirely.<ref name=\"bully\" /> Concern from [[Ariana Grande]], his friends and Internet users resulted in the [[New York Police Department]] conducting a wellness check on Davidson, who was found safe at the studios for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"account\" /> Davidson only appeared live once on that night's episode of ''SNL'', when he introduced a musical performance by [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Sean Lennon]].<ref name=\"var\" /> Davidson returned to ''SNL'' the following episode, January 19, 2019, and on the ''Weekend Update'' segment he appeared alongside comedian and former ''SNL'' writer [[John Mulaney]] in which they made a reference to his Instagram post.<ref name=\"return\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\nDavidson dated comedian [[Carly Aquilino]] from 2014 until 2015,<ref name=\"hl\" /> and dated Cazzie David from 2016 to 2018.<ref name=\"people\" /><ref name=\"cut\" /><ref name=\"nylon\" /> On June 20, 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and singer and actress Ariana Grande were engaged to be married.<ref name=\"usat\" /> On October 14, 2018, it was reported that the engagement was called off.<ref name=\"cnn\" /><ref name=\"ewsplit\" /><ref name=\"usa\" /> Grande's song \"[[Pete Davidson (song)|Pete Davidson]]\" appears on her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]''.

He is a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Davidson has also appeared on the [[MTV]] shows ''[[Guy Code]]'', ''[[Wild 'n Out]]'', and ''[[Failosophy]]''.<ref name=\"mtv\" /><ref name=\"nytfail\" /> He has performed stand-up comedy on ''[[Adam DeVine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', and ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"ew14\" />\n\n==Early life==\nDavidson was born November 16, 1993, in [[Staten Island|Staten Island, New York]], the son of Amy (''n\u00e9e'' Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson.<ref name=\"tvg\" /><ref name=\"sidad\" /> His father was of mostly [[Jewish]] heritage and was born to Carla DiMaggio and raised Catholic, having attended [[Catholic school]] at [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School]]; his [[memorial mass]] was held at St. Clare's Roman Catholic Church in [[Great Kills, Staten Island]]. His mother is of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic.<ref name=\"nyt\" /><ref name=\"bustle\" /> He has a younger sister named Casey.<ref name=\"si\" /><ref name=\"silive\" /> His father was a [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]] who [[Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks|died in service]] during the [[September 11 attacks]];<ref name=\"nyp\" /><ref name=\"5things\" /> he was last seen running up the stairs of the [[Marriott World Trade Center]], just before it collapsed. Davidson, then seven years old, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was \"overwhelming\" and that he later acted out in school as a result of the trauma; at one point, he ripped his hair out until he was bald.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In October 2016, Davidson revealed on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'' morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist [[Kid Cudi]] saved his life.<ref name=\"yh\" />\n\nDavidson first tried stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking [[marijuana]].<ref name=\"sfc\" /> Davidson, who has suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he \"cannot function\" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on ''Saturday Night Live'', and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that \"I can perform when I'm not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for me.\"<ref name=\"ht\" /> He attended [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School|St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School]], then [[Tottenville High School]] before transferring to [[Xaverian High School]] in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2012. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at [[St. Francis College]] in [[Brooklyn Heights]];<ref name=\"sidad\" /> after one semester Davidson dropped out to develop his career in comedy.<ref name=\"ew14\" /><ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Career==\nDavidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series ''Failosophy'', which premiered February 28, 2013.<ref name=\"hl\" /> The following month, he appeared in \"PDA and Moms,\" a third-season episode of the [[MTV2]] reality TV comedy series ''[[Guy Code]]'', the first of four episodes in which he was featured.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''Gotham Comedy Live'', which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on ''[[Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out]]'', his first of six episode appearances on that show.\n[[File:Pete Davidson in 2013.jpg|alt=Davidson looking to the side|thumb|right|Davidson in 2013]]\nDavidson subsequently made standup appearances on television and appeared in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"b99\" /> In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, ''Sober Companion'',<ref name=\"hr\" /> but it ultimately did not make it to series.<ref name=\"dh\" />\n\nDavidson joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"avc\" /> The first new addition to the cast that season,<ref name=\"ew14\" /> Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular [[Bill Hader]], whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 [[Judd Apatow]] feature film comedy ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''.<ref name=\"ewrr\" /> Hader subsequently told producer [[Lorne Michaels]] about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice,<ref name=\"ewrr\" /><ref name=\"ew\" /> with his most noted skits during the season including an ''[[Indiana Jones]]''-style sketch in which he and [[Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]], after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other's various body parts,<ref name=\"sfc\" /><ref name=\"new\" /> an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the [[69 (sex position)|\"69\" position]].<ref name=\"split\" /> Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by [[Norman Reedus]].<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' of [[Justin Bieber]], and his set was praised as one of the best of the show.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster [[Snoop Dogg]] and host [[Kevin Hart]], and their 2004 film ''[[Soul Plane]]''. Davidson, whose firefighter father died responding to the September 11 attacks, called that film \"the worst experience of my life involving a plane.\"<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn 2016, Davidson was on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 under 30]] list.<ref name=\"forbes\" />  In April of that year, [[Comedy Central]] filmed Davidson's first stand-up special ''Pete Davidson: SMD,'' in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"smd\" />\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that Davidson would be touring with [[John Mulaney]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Massachusetts]] for a limited series of comedy shows titled, \"Sundays with Pete & John.\" Mulaney and Davidson have become close appearing together on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"sundays\" /> That May, after the 44th-season finale of ''SNL'', Travis M. Andrews of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' credited Davidson with being the most memorable performer that season, and its breakout star, which Andrews attributed to Davidson's mining of his personal struggles and his admission of his comedic missteps, which Andrews felt gave the season a mixture of comedy and pathos.<ref name=\"snl44\" />\n\nDavidson collaborated with [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]] to write the sketch, \"A Message from the Count\" for Kelly's album ''[[Hotel Diablo]]''.\n\nIn February of 2020, Davidson released his stand up special ''Alive from New York'' on Netflix.<ref name=\"2020release\" />\n\n==Comedy style==\nDavidson has been praised for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to \"a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions,\" and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].<ref name=\"db\" /> Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks. He says he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ewrr\" />\n\n==Controversies==\n===Catholic Church comments===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] demanded an apology from Davidson in March, 2019, after an ''SNL'' sketch in which he compared the [[Catholic Church]] to [[R. Kelly]], an entertainer who had been accused of [[pedophilia]]. In the sketch, Davidson said \"(Kelly) is a monster and he should go to jail forever. But if you support the Catholic Church, isn't that like the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I don't really see the difference, except for one's music is significantly better.\"<ref name=\"heil2019\" /> In a statement posted on its website, the diocese criticized the \"disgraceful and offensive skit\", further opining, \"The faithful of our Church are disgusted by the harassment by those in news and entertainment, and this sketch offends millions. The mockery of this difficult time in the Church's history serves no purpose.\"<ref name=\"henderson2019\" />\n\n===Dan Crenshaw comments===\nDavidson was heavily criticized for mocking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressional candidate [[Dan Crenshaw]]'s eye patch, which he wears as a result of an injury suffered while serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL in [[Afghanistan_conflict_(1978\u2013present)#9/11_connection|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"leeman\" /> Davidson compared Crenshaw to \"a hitman in a porno movie\", and added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\"<ref name=\"hill\" /><ref name=\"nw\" /><ref name=\"republic\" /><ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"grappling\" /> \n\nIn response to public outrage over the comments, Crenshaw appeared beside Davidson the following Saturday on an ''SNL'' 'Weekend Update' segment. Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, stating, \"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it was a poor choice of words... the man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\" Crenshaw accepted Davidson's apology and called on Americans to \"never forget\" the service and sacrifices of veterans.<ref name=\"accept\" /> Crenshaw also paid tribute to Davidson's father, a firefighter who had been killed on 9/11.<ref name=\"apology\" /> Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke and the subsequent attention may have helped him win [[Texas's 2nd congressional district]] in the 2018 midterm election.<ref name=\"wapo\" /><ref name=\"esquire\" /> \n\nIn his 2020 [[Netflix]] special ''Alive from New York'', Davidson rescinded the apology previously issued to Crenshaw, implying that it had been issued only because he had been compelled to.<ref name=\"p6apology\" /><ref name=\"hillapology\" /> In the performance, Davidson tells the audience, \"I didn't think I did anything wrong. It was like words that were twisted so that a guy could be famous... So I made fun of this guy with an eye patch and then, like, I kind of got forced to apologize.\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" /> Crenshaw responded by stating that although he had initially hoped that Davidson's apology had been sincere, \"you can never tell with comedians\". Crenshaw added, \"To be fair, if we took everything that comedians said on a Netflix special seriously, man our country would be in a world of hurt. I would like to remember the guy that I saw in person and hung out with that night (on ''SNL'').\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn October 2015, Davidson lived in [[Brooklyn Heights|Brooklyn Heights, New York]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> As of April 2019, he lives in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] with his mother in a home they purchased together.<ref name=\"lonely\" /><ref name=\"ad\" /><ref name=\"mom\" />\n\nHis father was a [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center#Firefighters|firefighter and first-responder]] who died as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nDavidson supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his [[Instagram]] account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his \"hero\", a \"badass\", and \"one of the strongest people in the universe.\" Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, joking, \"This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years.\"<ref name=\"us\" />\n\nBy August 2018, Davidson had over 40&nbsp;tattoos on his arms, legs, chest, hands, and neck.<ref name=\"cosmo\" />\n\nHe was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]] at age 17 or 18,<ref name=\"ht\" /> for which he receives intravenous treatment,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> and used [[medical marijuana]] as a pain reliever.<ref name=\"ht\" /> On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years.<ref name=\"yh\" /> During an interview on comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by [[borderline personality disorder]], for which he has since been undergoing treatment.<ref name=\"wtf\" /><ref name=\"usmag\" />\n\nOn December 15, 2018, Davidson shared a candid [[Instagram]] post in which he expressed thoughts of suicide, before deleting his account on the social media platform entirely.<ref name=\"bully\" /> Concern from [[Ariana Grande]], his friends and Internet users resulted in the [[New York Police Department]] conducting a wellness check on Davidson, who was found safe at the studios for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"account\" /> Davidson only appeared live once on that night's episode of ''SNL'', when he introduced a musical performance by [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Sean Lennon]].<ref name=\"var\" /> Davidson returned to ''SNL'' the following episode, January 19, 2019, and on the ''Weekend Update'' segment he appeared alongside comedian and former ''SNL'' writer [[John Mulaney]] in which they made a reference to his Instagram post.<ref name=\"return\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\nDavidson dated comedian [[Carly Aquilino]] from 2014 until 2015,<ref name=\"hl\" /> and dated Cazzie David from 2016 to 2018.<ref name=\"people\" /><ref name=\"cut\" /><ref name=\"nylon\" /> On June 20, 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and singer and actress Ariana Grande were engaged to be married.<ref name=\"usat\" /> On October 14, 2018, it was reported that the engagement was called off.<ref name=\"cnn\" /><ref name=\"ewsplit\" /><ref name=\"usa\" /> Grande's song \"[[Pete Davidson (song)|Pete Davidson]]\" appears on her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]''.

The latter term is generic, and refers not only to indefinite integrals (antiderivatives), but also to [[definite integral]]s. When the word ''integral'' is used without additional specification, the reader is supposed to deduce from the context whether it refers to a definite or indefinite integral.

This article adopts the latter approach.|group=Note}} of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function {{math|''F''}} whose [[derivative]] is equal to the original function {{math|''f''}}. This can be stated symbolically as <math>F' = f</math>.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/calculusearlytra00stew_1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}</ref> The process of solving for antiderivatives is called '''antidifferentiation''' (or '''indefinite integration''') and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.\n\nAntiderivatives are related to [[integral|definite integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: the definite integral of a function over an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nThe discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is [[antidifference]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe function <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^3}{3}</math> is an antiderivative of <math>f(x) = x^2</math>, as the derivative of <math>\\tfrac{x^3}{3}</math> is <math>x^2</math>. As the derivative of a [[Constant function|constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]], <math>x^2</math> will have an [[Infinite set|infinite]] number of antiderivatives, such as <math>\\tfrac{x^3}{3}, \\tfrac{x^3}{3}+1, \\tfrac{x^3}{3}-2</math>, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of <math>x^2</math> can be obtained by changing the value of {{math|''c''}} in <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^3}{3}+c</math>, where {{math|''c''}} is an arbitrary constant known as the [[constant of integration]]. Essentially, the [[graph of a function|graphs]] of antiderivatives of a given function are [[vertical translation]]s of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] {{math|''c''}}.\n\nMore generally, the [[power function]] <math>f(x) = x^n</math> has antiderivative <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c</math> if {{math|''n'' \u2260 &minus;1}}, and <math>F(x) = \\ln x + c</math> if {{math|1=''n'' = &minus;1}}.\n\nIn physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).\n\n==Uses and properties==\nAntiderivatives can be used to [[integral#Calculating integrals|compute definite integrals]], using the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: if {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of the [[Riemann integral|integrable]] function {{math|''f''}} over the interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nBecause of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function {{math|''f''}} is sometimes called the \"general integral\" or \"indefinite integral\" of ''f'' and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}}, and the function {{math|''f''}} is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''f''}} differs from {{math|''F''}} by a constant: there exists a number {{math|''c''}} such that <math>G(x) = F(x)+c</math> for all {{math|''x''}}. {{math|''c''}} is called the [[constant of integration]]. If the domain of {{math|''F''}} is a [[disjoint union]] of two or more (open) intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\begin{cases}-\\frac{1}{x}+c_1\\quad x<0\\\\-\\frac{1}{x}+c_2\\quad x>0\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis the most general antiderivative of <math>f(x)=1/x^2</math> on its natural domain <math>(-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty).</math>\n\nEvery [[continuous function]] {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative {{math|''F''}} is given by the definite integral of {{math|''f''}} with variable upper boundary:\n:<math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt.</math>\nVarying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives). This is another formulation of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].\n\nThere are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s (like [[polynomial]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[trigonometric functions]], [[inverse trigonometric functions]] and their combinations). Examples of these are\n:<math>\\int e^{-x^2}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int \\sin x^2\\,dx, \\qquad\\int \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int\\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int x^{x}\\,dx.</math>\n''From left to right, the first four are the [[error function]], the [[Fresnel function]], the [[trigonometric integral]], and the [[logarithmic integral function]].''\n\nSee also [[Differential Galois theory]] for a more detailed discussion.\n\n==Techniques of integration==\nFinding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives. For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. See the articles on [[Elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary functions]] and [[nonelementary integral]] for further information.\n\nThere are various methods available:\n\n* the [[linearity of integration]] breaks complicated integrals into simpler ones\n* [[integration by substitution]], often combined with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] or the [[natural logarithm]]\n** the [[inverse chain rule method]], a special case of integration by substitution\n* [[integration by parts]] to integrate products of functions\n* [[Inverse function integration]], a formula that expresses the antiderivative of the inverse <math>f^{-1}</math> of an invertible and continuous function <math>f</math> in terms of the antiderivative of <math>f</math> and of <math>f^{-1}</math>.\n* the method of [[partial fractions in integration]] allows us to integrate all [[rational function]]s (fractions of two polynomials)\n* the [[Risch algorithm]]\n* when integrating multiple times, certain additional techniques can be used, see for instance [[double integral]]s and [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and the [[Stokes' theorem]]\n* if a function has no elementary antiderivative (for instance, <math>\\exp (-x^2)</math>), its definite integral can be approximated using [[numerical integration]]\n* it is often convenient to algebraically manipulate the integrand such that other integration techniques, such as integration by substitution, may be used.\n* to calculate the ({{math|''n''}} times) repeated antiderivative of a function {{math|''f''}}, [[Cauchy]]'s formula is useful (cf. [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]]):\n::<math>\\int_{x_0}^x \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\dots \\int_{x_0}^{x_{n-1}} f(x_n) \\,dx_n \\dots \\, dx_2\\, dx_1= \\int_{x_0}^x f(t) \\frac{(x-t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\,dt.</math>\n\n[[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a [[table of integrals]].\n\n==Of non-continuous functions==\nNon-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:\n* Some highly [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological functions]] with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.\n* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]], while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.\n\nAssuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:\n\n* A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function {{math|''f''}} to have an antiderivative is that {{math|''f''}} have the [[intermediate value theorem|intermediate value property]]. That is, if {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a subinterval of the domain of {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''y''}} is any real number between {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}}, then there exists a {{mvar|c}} between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''c'') = ''y''}}. This is a consequence of [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]].\n\n* The set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} must be a [[meagre set]]. This set must also be an [[F-sigma]] set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type). Moreover, for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function {{math|''f''}} having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.\n\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, is [[bounded function|bounded]] on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of [[Lebesgue measure]] 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration in the sense of Lebesgue. In fact, using more powerful integrals like the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]], every function for which an antiderivative exists is integrable, and its general integral coincides with its antiderivative.\n\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''F''}} on a closed interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then for any choice of partition <math>a=x_0 <x_1 <x_2 <\\dots <x_n=b,</math> if one chooses sample points <math>x_i^*\\in[x_{i-1},x_i]</math> as specified by the [[mean value theorem]], then the corresponding Riemann sum [[telescoping series|telescopes]] to the value <math>F(b)-F(a)</math>.\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)(x_i-x_{i-1}) & = \\sum_{i=1}^n [F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})] \\\\\n& = F(x_n)-F(x_0) = F(b)-F(a)\n\\end{align}</math>\n:However if {{math|''f''}} is unbounded, or if {{math|''f''}} is bounded but the set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points <math>x_i^*</math> may give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.\n\n===Some examples===\n{{ordered list\n|1= The function\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f(0)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F(x)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F(0)=0</math>. Since {{math|''f''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0, the antiderivative {{math|''F''}} may be obtained by integration: <math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>.\n|2= The function\n\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)-\\frac{2}{x}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f(0)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F(x)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F(0)=0</math>. Unlike Example 1, {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the Riemann integral is undefined.\n\n|3= If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the function in Example 1 and {{math|''F''}} is its antiderivative, and <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> is a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] [[subset]] of the open interval <math>(-1,1),</math> then the function\n\n:<math>g(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{f(x-x_n)}{2^n}</math>\n\nhas an antiderivative\n\n:<math>G(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{F(x-x_n)}{2^n}.</math>\n\nThe set of discontinuities of {{math|''g''}} is precisely the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>. Since {{math|''g''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative {{math|''G''}} may be found by integration.\n\n|4= Let <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> be a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval <math>(-1,1).</math> Consider the everywhere continuous strictly increasing function\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2^n}(x-x_n)^{1/3}.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n:<math>F'(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{3\\cdot2^n}(x-x_n)^{-2/3}</math>\n[[Image:Antideriv1.png|125px|right|thumb|Figure 1.]]\n[[Image:Antideriv2.png|thumb|right|125px|Figure 2.]]\n\nfor all values {{math|''x''}} where the series converges, and that the graph of {{math|''F''(''x'')}} has vertical tangent lines at all other values of {{math|''x''}}. In particular the graph has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>.\n\nMoreover <math>F(x)\\ge0</math> for all {{math|''x''}} where the derivative is defined. It follows that the inverse function <math>G=F^{-1}</math> is differentiable everywhere and that\n\n:<math>g(x)=G'(x)=0</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''x''}} in the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> which is dense in the interval <math>[F(-1),F(1)].</math> Thus {{math|''g''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''G''}}. On the other hand, it can not be true that\n\n:<math>\\int_{F(-1)}^{F(1)}g(x)\\,dx=GF(1)-GF(-1)=2,</math>\n\nsince for any partition of <math>[F(-1),F(1)]</math>, one can choose sample points for the Riemann sum from the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>, giving a value of 0 for the sum. It follows that {{math|''g''}} has a set of discontinuities of positive Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to the graph of {{math|''g''(''x'')}} where <math>\\{x_n=\\cos(n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> and the series is truncated to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the antiderivative {{math|''G''(''x'')}}, also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the Riemann integral is replaced by the [[Lebesgue integral]], then [[Fatou's lemma]] or the [[dominated convergence theorem]] shows that {{math|''g''}} does satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus in that context.\n\n|5= In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions {{math|''g''}} are dense only in a finite open interval <math>(a,b).</math> However, these examples can be easily modified so as to have sets of discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math>. Let\n\n:<math>\\lambda(x) = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1} x.</math>\n\nThen <math>g(\\lambda(x))\\lambda'(x)</math> has a dense set of discontinuities on <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math> and has antiderivative <math>G\\cdot\\lambda.</math>\n\n|6= Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify {{math|''g''}} in Example 4 so as to vanish at all [[rational numbers]]. If one uses a naive version of the [[Riemann integral]] defined as the limit of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the integral of such a function {{math|''g''}} over an interval <math>[a,b]</math> is 0 whenever {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both rational, instead of <math>G(b)-G(a)</math>. Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.\n\n|7= A function which has an antiderivative may still fail to be Riemann integrable.  The derivative of [[Volterra's function]] is an example.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiderivative (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Lists of integrals]]\n* [[Symbolic integration]]\n* [[Area]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references\">\n<references />\n</div>\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Introduction to Classical Real Analysis'', by Karl R.

This article adopts the latter approach.|group=Note}} of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function {{math|''F''}} whose [[derivative]] is equal to the original function {{math|''f''}}. This can be stated symbolically as <math>F' = f</math>.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/calculusearlytra00stew_1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}</ref> The process of solving for antiderivatives is called '''antidifferentiation''' (or '''indefinite integration''') and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.\n\nAntiderivatives are related to [[integral|definite integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: the definite integral of a function over an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nThe discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is [[antidifference]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe function <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^3}{3}</math> is an antiderivative of <math>f(x) = x^2</math>, as the derivative of <math>\\tfrac{x^3}{3}</math> is <math>x^2</math>. As the derivative of a [[Constant function|constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]], <math>x^2</math> will have an [[Infinite set|infinite]] number of antiderivatives, such as <math>\\tfrac{x^3}{3}, \\tfrac{x^3}{3}+1, \\tfrac{x^3}{3}-2</math>, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of <math>x^2</math> can be obtained by changing the value of {{math|''c''}} in <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^3}{3}+c</math>, where {{math|''c''}} is an arbitrary constant known as the [[constant of integration]]. Essentially, the [[graph of a function|graphs]] of antiderivatives of a given function are [[vertical translation]]s of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] {{math|''c''}}.\n\nMore generally, the [[power function]] <math>f(x) = x^n</math> has antiderivative <math>F(x) = \\tfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c</math> if {{math|''n'' \u2260 &minus;1}}, and <math>F(x) = \\ln x + c</math> if {{math|1=''n'' = &minus;1}}.\n\nIn physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).\n\n==Uses and properties==\nAntiderivatives can be used to [[integral#Calculating integrals|compute definite integrals]], using the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: if {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of the [[Riemann integral|integrable]] function {{math|''f''}} over the interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nBecause of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function {{math|''f''}} is sometimes called the \"general integral\" or \"indefinite integral\" of ''f'' and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} is an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}}, and the function {{math|''f''}} is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''f''}} differs from {{math|''F''}} by a constant: there exists a number {{math|''c''}} such that <math>G(x) = F(x)+c</math> for all {{math|''x''}}. {{math|''c''}} is called the [[constant of integration]]. If the domain of {{math|''F''}} is a [[disjoint union]] of two or more (open) intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\begin{cases}-\\frac{1}{x}+c_1\\quad x<0\\\\-\\frac{1}{x}+c_2\\quad x>0\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis the most general antiderivative of <math>f(x)=1/x^2</math> on its natural domain <math>(-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty).</math>\n\nEvery [[continuous function]] {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative {{math|''F''}} is given by the definite integral of {{math|''f''}} with variable upper boundary:\n:<math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt.</math>\nVarying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives). This is another formulation of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].\n\nThere are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s (like [[polynomial]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[trigonometric functions]], [[inverse trigonometric functions]] and their combinations). Examples of these are\n:<math>\\int e^{-x^2}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int \\sin x^2\\,dx, \\qquad\\int \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int\\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\,dx,\\qquad \\int x^{x}\\,dx.</math>\n''From left to right, the first four are the [[error function]], the [[Fresnel function]], the [[trigonometric integral]], and the [[logarithmic integral function]].''\n\nSee also [[Differential Galois theory]] for a more detailed discussion.\n\n==Techniques of integration==\nFinding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives. For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. See the articles on [[Elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary functions]] and [[nonelementary integral]] for further information.\n\nThere are various methods available:\n\n* the [[linearity of integration]] allows us to break complicated integrals into simpler ones\n* [[integration by substitution]], often combined with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] or the [[natural logarithm]]\n** the [[inverse chain rule method]], a special case of integration by substitution\n* [[integration by parts]] to integrate products of functions\n* [[Inverse function integration]], a formula that expresses the antiderivative of the inverse <math>f^{-1}</math> of an invertible and continuous function <math>f</math> in terms of the antiderivative of <math>f</math> and of <math>f^{-1}</math>.\n* the method of [[partial fractions in integration]] allows us to integrate all [[rational function]]s (fractions of two polynomials)\n* the [[Risch algorithm]]\n* when integrating multiple times, certain additional techniques can be used, see for instance [[double integral]]s and [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and the [[Stokes' theorem]]\n* if a function has no elementary antiderivative (for instance, <math>\\exp (-x^2)</math>), its definite integral can be approximated using [[numerical integration]]\n* it is often convenient to algebraically manipulate the integrand such that other integration techniques, such as integration by substitution, may be used.\n* to calculate the ({{math|''n''}} times) repeated antiderivative of a function {{math|''f''}}, [[Cauchy]]'s formula is useful (cf. [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]]):\n::<math>\\int_{x_0}^x \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\dots \\int_{x_0}^{x_{n-1}} f(x_n) \\,dx_n \\dots \\, dx_2\\, dx_1= \\int_{x_0}^x f(t) \\frac{(x-t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\,dt.</math>\n\n[[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a [[table of integrals]].\n\n==Of non-continuous functions==\nNon-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:\n* Some highly [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological functions]] with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.\n* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]], while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.\n\nAssuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:\n\n* A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function {{math|''f''}} to have an antiderivative is that {{math|''f''}} have the [[intermediate value theorem|intermediate value property]]. That is, if {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a subinterval of the domain of {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''y''}} is any real number between {{math|''f''(''a'')}} and {{math|''f''(''b'')}}, then there exists a {{mvar|c}} between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''c'') = ''y''}}. This is a consequence of [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]].\n\n* The set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} must be a [[meagre set]]. This set must also be an [[F-sigma]] set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type). Moreover, for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function {{math|''f''}} having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.\n\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative, is [[bounded function|bounded]] on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of [[Lebesgue measure]] 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration in the sense of Lebesgue. In fact, using more powerful integrals like the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]], every function for which an antiderivative exists is integrable, and its general integral coincides with its antiderivative.\n\n* If {{math|''f''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''F''}} on a closed interval <math>[a,b]</math>, then for any choice of partition <math>a=x_0 <x_1 <x_2 <\\dots <x_n=b,</math> if one chooses sample points <math>x_i^*\\in[x_{i-1},x_i]</math> as specified by the [[mean value theorem]], then the corresponding Riemann sum [[telescoping series|telescopes]] to the value <math>F(b)-F(a)</math>.\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)(x_i-x_{i-1}) & = \\sum_{i=1}^n [F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})] \\\\\n& = F(x_n)-F(x_0) = F(b)-F(a)\n\\end{align}</math>\n:However if {{math|''f''}} is unbounded, or if {{math|''f''}} is bounded but the set of discontinuities of {{math|''f''}} has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points <math>x_i^*</math> may give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.\n\n===Some examples===\n{{ordered list\n|1= The function\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f(0)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F(x)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F(0)=0</math>. Since {{math|''f''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0, the antiderivative {{math|''F''}} may be obtained by integration: <math>F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>.\n|2= The function\n\n:<math>f(x)=2x\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)-\\frac{2}{x}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>f(0)=0</math> is not continuous at <math>x=0</math> but has the antiderivative\n\n:<math>F(x)=x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)</math>\n\nwith <math>F(0)=0</math>. Unlike Example 1, {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the Riemann integral is undefined.\n\n|3= If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the function in Example 1 and {{math|''F''}} is its antiderivative, and <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> is a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] [[subset]] of the open interval <math>(-1,1),</math> then the function\n\n:<math>g(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{f(x-x_n)}{2^n}</math>\n\nhas an antiderivative\n\n:<math>G(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{F(x-x_n)}{2^n}.</math>\n\nThe set of discontinuities of {{math|''g''}} is precisely the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>. Since {{math|''g''}} is bounded on closed finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative {{math|''G''}} may be found by integration.\n\n|4= Let <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> be a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval <math>(-1,1).</math> Consider the everywhere continuous strictly increasing function\n\n:<math>F(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2^n}(x-x_n)^{1/3}.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n:<math>F'(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{3\\cdot2^n}(x-x_n)^{-2/3}</math>\n[[Image:Antideriv1.png|125px|right|thumb|Figure 1.]]\n[[Image:Antideriv2.png|thumb|right|125px|Figure 2.]]\n\nfor all values {{math|''x''}} where the series converges, and that the graph of {{math|''F''(''x'')}} has vertical tangent lines at all other values of {{math|''x''}}. In particular the graph has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set <math>\\{x_n\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>.\n\nMoreover <math>F(x)\\ge0</math> for all {{math|''x''}} where the derivative is defined. It follows that the inverse function <math>G=F^{-1}</math> is differentiable everywhere and that\n\n:<math>g(x)=G'(x)=0</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''x''}} in the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> which is dense in the interval <math>[F(-1),F(1)].</math> Thus {{math|''g''}} has an antiderivative {{math|''G''}}. On the other hand, it can not be true that\n\n:<math>\\int_{F(-1)}^{F(1)}g(x)\\,dx=GF(1)-GF(-1)=2,</math>\n\nsince for any partition of <math>[F(-1),F(1)]</math>, one can choose sample points for the Riemann sum from the set <math>\\{F(x_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math>, giving a value of 0 for the sum. It follows that {{math|''g''}} has a set of discontinuities of positive Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to the graph of {{math|''g''(''x'')}} where <math>\\{x_n=\\cos(n)\\}_{n\\ge1}</math> and the series is truncated to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the antiderivative {{math|''G''(''x'')}}, also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the Riemann integral is replaced by the [[Lebesgue integral]], then [[Fatou's lemma]] or the [[dominated convergence theorem]] shows that {{math|''g''}} does satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus in that context.\n\n|5= In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions {{math|''g''}} are dense only in a finite open interval <math>(a,b).</math> However, these examples can be easily modified so as to have sets of discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math>. Let\n\n:<math>\\lambda(x) = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1} x.</math>\n\nThen <math>g(\\lambda(x))\\lambda'(x)</math> has a dense set of discontinuities on <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math> and has antiderivative <math>G\\cdot\\lambda.</math>\n\n|6= Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify {{math|''g''}} in Example 4 so as to vanish at all [[rational numbers]]. If one uses a naive version of the [[Riemann integral]] defined as the limit of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the integral of such a function {{math|''g''}} over an interval <math>[a,b]</math> is 0 whenever {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both rational, instead of <math>G(b)-G(a)</math>. Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.\n\n|7= A function which has an antiderivative may still fail to be Riemann integrable.  The derivative of [[Volterra's function]] is an example.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiderivative (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Lists of integrals]]\n* [[Symbolic integration]]\n* [[Area]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references\">\n<references />\n</div>\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Introduction to Classical Real Analysis'', by Karl R.
