The construction, designed by architect F. G. Muntureanu, who studied in England, is an architectural jewel of elegant sobriety, combining several styles: from the [[Br\u00e2ncovenesc style|br\u00e2ncovenesc]] to the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] English one. It is not by chance that Laz\u0103r has been compared to the [[Paris]]ian high schools near the [[Jardin du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Garden]].\n\nIn [[1931]], the new wing of the high school was built at the initiative of the general assembly of parents, which allowed the development of new laboratories, the elegant amphitheatre, the semi-basement buffet. In the [[Stalinist era|Stalinist Era]], the high school suffered. First, it was given a number instead of its old name: it became Middle School No. 22. It shared the building with a new girls' school and in [[1949]] the high school was transferred, along with the archive and everything else (paintings by former directors, books, documents, commemorative plaques), at the former high school \"Spiru Haret\". Mechanic Gheorghe Dinu  saved from destruction the Book of Honor of the high school, hiding it in the attic of the school. In [[1955]] the ministry decided to return to the old name, the resumption of possession of the place and the establishment of mixed schools.\n\nSome remarkable achievements of the 1990-1997 period are the radical strengthening the school's building under the administration of principal Nicolae Novac, the high school's affiliation to [[UNESCO]] (1992), twinning with the French high school \"Jean Monnet\" in [[Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours|Jou\u00e9-les-Tours]], protocol initiated and consolidated by Prof. Roxana Veleanovici (1991), receiving the National College title (1995).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teenpress.ro/liceul-meu/colegiul-national-gheorghe-lazar/|title=Colegiul National \"Gheorghe Lazar\" {{!}} Teen Press|language=ro-RO|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cnlazar.ro/index.php/cuvantul-directorilor/istoric/|title=Istoric C.N.

The construction, designed by architect F. G. Muntureanu, who studied in England, is an architectural jewel of elegant sobriety, combining several styles: from the [[Br\u00e2ncovenesc style|br\u00e2ncovenesc]] to the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] English one. It is not by chance that Laz\u0103r has been compared to the [[Paris]]ian high schools near the [[Jardin du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Garden]].\n\nIn [[1931]], the new wing of the high school was built at the initiative of the general assembly of parents, which allowed the development of new laboratories, the elegant amphitheatre, the semi-basement buffet. In the [[Stalinist era|Stalinist Era]], the high school suffered. First, it was given a number instead of its old name: it became Middle School No. 22. It shared the building with a new girls' school and in [[1949]] the high school was transferred, along with the archive and everything else (paintings by former directors, books, documents, commemorative plaques), at the former high school \"Spiru Haret\". Mechanic Gheorghe Dinu  saved from destruction the Book of Honor of the high school, hiding it in the attic of the school. In [[1955]] the ministry decided to return to the old name, the resumption of possession of the place and the establishment of mixed schools.\n\nSome remarkable achievements of the 1990-1997 period are the radical strengthening the school's building under the administration of principal Nicolae Novac, the high school's affiliation to [[UNESCO]] (1992), twinning with the French high school \"Jean Monnet\" in [[Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours|Jou\u00e9-les-Tours]], protocol initiated and consolidated by Prof. Roxana Veleanovici (1991), receiving the National College title (1995).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teenpress.ro/liceul-meu/colegiul-national-gheorghe-lazar/|title=Colegiul National \"Gheorghe Lazar\" {{!}} Teen Press|language=ro-RO|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cnlazar.ro/index.php/cuvantul-directorilor/istoric/|title=Istoric C.N.

He is best remembered for two film roles: Victor Laszlo in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and Jerry Durrance in ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', both released in 1942.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Paul Georg Julius Hernried in the city of [[Trieste]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (now [[Italy]]), Henreid was the son of Maria-Luise (Lendecke) and Karl Alphons Hernried, a Viennese banker, born as Carl Hirsch, who converted in 1904{{fact|date=December 2017}} from Judaism to Roman Catholicism, due to anti-semitism.

He began his film career acting in German and Austrian films in the 1930s. During that period, he was strongly anti-[[Nazi]], so much so that he was later designated an \"official enemy of the [[Third Reich]]\".<ref name=LAT/>\n\n===England===\nIn 1937 Henreid played [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in the stage production ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'' in 1937.<ref name=NYT/>  With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Henreid risked deportation or internment as an [[enemy alien]], but [[Conrad Veidt]] (his co-star as Major Heinrich Strasser in [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]) spoke for him, and he was allowed to remain and work in England's film industry. Veidt himself was an avowed anti-Nazi, with a Jewish wife.<ref name=wof>{{cite web| title=Paul Henreid| url=http://www.walkoffame.com/paul-henreid| website=Hollywood Walk of Fame| accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> Thanks to such support, Henreid was able to continue his work in British films. In 1939 he had a notable supporting role as Staefel in ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' and the next year third billing as a German espionage agent in the thriller ''[[Night Train to Munich]]''. In 1940 he also performed in a minor role in the British musical comedy spy film ''[[Under Your Hat]]''.\n\n===RKO, Warner Bros., and MGM===\nAfter relocating to the United States and having a successful run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Flight to the West'', Henreid was put under contract by [[RKO]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/flight-to-the-west-1051 |title=Flight to the West |website=[[Internet Broadway Database]]}} as \"Paul Hernried\" (cast not verified)</ref> The studio changed his name from von Hernried to the simpler and less overtly Germanic Henreid. That year, Henreid became a citizen of the United States.<ref name=NYT/> His first film for the studio was ''[[Joan of Paris]]'', released in 1942, that became a big hit.<ref>{{cite web| title=Paul Henreid: Biography| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/84846%7C121933/Paul-Henreid/| website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]| accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoving to [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942, Henreid was cast in ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', playing the romantic lead opposite [[Bette Davis]]. His next role was as Victor Laszlo, a heroic anti-German resistance leader on the run, in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Warners then tried to consolidate Henreid's new status by co-starring him with [[Ida Lupino]] in a romantic drama, ''[[In Our Time (1944 film)|In Our Time]]'' (1944) then putting him in ''[[Between Two Worlds (1944 film)|Between Two Worlds]]'' (1944), a remake of ''[[Outward Bound (film)|Outward Bound]]''. ''[[The Conspirators (1944 film)|The Conspirators]]'' (1944) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''Casablanca'' with Henreid fighting Nazis in an ostensible neutral city with a supporting cast that included [[Sydney Greenstreet]] and [[Peter Lorre]].\n\nHenreid returned briefly to RKO to play a pirate swashbuckler in the studio's 1945 release ''[[The Spanish Main]]''. Returning to Warner Bros., he was cast the following year in ''[[Devotion (1946 film)|Devotion]]'', a [[biopic]] of the [[Bront\u00eb family]] in which Henreid portrays [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]]. He was next cast opposite [[Eleanor Parker]] in an adaptation of ''[[Of Human Bondage (1946 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1946). [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] then borrowed Henreid from Warners play [[Robert Schumann]] in ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1947) opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]].\n\n===Blacklisting and brief return to European films===\nIn his 1984 autobiography ''Ladies Man'' Henreid recounts that he was one of a group of Hollywood stars who went to Washington to protest the excesses of the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], following which he was semi-blacklisted.<ref name=NYT/> \n\nAfter leaving [[Warner Bros.]], Henreid decided to turn producer, making the [[film noir]] ''[[Hollow Triumph]]'' (1948) in which he also appeared. He was a villain in a [[Burt Lancaster]] adventure film ''[[Rope of Sand]]'' (1949). In 1950 he made a low-budget film for [[The Danzigers|Edward and Harry Danziger]], ''[[So Young, So Bad]]'', which was followed by an offer from [[Sam Katzman]] to play pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] in ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950).<ref>{{cite news| title=Drama: Paul Henreid to Star as Pirate; Bel Geddes, Ball Both Stagebound| last=Schallert| first=Edwin| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=23 February 1950| page=A11}}</ref> He then went to France for ''[[Pardon My French (1951 film)|Pardon My French]]'' (1951) before returning to Katzman for ''[[Thief of Damascus]]'' (1951). He directed and played the lead role in ''[[For Men Only (1952 film)|For Men Only]]'' (1952). Later, in England, he made film noirs ''[[Stolen Face]]'' (1952) and ''[[Mantrap (1953 film)|Mantrap]]'' (1953), then went back to Katzman for ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953). In 1954, once again working for MGM, Henreid performed in a minor role in ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]'', his first \"A\" film in a several years. \nHe moved next to [[Columbia Pictures]], where he appeared in ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' for Katzman; and then, yet again, to MGM for a part in ''[[Meet Me in Las Vegas]]''. He also appeared at this time on Broadway in ''Festival''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Festival \u2013 Broadway Play \u2013 Original| url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/festival-2494| website=[[Internet Broadway Database]]| accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Directing and final performances===\nIn the early 1950s, Henreid began directing both film and television productions. His [[television|\"small-screen\"]] directorial credits include episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Bonanza]], [[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]],'' and ''[[The Big Valley]]''. He also directed on the \"big screen\" ''[[A Woman's Devotion]]'' (1956) in which he played a supporting role, ''[[Girls on the Loose]]'' (1958), and ''[[Live Fast, Die Young (film)|Live Fast, Die Young]]'' (1958). In 1964, he directed ''[[Dead Ringer (1964 film)|Dead Ringer]]'', which stars Bette Davis and features in a minor role Henreid's daughter Monika.\n\nWhile working as a director, Henreid continued to accept some small parts as well in ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), ''[[Holiday for Lovers]]'' (1959), ''[[Never So Few]]'' (1959), and ''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1962). Additional film appearances include ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965), ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot (film)|The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Failing of Raymond]]'' (1971). In 1973, prior to his last screen appearance in ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977), Henreid returned to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to perform in ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]''.\n\n==Personal life and legacy==\n[[File:Paul Henreid Grave.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Henreid's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica]]\n\nHenreid married Elizabeth Camilla Julia \"Lisl\" Gl\u00fcck (1908\u20131993) in 1936; the couple adopted two daughters. In 1992, at age 84, Henreid died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] after suffering a stroke.<ref name=NYT/> He was buried in nearby [[Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica|Woodlawn Cemetery]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, California in 1960, to honor Henreid's significant contributions to the entertainment industry as both an actor and director, two stars were dedicated to him and installed on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

He began his film career acting in German and Austrian films in the 1930s. During that period, he was strongly anti-[[Nazi]], so much so that he was later designated an \"official enemy of the [[Third Reich]]\".<ref name=LAT/>\n\n===England===\nIn 1937 Henreid played [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in the stage production ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'' in 1937.<ref name=NYT/>  With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Henreid risked deportation or internment as an [[enemy alien]], but [[Conrad Veidt]] (his co-star as Major Heinrich Strasser in [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]) spoke for him, and he was allowed to remain and work in England's film industry. Veidt himself was an avowed anti-Nazi, with a Jewish wife.<ref name=wof>{{cite web| title=Paul Henreid| url=http://www.walkoffame.com/paul-henreid| website=Hollywood Walk of Fame| accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> Thanks to such support, Henreid was able to continue his work in British films. In 1939 he had a notable supporting role as as Staefel in ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' and the next year third billing as a German espionage agent in the thriller ''[[Night Train to Munich]]''. In 1940 he also performed in a minor role in the British musical comedy spy film ''[[Under Your Hat]]''.\n\n===RKO, Warner Bros., and MGM===\nAfter relocating to the United States and having a successful run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Flight to the West'', Henreid was put under contract by [[RKO]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/flight-to-the-west-1051 |title=Flight to the West |website=[[Internet Broadway Database]]}} as \"Paul Hernried\" (cast not verified)</ref> The studio changed his name from von Hernried to the simpler and less overtly Germanic Henreid. That year, Henreid became a citizen of the United States.<ref name=NYT/> His first film for the studio was ''[[Joan of Paris]]'', released in 1942, that became a big hit.<ref>{{cite web| title=Paul Henreid: Biography| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/84846%7C121933/Paul-Henreid/| website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]| accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoving to [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942, Henreid was cast in ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', playing the romantic lead opposite [[Bette Davis]]. His next role was as Victor Laszlo, a heroic anti-German resistance leader on the run, in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Warners then tried to consolidate Henreid's new status by co-starring him with [[Ida Lupino]] in a romantic drama, ''[[In Our Time (1944 film)|In Our Time]]'' (1944) then putting him in ''[[Between Two Worlds (1944 film)|Between Two Worlds]]'' (1944), a remake of ''[[Outward Bound (film)|Outward Bound]]''. ''[[The Conspirators (1944 film)|The Conspirators]]'' (1944) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''Casablanca'' with Henreid fighting Nazis in an ostensible neutral city with a supporting cast that included [[Sydney Greenstreet]] and [[Peter Lorre]].\n\nHenreid returned briefly to RKO to play a pirate swashbuckler in the studio's 1945 release ''[[The Spanish Main]]''. Returning to Warner Bros., he was cast the following year in ''[[Devotion (1946 film)|Devotion]]'', a [[biopic]] of the [[Bront\u00eb family]] in which Henreid portrays [[Arthur Bell Nicholls]]. He was next cast opposite [[Eleanor Parker]] in an adaptation of ''[[Of Human Bondage (1946 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1946). [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] then borrowed Henreid from Warners play [[Robert Schumann]] in ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1947) opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]].\n\n===Blacklisting and brief return to European films===\nIn his 1984 autobiography ''Ladies Man'' Henreid recounts that he was one of a group of Hollywood stars who went to Washington to protest the excesses of the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], following which he was semi-blacklisted.<ref name=NYT/> \n\nAfter leaving [[Warner Bros.]], Henreid decided to turn producer, making the [[film noir]] ''[[Hollow Triumph]]'' (1948) in which he also appeared. He was a villain in a [[Burt Lancaster]] adventure film ''[[Rope of Sand]]'' (1949). In 1950 he made a low-budget film for [[The Danzigers|Edward and Harry Danziger]], ''[[So Young, So Bad]]'', which was followed by an offer from [[Sam Katzman]] to play pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] in ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950).<ref>{{cite news| title=Drama: Paul Henreid to Star as Pirate; Bel Geddes, Ball Both Stagebound| last=Schallert| first=Edwin| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=23 February 1950| page=A11}}</ref> He then went to France for ''[[Pardon My French (1951 film)|Pardon My French]]'' (1951) before returning to Katzman for ''[[Thief of Damascus]]'' (1951). He directed and played the lead role in ''[[For Men Only (1952 film)|For Men Only]]'' (1952). Later, in England, he made film noirs ''[[Stolen Face]]'' (1952) and ''[[Mantrap (1953 film)|Mantrap]]'' (1953), then went back to Katzman for ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953). In 1954, once again working for MGM, Henreid performed in a minor role in ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]'', his first \"A\" film in a several years. \nHe moved next to [[Columbia Pictures]], where he appeared in ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' for Katzman; and then, yet again, to MGM for a part in ''[[Meet Me in Las Vegas]]''. He also appeared at this time on Broadway in ''Festival''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Festival \u2013 Broadway Play \u2013 Original| url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/festival-2494| website=[[Internet Broadway Database]]| accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Directing and final performances===\nIn the early 1950s, Henreid began directing both film and television productions. His [[television|\"small-screen\"]] directorial credits include episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Bonanza]], [[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]],'' and ''[[The Big Valley]]''. He also directed on the \"big screen\" ''[[A Woman's Devotion]]'' (1956) in which he played a supporting role, ''[[Girls on the Loose]]'' (1958), and ''[[Live Fast, Die Young (film)|Live Fast, Die Young]]'' (1958). In 1964, he directed ''[[Dead Ringer (1964 film)|Dead Ringer]]'', which stars Bette Davis and features in a minor role Henreid's daughter Monika.\n\nWhile working as a director, Henreid continued to accept some small parts as well in ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), ''[[Holiday for Lovers]]'' (1959), ''[[Never So Few]]'' (1959), and ''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1962). Additional film appearances include ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965), ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot (film)|The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Failing of Raymond]]'' (1971). In 1973, prior to his last screen appearance in ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977), Henreid returned to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to perform in ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]''.\n\n==Personal life and legacy==\n[[File:Paul Henreid Grave.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Henreid's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica]]\n\nHenreid married Elizabeth Camilla Julia \"Lisl\" Gl\u00fcck (1908\u20131993) in 1936; the couple adopted two daughters. In 1992, at age 84, Henreid died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] after suffering a stroke.<ref name=NYT/> He was buried in nearby [[Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica|Woodlawn Cemetery]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, California in 1960, to honor Henreid's significant contributions to the entertainment industry as both an actor and director, two stars were dedicated to him and installed on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. One of those stars, which recognizes his career in film, is located at 6366 Hollywood Boulevard; the other, for television, is at 1720 Vine Street.<ref name=LATstarwalk/><ref name=wof/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Complete filmography==\n\n===As actor===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[Morgenrot (film)|Morgenrot]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Baroud]]'' (1933) as Bit Part (uncredited)\n*''Love in Morocco'' (1933) as bit part (uncredited)\n*''Hohe Schule'', aka ''[[The Secret of Cavelli]]'' (1934) as Franz von Ketterer\n*''Eva, the Factory Girl'' (1935) as Fritz\n*''...nur ein Kom\u00f6diant'' (1935) as Velthen\n*''[[Victoria the Great]]'' (1937) as uncredited minor role\n*''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1939) as Staefel\n*''Mad Men of Europe'' (1940) as Victor Brandt \n*''[[Night Train to Munich]]'' (1940) as Capt.

The film is a feature-length version of the [[Code 8 (2016 film)|2016 short film of the same name]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the public becomes aware of people with superhuman abilities known as Powers, causing the government to pass a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. They quickly become a key component of the economy, notably when constructing Lincoln City as the \"City of Tomorrow\". As the Second Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized in the face of increasing mechanization, leading to severe prejudice as they become second-class citizens. By the 1990s, a crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of desperate or trafficked Powers. Police departments begin using advanced drones, armed androids named Guardians and ever-present facial recognition software to combat Power-related crime while a city-wide Powers ban is debated.\n\nConnor Reed is a 26-year-old Class 5 Electric (electrokinetic). His mother, a Cryo (cryokinetic), has brain cancer which causes her abilities to sometimes act erratically. As Powers, they cannot afford the treatment she needs. Connor's father was also an Electric who died when he was young trying to rob a convenience store. As such, his mother has raised him never to use his abilities in front of normal people. Connor makes ends meet by working as an unregistered day laborer alongside many other Powers, using his abilities to install electrical wiring without protection. While on a job, the police arrive and order the workers to disband and a Pyro (pyrokinetic) is killed when attempting to flee arrest. Elsewhere in the city, a drug raid is conducted by detectives Park and Davis on an apartment complex owned by crime lord Marcus Sutcliffe, the local agent of The Trust and a Reader (telepath). Almost $1 million worth of product is seized, putting Sutcliffe in conflict with Wesley Cumbo, his superior in The Trust who demands their expected cut in a week's time. Reed is approached by Garrett, Sutcliffe's underling and a TK (telekinetic), and his crew for a job. Despite warnings from a fellow worker, Reed goes with them and participates in a chemical theft, shorting out the electric fence in an amazing show of power. Reed is introduced to Sutcliffe and meets Nia, Sutcliffe's supposed girlfriend. Park and Davis arrive on the scene the next day and determine that Sutcliffe is using the chemicals that were stolen to cut his remaining product, indicating he is desperate for revenue. \n\nGarrett recruits Reed, recognizing he has untapped potential, and agrees to help him earn enough money to get his mother treatment. He begins training Reed on how to use his abilities and uses him as an enforcer in the Psyke trade, while also grooming him to be more assertive, believing that normal people will always be afraid of Powers and they deserve to take what they want. Reed also grows close with the members of Garrett's crew, including Freddie, a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy, Garrett's girlfriend and a Pyro. Sutcliffe has the crew rob a bank in order to pay back The Trust, but the vault only contains $50,000, since the vault was emptied for the weekend earlier that day. Cumbo's Shifter (shapeshifter) assassin Copperhead attempts to kill Sutcliffe for not honoring his debt, but Sutcliffe's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, manages to kill them. Reed is injured in the scuffle and Nia reveals that she is a Healer, and only remains with Sutcliffe to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction in order to pay a debt. \n\nReed's mother confronts him about the stash of money he has been making working with the crew, chastising him for following in the footsteps of his father. She suddenly convulses and Reed rushes her to hospital, where the doctor tells him they will need to operate soon to remove her tumor. Park and Davis bring Reed in for questioning, encouraging him to cooperate as they have already confiscated much of the Psyke on the street, weakening Sutcliffe's influence. Davis advises they plant evidence in order to coerce Reed into informing, while Park is adamant that they cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Reed is released and goes to Garrett to suggest they raid the scheduled Psyke Run, the monthly transport of seized product for destruction, which will be worth approximately $10 million. Garrett and Reed bring the idea to Sutcliffe, where Reed demands Nia heal his mother as payment and Garrett stipulates he will be a partner again in running the Psyke trade.\n \nOn the day of the heist, the crew blocks the truck while it is inside a no-fly-zone, preventing back-up by drones that carry Guardians. Reed shorts out the truck's electronics and they manage to destroy the Guardians. As Maddy hands off the Psyke to Rhino, Sutcliffe's men execute the officers protecting the truck and turn on the crew, killing Maddy and mortally wounding Freddie before he, Garrett and Reed manage to escape. Rhino flees with the drugs while the drone pilot disregards the no-fly-zone and drops additional Guardians into the area, killing the rest of Sutcliffe's men. Freddie dies as Reed and Garrett drive away. Reed tells Garrett that Sutcliffe betrayed them because of Garrett's demands, and they part ways. Davis and Park's captain is furious that Reed was not arrested before the heist, and demands they bring in those responsible. Park visits his daughter, a TK Power, who is afraid she will be given away because she is struggling to control her abilities. Reed contacts Park and offers up Sutcliffe's hideout. The cops raid Suttcliffe's hideout while Reed and Garrett seek revenge at his escape route. After killing Rhino and Sutcliffe, Garrett takes the Psyke for himself and encourages Reed to force Nia to heal his mother. Nia pleads with Reed to let her go, as her abilities do not just heal people, but force her to take the injury or disease onto herself, meaning she can die if she attempts to heal his mother. Reed takes Nia to the hospital at gunpoint, but finally tells her to stop after he sees how painful the process is for her. Reed shares a tearful goodbye with his mother before she dies. \n\nReed drives to the police station and gives Nia his truck in order to leave the city. He decides to turn himself in to try and make up for his mistakes. Garrett hands over the Psyke to Cumbo and takes over the drug trade for The Trust in Lincoln City. Reed visits his mother's grave before he serves his sentence, while Nia has a tearful visit with her father in prison, whose debt she was paying off with Sutcliffe. Meanwhile, the Powers Ban is being voted on due to the heist while Park reluctantly accepts an award for the raid against Sutcliffe.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Connor Reed\n* [[Stephen Amell]] as Garrett Kelton\n* [[Sung Kang]] as Park\n* [[Kari Matchett]] as Mary Reed\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Marcus Suttcliffe\n* [[Alex Mallari Jr.]] as Rainer\n* [[Aaron Abrams]] as Davis\n* Kyla Kane as Nia\n* [[Laysla De Oliveira]] as Maddy\n* Vlad Alexis as Freddie\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Wesley Cumbo\n* [[Shaun Benson]] as Dixon\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2016, Robbie and Stephen Amell released a short film, ''[[Code 8 (2016 film)|Code 8]]'', which acted as a teaser for a potential feature film.

The film is a feature-length version of the [[Code 8 (2016 film)|2016 short film of the same name]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the public becomes aware of people with superhuman abilities known as Powers, causing the government to pass a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. They quickly become a key component of the economy, notably when constructing Lincoln City as the \"City of Tomorrow\". As the Second Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized in the face of increasing mechanization, leading to severe prejudice as they become second-class citizens. By the 1990s, a crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of desperate or trafficked Powers. Police departments begin using advanced drones, armed androids named Guardians and ever-present facial recognition software to combat Power-related crime while a city-wide Powers ban is debated.\n\nConnor Reed is a 26-year-old Class 5 Electric (electrokinetic). His mother, a Cryo (cryokinetic), has brain cancer which causes her abilities to sometimes act erratically. As Powers, they cannot afford the treatment she needs. Connor's father was also an Electric who died when he was young trying to rob a convenience store. As such, his mother has raised him never to use his abilities in front of normal people. Connor makes ends meet by working as an unregistered day laborer alongside many other Powers, using his abilities to install electrical wiring without protection. While on a job, the police arrive and order the workers to disband and a Pyro (pyrokinetic) is killed when attempting to flee arrest. Elsewhere in the city, a drug raid is conducted by detectives Park and Davis on an apartment complex owned by crime lord Marcus Sutcliffe, the local agent of The Trust and a Reader (telepath). Almost $1 million worth of product is seized, putting Sutcliffe in conflict with Wesley Cumbo, his superior in The Trust who demands their expected cut in a week's time. Reed is approached by Garrett, Sutcliffe's underling and a TK (telekinetic), and his crew for a job. Despite warnings from a fellow worker, Reed goes with them and participates in a chemical theft, shorting out the electric fence in an amazing show of power. Reed is introduced to Sutcliffe and meets Nia, Sutcliffe's supposed girlfriend. Park and Davis arrive on the scene the next day and determine that Sutcliffe is using the chemicals that were stolen to cut his remaining product, indicating he is desperate for revenue. \n\nGarrett recruits Reed, recognizing he has untapped potential, and agrees to help him earn enough money to get his mother treatment. He begins training Reed on how to use his abilities and uses him as an enforcer in the Psyke trade, while also grooming him to be more assertive, believing that normal people will always be afraid of Powers and they deserve to take what they want. Reed also grows close with the members of Garrett's crew, including Freddie, a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy, Garrett's girlfriend and a Pyro. Sutcliffe has the crew rob a bank in order to pay back The Trust, but the vault only contains $50,000, since the vault was emptied for the weekend earlier that day. Cumbo's Shifter (shapeshifter) assassin Copperhead attempts to kill Sutcliffe for not honoring his debt, but Sutcliffe's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, manages to kill them. Reed is injured in the scuffle and Nia reveals that she is a Healer, and only remains with Sutcliffe to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction in order to pay a debt. \n\nReed's mother confronts him about the stash of money he has been making working with the crew, chastising him for following in the footsteps of his father. She suddenly convulses and Reed rushes her to hospital, where the doctor tells him they will need to operate soon to remove her tumor. Park and Davis bring Reed in for questioning, encouraging him to cooperate as they have already confiscated much of the Psyke on the street, weakening Sutcliffe's influence. Davis advises they plant evidence in order to coerce Reed into informing, while Park is adamant that they cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Reed is released and goes to Garrett to suggest they raid the scheduled Psyke Run, the monthly transport of seized product for destruction, which will be worth approximately $10 million. Garrett and Reed bring the idea to Sutcliffe, where Reed demands Nia heal his mother as payment and Garrett stipulates he will be a partner again in running the Psyke trade.\n \nOn the day of the heist, the crew blocks the truck while it is inside a no-fly-zone, preventing back-up by drones that carry Guardians. Reed shorts out the truck's electronics and they manage to destroy the Guardians. As Maddy hands off the Psyke to Rhino, Sutcliffe's men execute the officers protecting the truck and turn on the crew, killing Maddy and mortally wounding Freddie before he, Garrett and Reed manage to escape. Rhino flees with the drugs while the drone pilot disregards the no-fly-zone and drops additional Guardians into the area, killing the rest of Sutcliffe's men.

In the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] were slowly becoming the primary theories of Russian political thought, and Mikhaylovsky, realizing this shift in thought, began to tweak his original ideas of Narodnism, such that two groups of Narodniks emerged: the so-called \"Critical Narodniks\" and \"Doctrinaire Narodniks\". Critical Narodniks followed Mikhaylovsky, and assumed a very flexible stance on capitalism, whilst adhering to their basic orientation. The more well-known Doctrinaire Narodniks had a firm belief that capitalism had no future in Russia or in any [[agrarian country]].\n\nNarodnichestvo arose after the [[emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in 1861 under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], which signaled the end of [[feudalism]] in Russia. Arguing that freed serfs were being sold into [[wage slavery]], in which the [[bourgeoisie]] had replaced [[landowner]]s, Narodnism aimed to become a political force opposed to the phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They supported the existing ''[[obshchina]]'' system of [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]s and wanted to strengthen peasant self-governance.\n\nNarodniki established semi-underground circles (\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043a\u0438) such as the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky|Chaikovsky Circle]] and [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]], with the goals of self-education and external propaganda work. They shared the common general aims of destroying the [[Russian Empire|Russian monarchy]] and of distributing land fairly among the peasantry. The Narodniks generally believed that it was possible to forgo the capitalist phase of Russia's development and proceed directly to [[socialism]].\n\nThe Narodniks saw the peasantry as the [[Working class|revolutionary class]] that would overthrow the monarchy, and perceived the village commune as the embryo of socialism.

The Bakunists believed revolution among the peasantry and populist uprisings in Russia would begin in the immediate future, the latter believed that propaganda should precede revolution, and the process would be more gradual.<ref>Pedler, Anne, The Slavonic Review, Vol. 6, No. 16 (Jun., 1927), pp. 130-141 Published by: the Modern Humanities Research Association and University College London, School of Slavonic and East European Studies</ref>  Bakunists believed that the peasants were ready to revolt with little propagandizing, whereas the Lavrists thought that considerable effort would be needed for the uprisings to begin. A lack of ideological unity resulted in varied approaches to the movement, and because of this the Narodniks no longer presented a united front to rural Russia. Some Narodniks believed in propagandizing by staying in one area for an extended period of time and assimilating into a commune that they were trying to revolutionize (\u201csettled\u201d propaganda), and others practiced propagandizing by using pamphlets and literature to maximize the number of people that the message reached (\u201cflying\u201d propaganda). \n\nDisunity was prevalent even though Narodniks only traveled in three directions: either towards [[Volga River|Volga]], [[Dnieper]], or [[Don River (Russia)|Don]].<ref name=\"Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141\">Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141.</ref>  The Narodniki, who often took up work as nurses, scribes, schoolteachers, or participated in construction and harvest, struggled in unfamiliar terrain and poverty. All Narodniks resented foreign intervention into Russia, wanted Russian communes to control their own economic policies. Narodniks believed that the Tsar had impoverished the peasants, but Narodniks should have understood how highly the peasants regarded the Tsar. By failing to present a disciplined message and avoid directly attacking the Tsar, the Narodniki was often simply ignored.<ref>Siljak, Ana.

New York: Griffin ; 2010. 48.</ref>  It was not until the formation of Narodnaya Volya in 1879 that young revolutionaries saw the need for organization and a disciplined message.<ref>Thaden, Edward C. Russia since 1801: the making of a new society. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1971. 335-350.</ref>\n\nThis lack of unity is responsible for the third reason that the \u201cgoing to the people movement\u201d failed; the peasants did not receive the intellectuals well. The reception that the [[intelligentsia]] received in the communes was so poor that it destroyed their idealized image of the peasant that was so common prior to 1874. The Narodniks saw peasants as a unified body; they thought that all peasants dressed poorly, so intellectuals dressed as poorly as was possible in order to fit in. In actuality, the peasants saw a poorly dressed person as a person with no authority or credibility. Accordingly, intellectuals dressing as they imagined the peasant dressed had an adverse effect; it actually made peasants suspicious of the intellectuals. Furthermore, Narodnik propaganda failed to address the more mundane, ordinary concerns of the peasantry. The everyday troubles of a rural Russian\u2014a lack of material goods, poor healthcare, etc.\u2014left  little time for discussions of [[socialism]] or [[Egotism|egoism]].<ref>See Frierson, Cathy A. Peasant Icons: Representations of Rural People in Late Nineteenth Century Russia. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 68.</ref>\n\n[[Feminism]] in the Narodnik movement was also hard for the peasantry to accept. Pre-Marxist revolutionaries believed in an unusually strong [[Gender equality|equality of sex]], and educated noblewomen played major roles in radical movements in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Russian revolutionary literature in the 1840s and 1850s linked the causes of emancipation of [[serfs]] with the emancipation of the Russian woman\u2014this literature was manifest in the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks promulgated Chernyshevskyan ideas of chaste cohabitation\u2014that men and women should live together with no sexual interactions\u2014and gender equality. These concepts were extremely odd to most peasants, and they did not generally react well to them. Furthermore, Narodniks often lived in communes where non-married men and women slept and lived in the same rooms. To Orthodox Russian peasants in the 1870s, such disregard of gender norms were both offensive and off-putting. When you consider the fact that nearly 60% of Narodnik women were from wealthy classes it becomes clear why the Russian peasant could not relate to most intellectuals in the movement intellectually, economically or socially.<ref>Information on sex in the Narodnik movement was drawn from Robert H. McNeal Journal of Social History, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Winter, 1971-1972), pp. 143-163 Published by: Oxford University Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3786408</ref>  Historian Dmitri Pisarev writes that \u201csensing their inability to act alone, the intelligent radical made the peasantry the instrument to realize their hopes.\u201d As historian Daniel Field wrote, however, \u201cNarodniks found that the peasant desire for land was not accompanied by a wish to rebel.\u201d<ref>See Field, Daniel. Peasants and Propagandists in the Russian Movement to the People in 1874. London, U.K.: Garland Publishing Company, 1992. 423.</ref>  The Russian government did not look favorably on the Narodniks advocating their overthrow, and peasants would only abide Narodniks so long as no criminal connections could be drawn to them. The Narodniks believed that the peasants were the class in Russia most prone to revolution, yet the peasants were not ready for revolutionary action.<ref>See http://s4ss.org/342/remembering-nikolai-tchaikovsky-lessons-from-the-narodniks/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013351/http://s4ss.org/342/remembering-nikolai-tchaikovsky-lessons-from-the-narodniks/ |date=2014-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nGovernment suppression of the Narodniki resulted in mass trials that widely publicized the views of the Narodniki, and outraged the public. Between 1873 and 1877, the Russian police arrested 1,611 propagandists, of whom 15% were women. Radicals in the movement focused on Russia\u2019s oppressive taxation and land laws, and their propaganda was viewed as a threat by Tsar Alexander II. He ordered the arrest and trial of known Narodniks and Narodnik sympathizers in the peasantry; peasants were forced to expose the Narodniks to the authorities to escape persecution themselves.  Beginning in 1877, a long and slow [[Trial of the 193|trial of 193]] Narodniks was conducted. The propagandists had to either operate covertly or face imprisonment.<ref>Statistics on the trials of Narodniks were borrowed from Watson, Hugh. The Russian Empire, 1801-1917. Oxford: Clarendon P., 1967. 205-225.</ref> \n\nThe more the government tried to repress the Narodniks, the more radical the Narodniks became. They grew increasingly selective in their membership, and their Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) members would eventually evolve to form more terroristic organizations: [[Narodnaya Volya]] (The People\u2019s Will) and Chornyperedel (Black Repartition).<ref>See http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403562/Narodnik</ref>  These groups sought to begin a revolution through violence, and when members of Narodnaya Volya killed Tsar Alexander in 1881, the larger Narodnik movement lost virtually all support in the communes and rural parts of Russia. Government oppression further radicalized the Narodniks, and the peasants could not support enhanced radicalization of the already radical intelligentsia.\n\n==Influence==\n\n''Narodnichestvo'' had a direct influence on politics and culture in [[Romania]], through the writings of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and the advocacy of the [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Constantin Stere]] (who was a member of ''Narodnaya Volya'' in his youth). The latter helped found various groups, included one formed around the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', which he published along with [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] and Paul Bujor.\n\nStere and the ''[[Poporanism|Poporanist]]'' (from ''popor'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"people\") movement eventually rejected revolution altogether. Nevertheless, he shared the Narodnik view that capitalism was not a necessary stage in the development of an agrarian country. This perspective, which contradicted traditional Marxism, also influenced [[Ion Mihalache]]'s [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] and its successor, the [[National Peasants' Party]], as well as the philosophy of [[Virgil Madgearu]].\n\nThe Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] detected a Narodnik influence on Bolshevist method. \"Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks owe more than they have sometimes admitted to the experience and methods of work of the Buonarrotist-Narodnik tradition, though Marxist antiritualism has done its best to establish an atmosphere of deliberate and extreme matter-of-factness and colourlessness even in cloak-and-dagger activities which, as their popular name shows, tend to compensate for the extreme tension in which participants are involved by a certain amount of romanticism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hobsbawm |first=Eric |title=Primitive Rebels |location=Manchester, U.K. |publisher=University of Manchester Press |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-7190-0493-3 |page=173 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nihilist movement]]\n*[[Narodnaya Volya]]\n*[[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]\n*[[Group of Narodnik Socialists]]\n*[[Nakanune (newspaper)]]\n*[[Nikolai Danielson]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Pedler, Anne. \"Going to the People: The Russian Narodniki in 1874\u20135\".

In the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] were slowly becoming the primary theories of Russian political thought, and Mikhaylovsky, realizing this shift in thought, began to tweak his original ideas of Narodnism, such that two groups of Narodniks emerged: the so-called \"Critical Narodniks\" and \"Doctrinaire Narodniks\". Critical Narodniks followed Mikhaylovsky, and assumed a very flexible stance on capitalism, whilst adhering to their basic orientation. The more well-known Doctrinaire Narodniks had a firm belief that capitalism had no future in Russia or in any [[agrarian country]].\n\nNarodnichestvo arose after the [[emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in 1861 under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], which signaled the end of [[feudalism]] in Russia. Arguing that freed serfs were being sold into [[wage slavery]], in which the [[bourgeoisie]] had replaced [[landowner]]s, Narodnism aimed to become a political force opposed to the phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They supported the existing ''[[obshchina]]'' system of [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]s and wanted to strengthen peasant self-governance.\n\nNarodniki established semi-underground circles (\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043a\u0438) such as the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky|Chaikovsky Circle]] and [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]], with the goals of self-education and external propaganda work. They shared the common general aims of destroying the [[Russian Empire|Russian monarchy]] and of distributing land fairly among the peasantry. The Narodniks generally believed that it was possible to forgo the capitalist phase of Russia's development and proceed directly to [[socialism]].\n\nThe Narodniks saw the peasantry as the [[Working class|revolutionary class]] that would overthrow the monarchy, and perceived the village commune as the embryo of socialism.

The Bakunists believed revolution among the peasantry and populist uprisings in Russia would begin in the immediate future, the latter believed that propaganda should precede revolution, and the process would be more gradual.<ref>Pedler, Anne, The Slavonic Review, Vol. 6, No. 16 (Jun., 1927), pp. 130-141 Published by: the Modern Humanities Research Association and University College London, School of Slavonic and East European Studies</ref>  Bakunists believed that the peasants were ready to revolt with little propagandizing, whereas the Lavrists thought that considerable effort would be needed for the uprisings to begin. A lack of ideological unity resulted in varied approaches to the movement, and because of this the Narodniks no longer presented a united front to rural Russia. Some Narodniks believed in propagandizing by staying in one area for an extended period of time and assimilating into a commune that they were trying to revolutionize (\u201csettled\u201d propaganda), and others practiced propagandizing by using pamphlets and literature to maximize the number of people that the message reached (\u201cflying\u201d propaganda). \n\nDisunity was prevalent even though Narodniks only traveled in three directions: either towards [[Volga River|Volga]], [[Dnieper]], or [[Don River (Russia)|Don]].<ref name=\"Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141\">Pedler, Slavonic Review, 130-141.</ref>  The Narodniki, who often took up work as as nurses, scribes, schoolteachers, or participated in construction and harvest, struggled in unfamiliar terrain and poverty. All Narodniks resented foreign intervention into Russia, wanted Russian communes to control their own economic policies. Narodniks believed that the Tsar had impoverished the peasants, but Narodniks should have understood how highly the peasants regarded the Tsar. By failing to present a disciplined message and avoid directly attacking the Tsar, the Narodniki was often simply ignored.<ref>Siljak, Ana. The \"Girl Assassin.\" In Angel of Vengeance: The Girl Who Shot the Governor of St. Petersburg and Sparked the Age of Assassination. New York: Griffin ; 2010. 48.</ref>  It was not until the formation of Narodnaya Volya in 1879 that young revolutionaries saw the need for organization and a disciplined message.<ref>Thaden, Edward C. Russia since 1801: the making of a new society. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1971. 335-350.</ref>\n\nThis lack of unity is responsible for the third reason that the \u201cgoing to the people movement\u201d failed; the peasants did not receive the intellectuals well. The reception that the [[intelligentsia]] received in the communes was so poor that it destroyed their idealized image of the peasant that was so common prior to 1874. The Narodniks saw peasants as a unified body; they thought that all peasants dressed poorly, so intellectuals dressed as poorly as was possible in order to fit in. In actuality, the peasants saw a poorly dressed person as a person with no authority or credibility. Accordingly, intellectuals dressing as they imagined the peasant dressed had an adverse effect; it actually made peasants suspicious of the intellectuals. Furthermore, Narodnik propaganda failed to address the more mundane, ordinary concerns of the peasantry. The everyday troubles of a rural Russian\u2014a lack of material goods, poor healthcare, etc.\u2014left  little time for discussions of [[socialism]] or [[Egotism|egoism]].<ref>See Frierson, Cathy A. Peasant Icons: Representations of Rural People in Late Nineteenth Century Russia. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 68.</ref>\n\n[[Feminism]] in the Narodnik movement was also hard for the peasantry to accept. Pre-Marxist revolutionaries believed in an unusually strong [[Gender equality|equality of sex]], and educated noblewomen played major roles in radical movements in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Russian revolutionary literature in the 1840s and 1850s linked the causes of emancipation of [[serfs]] with the emancipation of the Russian woman\u2014this literature was manifest in the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks promulgated Chernyshevskyan ideas of chaste cohabitation\u2014that men and women should live together with no sexual interactions\u2014and gender equality. These concepts were extremely odd to most peasants, and they did not generally react well to them. Furthermore, Narodniks often lived in communes where non-married men and women slept and lived in the same rooms. To Orthodox Russian peasants in the 1870s, such disregard of gender norms were both offensive and off-putting. When you consider the fact that nearly 60% of Narodnik women were from wealthy classes it becomes clear why the Russian peasant could not relate to most intellectuals in the movement intellectually, economically or socially.<ref>Information on sex in the Narodnik movement was drawn from Robert H. McNeal Journal of Social History, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Winter, 1971-1972), pp. 143-163 Published by: Oxford University Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3786408</ref>  Historian Dmitri Pisarev writes that \u201csensing their inability to act alone, the intelligent radical made the peasantry the instrument to realize their hopes.\u201d As historian Daniel Field wrote, however, \u201cNarodniks found that the peasant desire for land was not accompanied by a wish to rebel.\u201d<ref>See Field, Daniel. Peasants and Propagandists in the Russian Movement to the People in 1874. London, U.K.: Garland Publishing Company, 1992. 423.</ref>  The Russian government did not look favorably on the Narodniks advocating their overthrow, and peasants would only abide Narodniks so long as no criminal connections could be drawn to them. The Narodniks believed that the peasants were the class in Russia most prone to revolution, yet the peasants were not ready for revolutionary action.<ref>See http://s4ss.org/342/remembering-nikolai-tchaikovsky-lessons-from-the-narodniks/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013351/http://s4ss.org/342/remembering-nikolai-tchaikovsky-lessons-from-the-narodniks/ |date=2014-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nGovernment suppression of the Narodniki resulted in mass trials that widely publicized the views of the Narodniki, and outraged the public. Between 1873 and 1877, the Russian police arrested 1,611 propagandists, of whom 15% were women. Radicals in the movement focused on Russia\u2019s oppressive taxation and land laws, and their propaganda was viewed as a threat by Tsar Alexander II. He ordered the arrest and trial of known Narodniks and Narodnik sympathizers in the peasantry; peasants were forced to expose the Narodniks to the authorities to escape persecution themselves.  Beginning in 1877, a long and slow [[Trial of the 193|trial of 193]] Narodniks was conducted. The propagandists had to either operate covertly or face imprisonment.<ref>Statistics on the trials of Narodniks were borrowed from Watson, Hugh. The Russian Empire, 1801-1917. Oxford: Clarendon P., 1967. 205-225.</ref> \n\nThe more the government tried to repress the Narodniks, the more radical the Narodniks became. They grew increasingly selective in their membership, and their Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) members would eventually evolve to form more terroristic organizations: [[Narodnaya Volya]] (The People\u2019s Will) and Chornyperedel (Black Repartition).<ref>See http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403562/Narodnik</ref>  These groups sought to begin a revolution through violence, and when members of Narodnaya Volya killed Tsar Alexander in 1881, the larger Narodnik movement lost virtually all support in the communes and rural parts of Russia. Government oppression further radicalized the Narodniks, and the peasants could not support enhanced radicalization of the already radical intelligentsia.\n\n==Influence==\n\n''Narodnichestvo'' had a direct influence on politics and culture in [[Romania]], through the writings of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and the advocacy of the [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Constantin Stere]] (who was a member of ''Narodnaya Volya'' in his youth). The latter helped found various groups, included one formed around the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', which he published along with [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] and Paul Bujor.\n\nStere and the ''[[Poporanism|Poporanist]]'' (from ''popor'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"people\") movement eventually rejected revolution altogether. Nevertheless, he shared the Narodnik view that capitalism was not a necessary stage in the development of an agrarian country. This perspective, which contradicted traditional Marxism, also influenced [[Ion Mihalache]]'s [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] and its successor, the [[National Peasants' Party]], as well as the philosophy of [[Virgil Madgearu]].\n\nThe Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] detected a Narodnik influence on Bolshevist method. \"Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks owe more than they have sometimes admitted to the experience and methods of work of the Buonarrotist-Narodnik tradition, though Marxist antiritualism has done its best to establish an atmosphere of deliberate and extreme matter-of-factness and colourlessness even in cloak-and-dagger activities which, as their popular name shows, tend to compensate for the extreme tension in which participants are involved by a certain amount of romanticism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hobsbawm |first=Eric |title=Primitive Rebels |location=Manchester, U.K. |publisher=University of Manchester Press |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-7190-0493-3 |page=173 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nihilist movement]]\n*[[Narodnaya Volya]]\n*[[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]\n*[[Group of Narodnik Socialists]]\n*[[Nakanune (newspaper)]]\n*[[Nikolai Danielson]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Pedler, Anne. \"Going to the People: The Russian Narodniki in 1874\u20135\".
