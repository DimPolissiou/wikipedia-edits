The previous government had the largest majority in the history of the state with a combined 113 seats out of the 166-seat [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. The aftermath of the general election resulted in months of negotiations for an agreement of government. A deal was reached with the main opposition and traditional rival Fianna F\u00e1il to facilitate a minority [[Government of the 32nd D\u00e1il|Fine Gael-led government]]. Fine Gael now governs [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] alone with eight [[Independent politicians|Independent]] members of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]].\n\n==Planning and payment tribunals==\nThe [[Moriarty Tribunal]] has sat since 1997 and has investigated the granting of a mobile phone license to [[Esat Telecom]] by [[Michael Lowry]] when he was Fine Gael [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications]] in the Rainbow Coalition of the mid-1990s. Lowry resigned from the Cabinet after it was revealed at the Moriarty Tribunal that businessman [[Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)|Ben Dunne]] had paid for an IR\u00a3395,000 extension to Lowry's [[County Tipperary]] home. Lowry, now an independent [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], supported the [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]\u2013[[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] government in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] until March 2011.\n\nIt was also revealed in December 1996 that Fine Gael had received some \u00a3180,000 from [[Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)|Ben Dunne]] in the period 1987 to 1993. This was composed of \u00a3100,000 in 1993, \u00a350,000 in 1992 and \u00a330,000 in 1989. In addition, Michael Noonan received \u00a33,000 in 1992 towards his election campaign, [[Ivan Yates]] received \u00a35,000, [[Michael Lowry]] received \u00a35,000 and Sean Barrett received \u00a31,000 in the earlier 1987 election. John Bruton said he had received \u00a31,000 from Dunne in 1982 towards his election campaign, and Dunne had also given \u00a315,000 to the Labour Party during the 1990 Presidential election campaign.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1996/1205/Pg001.html|title=Irish Times article|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\nFollowing revelations at the [[Moriarty Tribunal]] on 16 February 1999, in relation to [[Charles Haughey]] and his relationship with [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB]], former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald confirmed that [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB]] and Ansbacher wrote off debts of almost \u00a3200,000 that he owed in 1993, when he was in financial difficulties because of the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, GPA, in which he was a shareholder.

It is located to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting it to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston]] and [[Montreal]], among other destinations. Ottawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. \n\nIt was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa Station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa Station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967. In 2000, the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] named the station as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium.<ref name=\"RAIC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|title=Cultural consequence|last=Cook|first=Maria|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Canwest|date=11 May 2000|accessdate=11 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090211/http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|archivedate=30 May 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Union Station Ottawa a034379.jpg|thumb|Ottawa's former Union Station in the 1920's]]\nOttawa's trains once came into the large downtown [[Senate of Canada Building|Union Station]] (active 1912-1966), a short distance from the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament buildings]] and south of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Laurier]] Hotel. However, in 1966 the railway tracks beside the [[Rideau Canal]] were replaced by the [[National Capital Commission]]\u2019s [[Colonel By Drive]] scenic parkway as part of an [[Greber Plan|urban renewal plan]]. Initially the former station was converted into a [[Government Conference Centre]] before becoming a new temporary home for the [[Senate of Canada]] (2019- ), as extensive renovations are conducted on their former location in the [[Centre Block]] building on [[Parliament Hill]].\n\nPer a sign located inside the station: <blockquote>\"The Ottawa Station was completed in 1966 as part of a plan for the relocation and consolidation of many railway lines built between 1854 and 1916.

It is located to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting it to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston]] and [[Montreal]], among other destinations. Ottawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. \n\nIt was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa Station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa Station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967. In 2000, the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] named the station as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium.<ref name=\"RAIC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|title=Cultural consequence|last=Cook|first=Maria|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Canwest|date=11 May 2000|accessdate=11 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090211/http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|archivedate=30 May 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Union Station Ottawa a034379.jpg|thumb|Ottawa's former Union Station in the 1920's]]\nOttawa's trains once came into the large downtown [[Senate of Canada Building|Union Station]] (active 1912-1966), a short distance from the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament buildings]] and south of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Laurier]] Hotel.

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011</ref> \"by the early 5th cent. the word had become a technical term in Christian asceticism, signifying a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray.\" Not only monks and theologians spoke of the vice but it appears in the writings of laymen as well.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire  troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. /  Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of  Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>.</blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/212847707|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>.\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an \"indolence of the heart\" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H.

A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011</ref> \"by the early 5th cent. the word had become a technical term in Christian asceticism, signifying a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray.\" Not only monks and theologians spoke of the vice but it appears in the writings of laymen as well. It appears in Dante's Divine Comedy not only as a sin to be punished in the damned but as the sin that leads Dante to the edge of Hell to begin with<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.westmont.edu/bstrine/styleable/essay/infernoacedia.html|title=The Inferno: Dante's Sin of Acedia|website=homepage.westmont.edu|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>. [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire  troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. /  Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of  Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>.</blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/212847707|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>.\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an \"indolence of the heart\" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708</ref>\n* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.\n*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called \"Accidie\". A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".
