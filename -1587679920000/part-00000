Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao are autonomous, self-governing [[Constituent state|constituent countries]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], while Bonaire is a [[Caribbean Netherlands|special municipality]] of the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the disputed letters of [[Amerigo Vespucci]], the ABC islands were first explored by one of [[Christopher Columbus]]' captains, [[Alonso de Ojeda]], who landed on Cura\u00e7ao in 1499.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Entdecker und Eroberer Amerikas ; von Christoph Kolumbus bis Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|last=Konetzke|first=Richard|publisher=Fischer B\u00fccherei|year=1963|isbn=|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages= 54\u201355}}</ref> He is said to have called the islands ''Las islas de los Gigantes'' or ''Islands of the Giants'' due to the native inhabitants, the [[Caquetio people|Caiquetio Indians]]. The first known European exploration was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]], whose cartographer [[Juan de la Cosa]] first described the islands. By 1527 the Spanish had formed a government and established [[Catholicism]] on the islands.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Netherlands]] fought Spain over control of the islands. The Dutch won, (although Spain won them back before abandoning them due to them being of little value) and the islands were then administered by the Netherlands. The [[Dutch West India Company]] developed the areas, establishing a major port on Cura\u00e7ao. The abolition of the slave trade in 1863 had a devastating impact on their economies, although the economy revived when oil was discovered in [[Venezuela]] during the early 20th century, and the islands became major oil refineries.\n\nFrom 1815 until 1954 the three islands were known as the [[Colony of Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies]]. This colony at various times also included [[Netherlands Suriname]] and [[Sint Eustatius and Dependencies]]. In 1954, the ABC islands became part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], which gave them political autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1986 Aruba withdrew from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate country within the kingdom.<ref name=\"Adventure Guide\">{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Lynne M.|title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire & Cura\u00e7ao|publisher=Hunter Publishing|location=[[Edison, New Jersey]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58843-572-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC|accessdate=2014-06-17}}</ref> Upon the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] on 10 October 2010, Cura\u00e7ao gained a similar status to Aruba. Bonaire became a special municipality of the Netherlands proper, although it maintains its status of an [[Overseas countries and territories|overseas territory]] of the [[European Union]].\n\n== Geography and climate==\n{{see also|Geography of Aruba}}\n[[File:Flag of Aruba.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Aruba]] ]]\n[[File:Flag of Bonaire.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Bonaire]] ]]\n[[File:Flag of Cura\u00e7ao.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Cura\u00e7ao]] ]]\nThe ABC islands are part of the [[Leeward Antilles]], which is the westernmost area of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. They lie immediately to the north of [[Falc\u00f3n State]], [[Venezuela]]. Due to their political history, they are sometimes considered to be part of [[North America]] along with the other Caribbean islands, although they lie on [[South America]]\u2019s geographical plate; the same phenomenon happens with [[Trinidad and Tobago]].\n\nABC does not indicate the geographical order to each other; from west to east the islands are Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire. Aruba is a flat island, exposed to the ocean currents. Bonaire and Cura\u00e7\u00e3o are surrounded by reefs, and so are much more sheltered from the weather. Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s reefs are popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe ABC Islands have an atypical hot desert climate (in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'' and ''BWk''), in which there is an excess of [[evaporation]] over [[precipitation]]. Surfaces on these islands hold little moisture and evaporate the little rainfall they receive. In addition, [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]] is the most common vegetation on these islands. Furthermore, ABC islands are very dry as they lie north of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] but except in their short rainy season from October to December or January are not exposed to moisture from the northeast [[trade winds]]. The rainy season is powerfully influenced by the [[Southern Oscillation]] resulting in very high variability.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; \u2018Geographical patterning in interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach\u2019; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457\u20133466</ref> During strong [[El Ni\u00f1o]] years like 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 annual (fiscal year) rainfall can be less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, and even under {{convert|100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} at Cura\u00e7\u00e3o in 1911/1912. In contrast, as much as {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} may fall during a strong [[La Ni\u00f1a]] year like 1933/1934, 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000 or 2010/2011, with the highest monthly totals being over {{convert|350|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.\n\nTemperatures in the ABC Islands are uniformly hot, averaging around {{convert|28|to|37|C|F|1}} year-round, with comfortable humidity and minima rarely falling below {{convert|25|C|F|disp=or}} even on the mildest mornings, although afternoons rarely top {{convert|40|C|F|disp=or}}.\n\n=== Environment ===\nBonaire is known for being a \"diving paradise\", with ecotourism playing a large part in its economy. The islands have a huge variety of wildlife, including [[flamingo]]es and four species of [[sea turtle]].<ref name=\"Adventure Guide\"/>\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[Afro-Caribbean]] people make up a large proportion of Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire's population and Europeans make up for the majority of Aruba's population. There has been substantial immigration from [[North America]] and [[Europe]] to the islands and to a lesser extent from [[South America]].\n\n=== Language ===\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has been the official language of the islands for most of their history. A unique [[Creole language|Portuguese creole]] language has developed there known as [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.narin.com/papiamentu/|title=Papiamentu is the local language of the ABC Islands \u2013 Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao|first=Attila|last=Narin|work=narin.com|date=29 September 2003|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref> Unlike other creole languages, Papiamentu is not decreasing in usage, and was made an official language on 7 March 2007.<ref name=\"Aruba Language\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arubavisit.info/aruba-language/|title=Aruba Language|work=arubavisit.info|accessdate=9 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628062013/http://www.arubavisit.info/aruba-language/|archivedate=28 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Papiamentu is heavily influenced by [[English language|English]], [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref name=\"Aruba Language\"/>\n\n== Politics ==\nAruba and Cura\u00e7ao are autonomous countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which have their own parliament and prime minister.

Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao are autonomous, self-governing [[Constituent state|constituent countries]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], while Bonaire is a [[Caribbean Netherlands|special municipality]] of the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the disputed letters of [[Amerigo Vespucci]], the ABC islands were first explored by one of [[Christopher Columbus]]' captains, [[Alonso de Ojeda]], who landed on Cura\u00e7ao in 1499.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Entdecker und Eroberer Amerikas ; von Christoph Kolumbus bis Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|last=Konetzke|first=Richard|publisher=Fischer B\u00fccherei|year=1963|isbn=|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages= 54\u201355}}</ref> He is said to have called the islands ''Las islas de los Gigantes'' or ''Islands of the Giants'' due to the native inhabitants, the [[Caquetio people|Caiquetio Indians]]. The first known European exploration was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]], whose cartographer [[Juan de la Cosa]] first described the islands. By 1527 the Spanish had formed a government and established [[Catholicism]] on the islands.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Netherlands]] fought Spain over control of the islands. The Dutch won, (although Spain won them back before abandoning them due to them being of little value) and the islands were then administered by the Netherlands. The [[Dutch West India Company]] developed the areas, establishing a major port on Cura\u00e7ao. The abolition of the slave trade in 1863 had a devastating impact on their economies, although the economy revived when oil was discovered in [[Venezuela]] during the early 20th century, and the islands became major oil refineries.\n\nFrom 1815 until 1954 the three islands were known as the [[Colony of Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies]]. This colony at various times also included [[Netherlands Suriname]] and [[Sint Eustatius and Dependencies]]. In 1954, the ABC islands became part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], which gave them political autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1986 Aruba withdrew from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate country within the kingdom.<ref name=\"Adventure Guide\">{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Lynne M.|title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire & Cura\u00e7ao|publisher=Hunter Publishing|location=[[Edison, New Jersey]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58843-572-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC|accessdate=2014-06-17}}</ref> Upon the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] on 10 October 2010, Cura\u00e7ao gained a similar status to Aruba. Bonaire became a special municipality of the Netherlands proper, although it maintains its status of an [[Overseas countries and territories|overseas territory]] of the [[European Union]].\n\n== Geography and climate==\n{{see also|Geography of Aruba}}\n[[File:Flag of Aruba.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Aruba]] ]]\n[[File:Flag of Bonaire.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Bonaire]] ]]\n[[File:Flag of Cura\u00e7ao.svg|thumb|150px|[[Flag of Cura\u00e7ao]] ]]\nThe ABC islands are part of the [[Leeward Antilles]], which is the westernmost area of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. They lie immediately to the north of [[Falc\u00f3n State]], [[Venezuela]]. Due to their political history, they are sometimes considered to be part of [[North America]] along with the other Caribbean islands, although they lie on [[South America]]\u2019s geographical plate; the same phenomenon happens with [[Trinidad and Tobago]].\n\nABC does not indicate the geographical order to each other; from west to east the islands are Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire. Aruba is a flat island, exposed to the ocean currents. Bonaire and Cura\u00e7\u00e3o are surrounded by reefs, and so are much more sheltered from the weather. Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s reefs are popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe ABC Islands have an atypical hot desert climate (in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'' and ''BWk''), in which there is an excess of [[evaporation]] over [[precipitation]]. Surfaces on these islands hold little moisture and evaporate the little rainfall they receive. In addition, [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]] is the most common vegetation on these islands. Furthermore, ABC islands are very dry as they lie north of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] but except in their short rainy season from October to December or January are not exposed to moisture from the northeast [[trade winds]]. The rainy season is powerfully influenced by the [[Southern Oscillation]] resulting in very high variability.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; \u2018Geographical patterning in interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach\u2019; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457\u20133466</ref> During strong [[El Ni\u00f1o]] years like 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 annual (fiscal year) rainfall can be less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, and even under {{convert|100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} at Cura\u00e7\u00e3o in 1911/1912. In contrast, as much as {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} may fall during a strong [[La Ni\u00f1a]] year like 1933/1934, 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000 or 2010/2011, with the highest monthly totals being over {{convert|350|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.\n\nTemperatures in the ABC Islands are uniformly hot, averaging around {{convert|28|to|37|C|F|1}} year-round, with comfortable humidity and minima rarely falling below {{convert|25|C|F|disp=or}} even on the mildest mornings, although afternoons rarely top {{convert|40|C|F|disp=or}}.\n\n=== Environment ===\nBonaire is known for being a \"diving paradise\", with ecotourism playing a large part in its economy. The islands have a huge variety of wildlife, including [[flamingo]]es and four species of [[sea turtle]].<ref name=\"Adventure Guide\"/>\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[Afro-Caribbean]] people make up a large proportion of Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire's population and [[Europeans]] make up for the majority of Aruba's population. There has been substantial immigration from [[North America]] and [[Europe]] to the islands and to a lesser extent from [[South America]].\n\n=== Language ===\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has been the official language of the islands for most of their history. A unique [[Creole language|Portuguese creole]] language has developed there known as [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.narin.com/papiamentu/|title=Papiamentu is the local language of the ABC Islands \u2013 Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao|first=Attila|last=Narin|work=narin.com|date=29 September 2003|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref> Unlike other creole languages, Papiamentu is not decreasing in usage, and was made an official language on 7 March 2007.<ref name=\"Aruba Language\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arubavisit.info/aruba-language/|title=Aruba Language|work=arubavisit.info|accessdate=9 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628062013/http://www.arubavisit.info/aruba-language/|archivedate=28 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Papiamentu is heavily influenced by [[English language|English]], [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref name=\"Aruba Language\"/>\n\n== Politics ==\nAruba and Cura\u00e7ao are autonomous countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which have their own parliament and prime minister.

Crosman]].\n\nCrosman was born the year the Civil War started and moved all over the US from post to post with her army father, and so was educated in many places. On leaving school she decided to become an actress.\n\nWhen she was 16, Crosman spent a year in Paris studying music with thoughts of singing grand opera. After her voice broke during a vocal lesson, she left France and thereafter turned her thoughts toward a career in theater.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite journal |last1=Farmer |first1=Frank J. |title=Broadway's Latest Theatrical Sensation |journal=Broadway Magazine |date=December 1900 |volume=VI |issue=3 |pages=162-163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8VTvexpGpgC&pg=PA162&dq=%22Henrietta+Crosman%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL5_Xq1t_fAhURKKwKHXP3DmAQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&q=%22Henrietta%20Crosman%22&f=false |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical career==\nCrosman got her start in 1883 at the old Windsor Theatre, New York with the assistance of the long-time theatre manager [[John A.

Her debut role was as Lilly in [[Bartley Campbell]]'s ''The White Slave''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7kaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT283&dq= ''The Burr McIntosh Monthly 1905]; accessed May, 25, 2013.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iG8uAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&dq= ''The Players Blue Book'', 1901, p. 86]; accessed May 25, 2013.</ref>\n\nShe later toured the country with [[Robert L. Downing]] in classic parts. In 1889 she appeared in her first Shakespeare play, ''[[As You Like It]]'', at [[Augustin Daly]]'s theater. During the course of the early 1890s she was managed by [[Daniel Frohman]] and appeared in his [[repertory theatre|stock company]]. From 1892 to 1894 her career was managed by Daniel's brother, [[Charles Frohman]]. For a short period during 1891, and in between Frohman brothers, she was under the aegis of [[Albert Marshman Palmer|A. M. Palmer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crosman as Nell Gwynn.jpg|left|thumb|Crosman as Nell in ''Mistress Nell'' (circa 1901)]]\nBy 1900 Crosman was a star and appeared for the first time as such in ''[[George Cochrane Hazelton (actor)|Mistress Nell]]'' keeping in line with the sort of costume adventures that were becoming her forte. In 1902, she appeared in the productions of \"Joan of the Shoals\", \"As You Like It\" and \"The Sword of the King\". In 1903, she premiered another exceptional play, \"Sweet Kitty Bellairs\". Several of these plays would be made as films in the silent era played by younger actresses.\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crosman in \"The Sword and the King\".png|upright|thumb|Henrietta Crosman in ''The Sword and the King'' (1902)]]\nIn 1911, she and her company staged 60 performances of [[Catherine Chisholm Cushing]]'s comedy ''The Real Thing'' at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]] in New York, before taking the show on the road. In early July 1912, Crosman and company were in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] following the [[Regina Cyclone]], and staged a benefit performance of ''The Real Thing'' for the victims.<ref>http://www.morethanamonster.com/downloads/Karloff-in-Saskatchewan.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crossman 02.JPG|left|upright|thumb|''Munsey's Magazine'', 1910]] \nNow in her forties, Crosman was starting to move away from the strenuous sword-carrying, heavy costume adventures that she was popular in. Much of the remainder of her theatrical career would consist of drawing room comedies and farces, a type of playing that was less hectic for an ageing actress. However, she would return to revivals of Shakespeare, i.e. ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', and in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Rivals''.<ref>''Who Was Who In the Theatre: 1912-1976'', originally by John Parker, culled from many of his editions published annually (Crosman, Henrietta profile; p. 564)<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Charlie Chan's Secret (1936) - Henrietta Crosman.jpg|right|thumb|Crosman in ''[[Charlie Chan's Secret]]'' (1936)]]\nCrosman, like many a heralded stage star, held off from motion pictures. But by 1914 and possibly out of curiosity she 'signed up', as the popular motto went at the time, for a one-picture deal with [[Adolph Zukor]]'s [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players]]. It was a film version of ''The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch'',<ref>''Pictorial History of the Silent Film'' by Daniel Blum c. 1953, p. 54<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> which as a play had been a winning success for [[Minnie Maddern Fiske|Mrs Fiske]] in 1901 on Broadway. ''The Supreme Test'' followed in 1915 for [[Universal Studios]] but afterwards her silent film appearances were sporadic. Her husband Maurice Campbell joined his wife in the movie industry eventually becoming a noted director.\n\nBy 1930 [[silent film]]s had given way to [[talkies|talking pictures]] and as in 1914 the motion picture business courted stage trained actors. Crosman a veteran and now approaching seventy had a career resurgence endearing herself to a new younger generation who never had the chance to see her in her youth on stage. She gave a heartbreaking performance in a rare lead film role in ''[[Pilgrimage (1933 film)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1933) as the embittered mother of a soldier killed in World War I who travels to the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] and undergoes a spiritual renewal. An earlier talkie in which she appeared was ''[[The Royal Family of Broadway]]'' (1930), a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] version of the [[The Royal Family (play)|play]] by [[Edna Ferber]], loosely based on the [[Barrymore family]]. \n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1886, Crosman married Sedley Browne. A year later, they had a son, Sedley Browne Jr. The Brownes divorced in 1896, after which their son changed his name to George Crosman. Later in 1896, she married newspaperman Maurice Campbell, who later became a stage producer and a director of silent films.

Crosman]].\n\nCrosman was born the year the Civil War started and moved all over the US from post to post with her army father, and so was educated in many places. On leaving school she decided to become an actress.\n\nWhen she was 16, Crosman spent a year in Paris studying music with thoughts of singing grand opera. After her voice broke during a vocal lesson, she left France and thereafter turned her thoughts toward a career in theater.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite journal |last1=Farmer |first1=Frank J. |title=Broadway's Latest Theatrical Sensation |journal=Broadway Magazine |date=December 1900 |volume=VI |issue=3 |pages=162-163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8VTvexpGpgC&pg=PA162&dq=%22Henrietta+Crosman%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL5_Xq1t_fAhURKKwKHXP3DmAQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&q=%22Henrietta%20Crosman%22&f=false |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical career==\nCrosman got her start in 1883 at the old Windsor Theatre, New York with the assistance of the long-time theatre manager [[John A. Ellsler]]. Her debut role was as Lilly in [[Bartley Campbell]]'s ''The White Slave''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7kaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT283&dq= ''The Burr McIntosh Monthly 1905]; accessed MAy, 25, 2013.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iG8uAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&dq= ''The Players Blue Book'', 1901, p. 86]; accessed May 25, 2013.</ref>\n\nShe later toured the country with [[Robert L. Downing]] in classic parts. In 1889 she appeared in her first Shakespeare play, ''[[As You Like It]]'', at [[Augustin Daly]]'s theater. During the course of the early 1890s she was managed by [[Daniel Frohman]] and appeared in his [[repertory theatre|stock company]]. From 1892 to 1894 her career was managed by Daniel's brother, [[Charles Frohman]]. For a short period during 1891, and in between Frohman brothers, she was under the aegis of [[Albert Marshman Palmer|A. M. Palmer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crosman as Nell Gwynn.jpg|left|thumb|Crosman as Nell in ''Mistress Nell'' (circa 1901)]]\nBy 1900 Crosman was a star and appeared for the first time as such in ''[[George Cochrane Hazelton (actor)|Mistress Nell]]'' keeping in line with the sort of costume adventures that were becoming her forte. In 1902, she appeared in the productions of \"Joan of the Shoals\", \"As You Like It\" and \"The Sword of the King\". In 1903, she premiered another exceptional play, \"Sweet Kitty Bellairs\". Several of these plays would be made as films in the silent era played by younger actresses.\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crosman in \"The Sword and the King\".png|upright|thumb|Henrietta Crosman in ''The Sword and the King'' (1902)]]\nIn 1911, she and her company staged 60 performances of [[Catherine Chisholm Cushing]]'s comedy ''The Real Thing'' at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]] in New York, before taking the show on the road. In early July 1912, Crosman and company were in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] following the [[Regina Cyclone]], and staged a benefit performance of ''The Real Thing'' for the victims.<ref>http://www.morethanamonster.com/downloads/Karloff-in-Saskatchewan.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:Henrietta Crossman 02.JPG|left|upright|thumb|''Munsey's Magazine'', 1910]] \nNow in her forties, Crosman was starting to move away from the strenuous sword-carrying, heavy costume adventures that she was popular in. Much of the remainder of her theatrical career would consist of drawing room comedies and farces, a type of playing that was less hectic for an ageing actress. However, she would return to revivals of Shakespeare, i.e. ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', and in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Rivals''.<ref>''Who Was Who In the Theatre: 1912-1976'', originally by John Parker, culled from many of his editions published annually (Crosman, Henrietta profile; p. 564)<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Charlie Chan's Secret (1936) - Henrietta Crosman.jpg|right|thumb|Crosman in ''[[Charlie Chan's Secret]]'' (1936)]]\nCrosman, like many a heralded stage star, held off from motion pictures. But by 1914 and possibly out of curiosity she 'signed up', as the popular motto went at the time, for a one-picture deal with [[Adolph Zukor]]'s [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players]]. It was a film version of ''The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch'',<ref>''Pictorial History of the Silent Film'' by Daniel Blum c. 1953, p. 54<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> which as a play had been a winning success for [[Minnie Maddern Fiske|Mrs Fiske]] in 1901 on Broadway. ''The Supreme Test'' followed in 1915 for [[Universal Studios]] but afterwards her silent film appearances were sporadic. Her husband Maurice Campbell joined his wife in the movie industry eventually becoming a noted director.\n\nBy 1930 [[silent film]]s had given way to [[talkies|talking pictures]] and as in 1914 the motion picture business courted stage trained actors. Crosman a veteran and now approaching seventy had a career resurgence endearing herself to a new younger generation who never had the chance to see her in her youth on stage. She gave a heartbreaking performance in a rare lead film role in ''[[Pilgrimage (1933 film)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1933) as the embittered mother of a soldier killed in World War I who travels to the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] and undergoes a spiritual renewal. An earlier talkie in which she appeared was ''[[The Royal Family of Broadway]]'' (1930), a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] version of the [[The Royal Family (play)|play]] by [[Edna Ferber]], loosely based on the [[Barrymore family]]. \n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1886, Crosman married Sedley Browne. A year later, they had a son, Sedley Browne Jr. The Brownes divorced in 1896, after which their son changed his name to George Crosman. Later in 1896, she married newspaperman Maurice Campbell, who later became a stage producer and a director of silent films. They had a son, Maurice Campbell Jr.<ref name=\"mmom\">{{cite book |last1=Nissen |first1=Axel |title=Mothers, Mammies and Old Maids: Twenty-Five Character Actresses of Golden Age Hollywood |date=2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786490455 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXqFB-YFYpYC&pg=PA35&dq=%22Henrietta+Crosman%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL5_Xq1t_fAhURKKwKHXP3DmAQ6AEIQzAE#v=onepage&q=%22Henrietta%20Crosman%22&f=false |accessdate=9 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Crosman married and had two sons.
