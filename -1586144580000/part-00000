The [[visible spectrum]] is about 390 to 700 [[Nanometer|nm]] and the atlas covers from 361.2 to 877.1&nbsp;nm (plus an appendix) so that the atlas has some coverage of the [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] spectrum of sunlight. The atlas, compiled by Minnaert and his students Mulders and Houtgast, was published in 1940 shortly before the WWII invasion of the Netherlands.<ref name=MinnaertRef/>\n\n{{blockquote|The ''Atlas'' contains intensity curves covering the complete solar spectrum from \u03bb 3612 to \u03bb 8771 based on photographs taken at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] together with an appendix covering the region \u03bb 3332 to \u03bb 3637 as derived from plates secured at [[Utrecht]]. The scale in wave length is about 20 millimeters per [[angstrom]] so that the spectrum is represented on a map about 360 feet long. The curves are printed in black on millimeter paper with blue lines. The intensity scale is such that a vertical range of 100 millimeters corresponds to the difference between zero intensity and the continuous background.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reviewed Work: ''Photometric Atlas of the Solar Spectrum'' by M.

Full understanding of the significance of [[Fraunhofer lines]] required a huge amount of pioneering research in astrophysics and quantum theory. [[Cecilia Payne]] (1925) demonstrated that variations in stellar line strengths can be explained by the [[Saha ionization equation]]. Payne's work lead to a major study of the chemical abundances in the solar atmosphere undertaken by [[Henry Norris Russell|H. N. Russell]], [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter S.

Around 1930, the procedures developed by Russell, Adams, and Moore were adapted by Minnaert and Mulders for determining chemical abundances in stellar [[photosphere]]s.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Lorenzano, P.|editor2=Rheinberger, H.-J.|editor3=Ortiz, E.|editor4=Delfino Galles, C.|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|volume=vol.

He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> He worked as an animator and writer for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' series.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|Larry & Steve]]'', which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an \"old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another\".

He found it easier to develop his own style at ''Johnny Bravo'' through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''Cow and Chicken'', and ''I Am Weasel'' did not use.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> As a part of the ''Johnny Bravo'' crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as [[Adam West]] and [[Jack Sheldon]] of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ''Family Guy'' series.\n\nHe also did freelance work for [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], writing for ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', and for [[Nelvana]], where he wrote for ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ''Ace Ventura'').<ref name=\"ignint\" /> MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ''Zoomates'' for [[Frederator Studios]]' ''[[Oh Yeah!
