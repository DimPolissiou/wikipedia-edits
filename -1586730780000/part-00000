Queen Insurance Company''''' is a [[Canadian constitutional law]] decision dealing with the taxation and licensing powers of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] under the [[Canadian federalism|federal-provincial division of powers]].\n\nThe case concerned a Quebec statute which imposed a licence fee on insurance companies.  The issue was whether the fee exceeded provincial authority under the ''British North America Act, 1867'' (now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''). The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, at that time the [[court of last resort]] for [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]], held that the statute was unconstitutional.\n\nThis was the first case where the Judicial Committee considered the scope of provincial taxation powers and licensing powers under the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  It was also the first case where the Judicial Committee held that a provincial statute was unconstitutional under the division of powers.\n\n== Facts ==\n\nIn 1875, the [[Quebec Legislature|Legislature of Quebec]] enacted a statute which required every insurance company carrying on business in Quebec to take out a licence.<ref>''An Act to compel Assurers to take out a License'',  SQ 1867 (39 Vict.), c. 7.</ref>  The licence fee was calculated as a percentage of the amounts insured by the insurance policies the company issued.  The insurance company was to pay the fee by means of stamps purchased from the provincial government, which the insurance company was to attach to each insurance policy it issued.  An insurance company which did not attach the necessary stamps to a policy was subject to a fine of $50 for each failure to do so.<ref>''An Act to compel Assurers to take out a License'', ss. 1, 2, and 5.</ref>\n\nThe Queen Insurance Company was an insurance company doing business in Montreal.  It did not take out the licence required by the provincial legislation, and issued three insurance policies without paying the licensing fee.  The Attorney General for Quebec brought an action in the [[Superior Court of Quebec]] to recover the $50 penalty for each policy, for a total of $150.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company'' (1878), 3 AC 1090, at 1092-1093, [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/116/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 117], at pp. 120-121.</ref>\n\n== Decisions of the Quebec Courts ==\n===Decision of the Superior Court===\n\nAt trial, the insurance company challenged the constitutional validity of the licence fee.  It argued that the legislation exceeded the provincial taxing power set out in section 92(2) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly the ''British North America Act, 1867''), as well as the provincial licensing power set out in s. 92(9).<ref>''[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/section-92.html#h-19 Constitution Act, 1867]'', 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3. (UK); RSC 1985, App. II, No. 11, s. 92.</ref>\n\nThe insurance company also argued that the provincial law conflicted with a federal act regulating insurance companies.  The company had complied with the federal legislation regulating insurance companies, and had paid a federal licensing charge of $150,000 under the federal law.<ref>''An Act respecting Insurance Companies'', SC 1868, c. 48.</ref>  It argued that the licence under the federal statute gave it the right to carry on the business of insurance, without paying a provincial licensing charge.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), p. 1093 (AC), p. 121 (Cart).</ref>\n\nThe insurance company was successful in the Superior Court.  Justice Torrance held that the law was an indirect tax and therefore not authorised by s. 92(2) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  Relying in part on American federalism precedents, he also held that the licensing provisions intruded on federal jurisdiction.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec pro Domina Regina v. Queen Insurance Co.'' (1877), [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/152/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 153], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_90128/page/n95/mode/2up 21 LC Jurist 77] (QC SC).</ref>\n\nThe Attorney General was represented at trial by [[Edward Carter (politician)|Edward Carter, QC, MP]] and [[Alexandre Lacoste|Alexander Lacoste, QC]].  The Queen Insurance Company was represented by [[John Abbott]], QC (future Prime Minister of Canada), and [[Joseph Doutre]], QC.\n\n===Decision of the Court of Queen's Bench===\n[[File:AntoineAimeDorion23.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion|Chief Justice Dorion]], one of the judges who held the Act was unconstitutional]]\n\nThe Attorney General appealed to the highest court in Quebec, the [[Quebec Court of Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)]].  By a 4-1 decision, the Queen's Bench agreed with the decision of the Superior Court and dismissed the appeal.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v. Queen Insurance Co.'' (1877), [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/130/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 131], 16 C.L.J. 198, [https://archive.org/details/cihm_90129/page/n337/mode/2up 22 LC Jurist 307] (QC QB).</ref>\n\nAll of the judges agreed that the stamp fee was an indirect tax, and therefore could not be supported under the provincial taxation power, given by s. 92(2) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 133, 138, 151 (Cart).</ref>\n\nHowever, they disagreed on whether the stamp duty could be upheld as a licence fee.  Four of the judges ([[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion|Chief Justice Dorion]] and Justices Taschereau, Monk and Tessier) agreed that the duty was not truly a licence fee, but simply a way to impose an indirect tax that was not within provincial authority under s. 92(9). The licence fee was therefore unconstitutional.\n<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 147, 151, and 153 (Cart)</ref> In dissent, Justice Ramsay would have held that the fee was a valid licence fee and therefore the statute could have been upheld on that basis.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at p. 135 (Cart).</ref>\n\nJustice Taschereau was the only one to address the issue of federal jurisdiction.  As part of his analysis of the provincial power to issue licence fees under s. 92(9), he held that insurance companies were subject to federal regulation under the federal jurisdiction over trade and commerce.<ref>''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 91(2).</ref> and therefore the province could not impose an additional licence on insurance companies doing business in the province.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 147-148 (Cart).</ref>\n\n== Decision of the Judicial Committee ==\n\n[[File:Sir George Jessel.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Master of the Rolls]], who wrote the decision that the Act was unconstitutional]]\n\nThe Attorney General for Quebec then appealed the case to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, the [[court of last resort]] for [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]].  (At that time, appeals could go to the Judicial Committee directly from the provincial courts, bypassing the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].)  [[Judah P. Benjamin|Judah P. Benjamin, QC]] and [[John Rigby (politician)|John Rigby]] were counsel for the Attorney General, while the insurance company was represented by Mr Kay, QC and R.W. Gibbs.\n\nThe Judicial Committee dismissed the appeal from the bench, without calling on counsel for the insurance company.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 1096 (AC), p. 1 (UKPC), p. 125 (Cart).</ref>   [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessell]], [[Master of the Rolls]], gave the decision for the Committee. He agreed with the Quebec courts that the province did not have the power to impose the fee.  Reviewing the Act, he concluded that it was not really a licensing act at all, as there was no penalty for not taking out a licence, and no prohibition on carrying on business without a licence. The policies issued by an unlicensed insurance company were valid, provided they had a stamp on them.  He concluded that the only purpose of the Act was to raise a revenue.  The province therefore could not rely on s. 92(9) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' in support of the Act.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 1099 (AC), p. 4 (UKPC), p. 129 (Cart).</ref>\n\nThe sole question was whether the fee under the Act was direct or indirect taxation.  Jessel concluded that there was ample authority to conclude that a stamp fee of this type was a form of indirect taxation.  It was therefore beyond the provincial power to enact, and the Act was unconstitutional.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at pp. 1101-1102 (AC), pp. 5-6 (UKPC), pp. 129-131 (Cart).</ref>\n\nSince the case could be decided on the basis that the Act exceeded provincial jurisdiction, the Committee did not need to consider the interplay between provincial powers under s. 92 and federal powers under s. 91 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 10967 (AC), p. 2 (UKPC), pp. 125-126 (Cart).</ref>\n\n== Significance of the decision ==\n\nThis was the first case where the Judicial Committee considered the scope of provincial taxation powers under s. 92(2), and provincial licensing powers under s. 92(9).  It was also the first case where the Judicial Committee held that a provincial statute was unconstitutional under the division of powers.\n\nThe decision has been regularly cited approvingly by the courts since it was made.  The most recent reference to it in the Supreme Court of Canada was in ''Ontario Home Builders' Assn. v. York Region Board of Education''.<ref>''Ontario Home Builders' Assn. v. York Region Board of Education'', [1996] 2 S.C.R. 929.</ref>  Academic commentators have also referred to the decision.<ref>[[G\u00e9rard La Forest|G.V. La Forest]], ''The Allocation of Taxing Power under the Canadian Constitution''.</ref>\n\nThe federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.<ref>Richard A. Olmsted, Q.C. (ed.), ''Decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relating to the British North America Act, 1867 and the Canadian Constitution, 1867-1954'', vol.

Queen Insurance Company''''' is a [[Canadian constitutional law]] decision dealing with the taxation and licensing powers of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] under the [[Canadian federalism|federal-provincial division of powers]].\n\nThe case concerned a Quebec statute which imposed a licence fee on insurance companies.  The issue was whether the fee exceeded provincial authority under the ''British North America Act, 1867'' (now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''). The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, at that time the [[court of last resort]] for [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]], held that the statute was unconstitutional.\n\nThis was the first case where the Judicial Committee considered the scope of provincial taxation powers and licensing powers under the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  It was also the first case where the Judicial Committee held that a provincial statute was unconstitutional under the division of powers.\n\n== Facts ==\n\nIn 1875, the [[Quebec Legislature|Legislature of Quebec]] enacted a statute which required every insurance company carrying on business in Quebec to take out a licence.<ref>''An Act to compel Assurers to take out a License'',  SQ 1867 (39 Vict.), c. 7.</ref>  The licence fee was calculated as a percentage of the amounts insured by the insurance policies the company issued.  The insurance company was to pay the fee by means of stamps purchased from the provincial government, which the insurance company was to attach to each insurance policy it issued.  An insurance company which did not attach the necessary stamps to a policy was subject to a fine of $50 for each failure to do so.<ref>''An Act to compel Assurers to take out a License'', ss. 1, 2, and 5.</ref>\n\nThe Queen Insurance Company was an insurance company doing business in Montreal.  It did not take out the licence required by the provincial legislation, and issued three insurance policies without paying the licensing fee.  The Attorney General for Quebec brought an action in the [[Superior Court of Quebec]] to recover the $50 penalty for each policy, for a total of $150.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company'' (1878), 3 AC 1090, at 1092-1093, [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/116/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 117], at pp. 120-121.</ref>\n\n== Decisions of the Quebec Courts ==\n===Decision of the Superior Court===  \n\nAt trial, the insurance company challenged the constitutional validity of the licence fee.  It argued that the legislation exceeded the provincial taxing power set out in section 92(2) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly the ''British North America Act, 1867''), as well as the provincial licensing power set out in s. 92(9).<ref>''[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/section-92.html#h-19 Constitution Act, 1867]'', 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3. (UK); RSC 1985, App. II, No. 11, s. 92.</ref>\n\nThe insurance company also argued that the provincial law conflicted with a federal act regulating insurance companies.  The company had complied with the federal legislation regulating insurance companies, and had paid a federal licensing charge of $150,000 under the federal law.<ref>''An Act respecting Insurance Companies'', SC 1868, c. 48.</ref>  It argued that the licence under the federal statute gave it the right to carry on the business of insurance, without paying a provincial licensing charge.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), p. 1093 (AC), p. 121 (Cart).</ref>\n\nThe insurance company was successful in the Superior Court.  Justice Torrance held that the law was an indirect tax and therefore not authorised by s. 92(2) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  Relying in part on American federalism precedents, he also held that the licensing provisions intruded on federal jurisdiction.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec pro Domina Regina v. Queen Insurance Co.'' (1877), [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/152/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 153], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_90128/page/n95/mode/2up 21 LC Jurist 77] (QC SC).</ref>\n\nThe Attorney General was represented at trial by [[Edward Carter (politician)|Edward Carter, QC, MP]] and [[Alexandre Lacoste|Alexander Lacoste, QC]].  The Queen Insurance Company was represented by [[John Abbott]], QC (future Prime Minister of Canada), and [[Joseph Doutre]], QC.\n\n===Decision of the Court of Queen's Bench===\n[[File:AntoineAimeDorion23.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion|Chief Justice Dorion]], one of the judges who held the Act was unconstitutional]]\n\nThe Attorney General appealed to the highest court in Quebec, the [[Quebec Court of Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)]].  By a 4-1 decision, the Queen's Bench agreed with the decision of the Superior Court and dismissed the appeal.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v. Queen Insurance Co.'' (1877), [https://archive.org/details/casesdecidedonbr01cartuoft/page/130/mode/2up 1 Cart BNA 131], 16 C.L.J. 198, [https://archive.org/details/cihm_90129/page/n337/mode/2up 22 LC Jurist 307] (QC QB).</ref>\n\nAll of the judges agreed that the stamp fee was an indirect tax, and therefore could not be supported under the provincial taxation power, given by s. 92(2) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 133, 138, 151 (Cart).</ref>\n\nHowever, they disagreed on whether the stamp duty could be upheld as a licence fee.  Four of the judges ([[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion|Chief Justice Dorion]] and Justices Taschereau, Monk and Tessier) agreed that the duty was not truly a licence fee, but simply a way to impose an indirect tax that was not within provincial authority under s. 92(9). The licence fee was therefore unconstitutional.\n<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 147, 151, and 153 (Cart)</ref> In dissent, Justice Ramsay would have held that the fee was a valid licence fee and therefore the statute could have been upheld on that basis.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at p. 135 (Cart).</ref>\n\nJustice Taschereau was the only one to address the issue of federal jurisdiction.  As part of his analysis of the provincial power to issue licence fees under s. 92(9), he held that insurance companies were subject to federal regulation under the federal jurisdiction over trade and commerce.<ref>''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 91(2).</ref> and therefore the province could not impose an additional licence on insurance companies doing business in the province.<ref>''Attorney General of Quebec v Queen Insurance Co.'' (QC QB), at pp. 147-148 (Cart).</ref>\n\n== Decision of the Judicial Committee ==\n\n[[File:Sir George Jessel.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Master of the Rolls]], who wrote the decision that the Act was unconstitutional]]\n\nThe Attorney General for Quebec then appealed the case to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, the [[court of last resort]] for [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]].  (At that time, appeals could go to the Judicial Committee directly from the provincial courts, bypassing the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].)  [[Judah P. Benjamin|Judah P. Benjamin, QC]] and [[John Rigby (politician)|John Rigby]] were counsel for the Attorney General, while the insurance company was represented by Mr Kay, QC and R.W. Gibbs.\n\nThe Judicial Committee dismissed the appeal from the bench, without calling on counsel for the insurance company.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 1096 (AC), p. 1 (UKPC), p. 125 (Cart).</ref>   [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessell]], [[Master of the Rolls]], gave the decison for the Committee. He agreed with the Quebec courts that the province did not have the power to impose the fee.  Reviewing the Act, he concluded that it was not really a licensing act at all, as there was no penalty for not taking out a licence, and no prohibition on carrying on business without a licence. The policies issued by an unlicensed insurance company were valid, provided they had a stamp on them.  He concluded that the only purpose of the Act was to raise a revenue.  The province therefore could not rely on s. 92(9) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' in support of the Act.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 1099 (AC), p. 4 (UKPC), p. 129 (Cart).</ref> \n\nThe sole question was whether the fee under the Act was direct or indirect taxation.  Jessel concluded that there was ample authority to conclude that a stamp fee of this type was a form of indirect taxation.  It was therefore beyond the provincial power to enact, and the Act was unconstitutional.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at pp. 1101-1102 (AC), pp. 5-6 (UKPC), pp. 129-131 (Cart).</ref>\n\nSince the case could be decided on the basis that the Act exeeded provincial jurisdiction, the Committee did not need to consider the interplay betwen provincial powers under s. 92 and federal powers under s. 91 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.<ref>''Attorney General for Quebec v Queen Insurance Company'' (JCPC), at p. 10967 (AC), p. 2 (UKPC), pp. 125-126 (Cart).</ref>\n\n== Significance of the decision ==\n\nThis was the first case where the Judicial Committee considered the scope of provincial taxation powers under s. 92(2), and provincial licensing powers under s. 92(9).  It was also the first case where the Judicial Committee held that a provincial statute was unconstitutional under the division of powers.\n\nThe decision has been regularly cited approvingly by the courts since it was made.  The most recent reference to it in the Supreme Court of Canada was in ''Ontario Home Builders' Assn. v. York Region Board of Education''.<ref>''Ontario Home Builders' Assn. v. York Region Board of Education'', [1996] 2 S.C.R. 929.</ref>  Academic commentators have also referred to the decision.<ref>[[G\u00e9rard La Forest|G.V. La Forest]], ''The Allocation of Taxing Power under the Canadian Constitution''.</ref>\n\nThe federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.<ref>Richard A. Olmsted, Q.C. (ed.), ''Decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relating to the British North America Act, 1867 and the Canadian Constitution, 1867-1954'', vol.

The monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins, or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal. With the invention and spread in use of paper money, gold coins were eventually supplanted by [[banknotes]], creating the ''gold bullion standard'', a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell [[gold bullion]] on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.\n\nLastly, countries may implement a ''gold exchange standard'', where the government guarantees a [[fixed exchange rate]], not to a specified amount of gold, but rather to the currency of another country that uses a gold standard. This creates a ''[[de facto]]'' gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself.\n\n===Origins===\nThe gold specie standard arose from the widespread acceptance of gold as currency.{{sfn|Lipsey|1975|pp=683-702}} Various commodities have been used as [[money]]; typically, the one that loses the least value over time becomes the accepted form.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordo|Dittmar|Gavin|2003}} \"in a world with two capital goods, the one with the lower depreciation rate emerges as commodity money\"</ref>\n\nThe use of gold as money began thousands of years ago in Asia Minor.<ref>{{Cite web|title = World's Oldest Coin - First Coins|url = http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html|website = rg.ancients.info|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early and high [[Middle Ages]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]], commonly known as the [[bezant]], was used widely throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.

Coins were struck in smaller and smaller numbers, and there was a proliferation of bank and stock notes used as money.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the 1790s, the United Kingdom suffered a silver shortage. It ceased to mint larger silver coins and instead issued \"token\" silver coins and overstruck foreign coins.  With the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Bank of England]] began the [[Great Recoinage of 1816|massive recoinage programme]] that created standard gold sovereigns, circulating crowns, half-crowns and eventually copper farthings in 1821.  The recoinage of silver after a long drought produced a burst of coins. The United Kingdom struck nearly 40 million shillings between 1816 and 1820, 17 million half crowns and 1.3 million silver crowns.\n\nThe [[Peel's Bill|1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments]] set 1823 as the date for resumption of convertibility, which was reached by 1821. Throughout the 1820s, small notes were issued by regional banks. This was restricted in 1826, while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches. In 1833 however, [[Bank of England]] notes were made [[legal tender]] and redemption by other banks was discouraged.  In 1844, the [[Bank Charter Act 1844|Bank Charter Act]] established that Bank of England notes were fully backed by gold and they became the legal standard.  According to the strict interpretation of the gold standard, this 1844 act marked the establishment of a full gold standard for British money.\n\nThe pound left the gold standard in 1931 and a number of currencies of countries that historically had performed a large amount of their trade in sterling were pegged to sterling instead of to gold. The Bank of England took the decision to leave the gold standard abruptly and unilaterally.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James Ashley|date=2016|title=Shocking Intellectual Austerity: The Role of Ideas in the Demise of the Gold Standard in Britain|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/shocking-intellectual-austerity-the-role-of-ideas-in-the-demise-of-the-gold-standard-in-britain/CD7287FFF28C7868C5925E68E3AA2E56|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=175\u2013207|doi=10.1017/S0020818315000314|issn=0020-8183|via=}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the 1780s, [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] recommended to Congress the value of a decimal system. This system would also apply to monies in the United States. The question was what type of standard: gold, silver or both.{{sfn|Walton|Rockoff|2010}} The United States adopted a silver standard based on the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollar]] in 1785.\n\n====International====\nFrom 1860 to 1871 various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarce silver ended.\n\nThe interaction between central banking and currency basis formed the primary source of monetary instability during this period. The combination of a restricted supply of notes, a government monopoly on note issuance and indirectly, a central bank and a single unit of value produced economic stability. Deviation from these conditions produced monetary crises.\n\nDevalued notes or leaving silver as a [[store of value]] caused economic problems. Governments, demanding specie as payment, could drain the money out of the economy. Economic development expanded need for credit. The need for a solid basis in monetary affairs produced a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.\n\n====Japan====\nFollowing Germany's decision after the 1870\u20131871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] to extract reparations to facilitate a move to the gold standard, Japan gained the needed reserves after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895.

In 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins. This resulted in a derivative silver standard, since the Bank of the United States was not required to fully back its currency with reserves. This began a long series of attempts by the United States to create a [[Bimetallism|bi-metallic standard]].\n\nThe intention was to use gold for large denominations, and silver for smaller denominations.  A problem with bimetallic standards was that the metals' absolute and relative market prices changed. The mint ratio (the rate at which the mint was obligated to pay/receive for gold relative to silver) remained fixed at 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold, whereas the market rate fluctuated from 15.5 to 1 to 16 to 1. With the [[Coinage Act of 1834]], Congress passed an act that changed the mint ratio to approximately 16 to 1. [[California gold rush|Gold discoveries in California]] in 1848 and later in Australia lowered the gold price relative to silver; this drove silver money from circulation because it was worth more in the market than as money.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}} Passage of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848 placed the U.S. on a strict hard-money standard. Doing business with the American government required gold or silver coins.\n\nGovernment accounts were legally separated from the banking system. However, the mint ratio (the fixed exchange rate between gold and silver at the mint) continued to overvalue gold. In 1853, the U.S. reduced the silver weight of coins to keep them in circulation and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage. In 1857 the final crisis of the free banking era began as American banks suspended payment in silver, with ripples through the developing international financial system. Due to the inflationary finance measures undertaken to help pay for the U.S. [[US Civil War|Civil War]], the government found it difficult to pay its obligations in gold or silver and suspended  payments of obligations not legally specified in specie (gold bonds); this led banks to suspend the conversion of bank liabilities (bank notes and deposits) into specie. In 1862 paper money was made legal tender. It was a [[fiat money]] (not convertible on demand at a fixed rate into specie). These notes came to be called \"[[Demand Note|greenbacks]]\".{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n====US: Post-Civil War====\nAfter the Civil War, Congress wanted to reestablish the metallic standard at pre-war rates. The market price of gold in greenbacks was above the pre-War fixed price ($20.67 per ounce of gold) requiring [[deflation]] to achieve the pre-War price. This was accomplished by growing the stock of money less rapidly than real output. By 1879 the market price matched the mint price of gold. The [[Coinage Act of 1873|coinage act of 1873]] (also known as the Crime of \u201873) demonetized silver. This act removed the 412.5 grain silver dollar from circulation. Subsequently silver was only used in coins worth less than $1 (fractional currency). With the resumption of convertibility on June 30, 1879 the government again paid its debts in gold, accepted greenbacks for customs and redeemed greenbacks on demand in gold. Greenbacks were therefore perfect substitutes for gold coins. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the use of silver and a return to the bimetallic standard were recurrent political issues, raised especially by [[William Jennings Bryan]], the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] and the  [[Free Silver]] movement. In 1900 the gold dollar was declared the standard unit of account and a gold reserve for government issued paper notes was established. Greenbacks, silver certificates, and silver dollars continued to be legal tender, all redeemable in gold.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n===Fluctuations in the U.S. gold stock, 1862\u20131877===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|US gold stock\n|-\n| 1862 || 59 tons\n|-\n| 1866 || 81 tons\n|-\n| 1875 || 50 tons\n|-\n| 1878 || 78 tons\n|}\nThe U.S. had a gold stock of 1.9 million ounces (59 t) in 1862. Stocks rose to 2.6 million ounces (81 t) in 1866, declined in 1875 to 1.6 million ounces (50 t) and rose to 2.5 million ounces (78 t) in 1878. Net exports did not mirror that pattern. In the decade before the Civil War net exports were roughly constant; postwar they varied erratically around pre-war levels, but fell significantly in 1877 and became negative in 1878 and 1879. The net import of gold meant that the foreign demand for American currency to purchase goods, services, and investments exceeded the corresponding American demands for foreign currencies. In the final years of the greenback period (1862\u20131879), gold production increased while gold exports decreased.  The decrease in gold exports was considered by some to be a result of changing monetary conditions. The demands for gold during this period were as a speculative vehicle, and for its primary use in the foreign exchange markets financing international trade. The major effect of the increase in gold demand by the public and Treasury was to reduce exports of gold and increase the Greenback price of gold relative to purchasing power.{{sfn|Friedman|Schwartz|1963|p=79}}\n\n===Gold exchange standard===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\nTowards the end of the 19th century, some silver standard countries began to peg their silver coin units to the gold standards of the United Kingdom or the United States. In 1898, [[British India]] pegged the silver [[rupee]] to the [[pound sterling]] at a fixed rate of 1s 4d, while in 1906, the [[Straits Settlements]] adopted a gold exchange standard against sterling, fixing the silver Straits dollar at 2s 4d.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Philippines]] pegged the silver peso/dollar to the U.S. dollar at 50 cents.

During the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] the German central bank ([[Reichsbank]]) issued enormous sums of non-convertible marks to support workers who were on strike against the French occupation and to buy foreign currency for reparations; this led to the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation of the early 1920s]] and the decimation of the German middle class.\n\nThe U.S. did not suspend the gold standard during the war.

The role of gold was severely constrained, as other countries\u2019 currencies were fixed in terms of the dollar. Many countries kept reserves in gold and settled accounts in gold. Still they preferred to settle balances with other currencies, with the American dollar becoming the favorite. The [[International Monetary Fund]] was established to help with the exchange process and assist nations in maintaining fixed rates. Within Bretton Woods adjustment was cushioned through credits that helped countries avoid deflation. Under the old standard, a country with an overvalued currency would lose gold and experience deflation until the currency was again valued correctly. Most countries defined their currencies in terms of dollars, but some countries imposed trading restrictions to protect reserves and exchange rates. Therefore, most countries' currencies were still basically inconvertible. In the late 1950s, the exchange restrictions were dropped and gold became an important element in international financial settlements.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n===Bretton Woods===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\n{{Main|Bretton Woods system}}\nAfter the [[Second World War]], a system similar to a gold standard and sometimes described as a \"gold exchange standard\" was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements. Under this system, many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and central banks could exchange dollar holdings into gold at the official exchange rate of $35 per ounce; this option was not available to firms or individuals. All currencies pegged to the dollar thereby had a fixed value in terms of gold.{{sfn|Lipsey|1975|pp=683-702}}\n\nStarting in the 1959\u20131969 administration of President [[Charles de Gaulle]] and continuing until 1970, France reduced its dollar reserves, exchanging them for gold at the official exchange rate, reducing U.S. economic influence. This, along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the [[Vietnam War]] and persistent balance of payments deficits, led U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to end international convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold on August 15, 1971 (the \"[[Nixon Shock]]\").\n\nThis was meant to be a temporary measure, with the gold price of the dollar and the official rate of exchanges remaining constant. Revaluing currencies was the main purpose of this plan. No official revaluation or redemption occurred. The dollar subsequently floated. In December 1971, the \"[[Smithsonian Agreement]]\" was reached. In this agreement, the dollar was devalued from $35 per troy ounce of gold to $38. Other countries' currencies appreciated. However, gold convertibility did not resume. In October 1973, the price was raised to $42.22. Once again, the devaluation was insufficient. Within two weeks of the second devaluation the dollar was left to float. The $42.22 par value was made official in September 1973, long after it had been abandoned in practice. In October 1976, the government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes. From this point, the international monetary system was made of pure fiat money.\n\n==Production of gold==\nAn estimated total of 174,100 [[tonne]]s of gold have been mined in human history, according to [[GFMS]] as of 2012. This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion [[troy ounce]]s or, in terms of volume, about {{convert|9261|m3}}, or a [[cube]] {{convert|21|m}} on a side. There are varying estimates of the total volume of gold mined. One reason for the variance is that gold has been mined for thousands of years. Another reason is that some nations are not particularly open about how much gold is being mined. In addition, it is difficult to account for the gold output in illegal mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21969100|title=How much gold is there in the world?|last=Prior|first=Ed|date=1 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>\n\nWorld production for 2011 was circa 2,700 [[tonne]]s.

Furthermore, it does not allow a government to manipulate the flow of commerce with the same ease that a fiat currency does. As such, commodity money gave way to [[representative money]] and gold and other [[Coin|specie]] were retained as its backing.\n\nGold was a preferred form of money due to its rarity, durability, divisibility, [[fungibility]] and ease of identification,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book|first=Shepard |last=Krech III |author2-first=John Robert |author2-last=McNeill |author3-first=Carolyn |author3-last=Merchant |author3-link=Carolyn Merchant |title=Encyclopedia of World Environmental History |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[New York City]] |year=2004 |volume=2: F\u2013N |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8whW1e\u2013jaHsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780415937344&cad=0#PPA597,M1 597] |isbn=978-0-415-93734-4 |oclc=174950341 }}</ref> often in conjunction with silver. Silver was typically the main circulating medium, with gold as the monetary reserve. Commodity money was anonymous, as identifying marks can be removed. Commodity money retains its value despite what may happen to the monetary authority. After the fall of [[South Vietnam]], many refugees carried their wealth to the West in gold after the national currency became worthless.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nUnder commodity standards currency itself has no intrinsic value, but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed any time for the equivalent specie. A U.S. [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]], for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver.\n\nRepresentative money and the gold standard protect citizens from [[hyperinflation]] and other abuses of monetary policy, as were seen in some countries during the Great Depression. Commodity money conversely led to deflation and bank runs.\n\nCountries that left the gold standard earlier than other countries recovered from the Great Depression sooner. For example, Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost entirely avoided the depression (due to the fact it was then barely integrated into the global economy). The connection between leaving the gold standard and the severity and duration of the depression was consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries. This may explain why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies.<ref>Bernanke, Ben (March 2, 2004), \"Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke: Money, Gold and the Great Depression\", At the H.

It is sometimes referred to as the gold specie standard to more easily distinguish it. Opponents of a full standard consider it difficult to implement, saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain worldwide economic activity at or near current gold prices; implementation would entail a many-fold increase in the price of gold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Gold standard proponents have said, \"Once a money is established, any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Herman|editor=Mark Skousen|title=Dissent on Keynes, A Critical Appraisal of Economics|url=https://mises.org/daily/2492#i2|year=1992|pages=199\u2013223}}</ref> While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold, the process may involve considerable economic disruption, as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain gold standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/Community/wikis/economics/gold-as-money-faq.aspx |title=Gold as Money: FAQ |work=Mises.org |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714174608/http://mises.org/Community/wikis/economics/gold-as-money-faq.aspx |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn an ''international gold-standard system'' (which is necessarily based on an internal gold standard in the countries concerned),<ref>The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd edition (2008), Vol.3, S.695</ref> gold or a currency that is convertible into gold at a fixed price is used to make international payments. Under such a system, when exchange rates rise above or fall below the fixed mint rate by more than the cost of shipping gold, inflows or outflows occur until rates return to the official level. International gold standards often limit which entities have the right to redeem currency for gold.\n\n== Impact ==\nA poll of forty prominent U.S. economists conducted by the IGM Economic Experts Panel in 2012 found that none of them believed that returning to the gold standard would be economically beneficial. The specific statement with which the economists were asked to agree or disagree was: \"If the U.S. replaced its discretionary monetary policy regime with a gold standard, defining a 'dollar' as a specific number of ounces of gold, the price-stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American.\" 40% of the economists disagreed, and 53% strongly disagreed with the statement; the rest did not respond to the question.

The monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins, or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal. With the invention and spread in use of paper money, gold coins were eventually supplanted by [[banknotes]], creating the ''gold bullion standard'', a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell [[gold bullion]] on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.\n\nLastly, countries may implement a ''gold exchange standard'', where the government guarantees a [[fixed exchange rate]], not to a specified amount of gold, but rather to the currency of another country that uses a gold standard. This creates a ''[[de facto]]'' gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself.\n\n===Origins===\nThe gold specie standard arose from the widespread acceptance of gold as currency.{{sfn|Lipsey|1975|pp=683-702}} Various commodities have been used as [[money]]; typically, the one that loses the least value over time becomes the accepted form.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordo|Dittmar|Gavin|2003}} \"in a world with two capital goods, the one with the lower depreciation rate emerges as commodity money\"</ref> Chemically, gold is of all major [[precious metal|metals]] the one most resistant to corrosion.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe use of gold as money began thousands of years ago in Asia Minor.<ref>{{Cite web|title = World's Oldest Coin - First Coins|url = http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html|website = rg.ancients.info|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early and high [[Middle Ages]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]], commonly known as the [[bezant]], was used widely throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.

Coins were struck in smaller and smaller numbers, and there was a proliferation of bank and stock notes used as money.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the 1790s, the United Kingdom suffered a silver shortage. It ceased to mint larger silver coins and instead issued \"token\" silver coins and overstruck foreign coins.  With the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Bank of England]] began the [[Great Recoinage of 1816|massive recoinage programme]] that created standard gold sovereigns, circulating crowns, half-crowns and eventually copper farthings in 1821.  The recoinage of silver after a long drought produced a burst of coins. The United Kingdom struck nearly 40 million shillings between 1816 and 1820, 17 million half crowns and 1.3 million silver crowns.\n\nThe [[Peel's Bill|1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments]] set 1823 as the date for resumption of convertibility, which was reached by 1821. Throughout the 1820s, small notes were issued by regional banks. This was restricted in 1826, while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches. In 1833 however, [[Bank of England]] notes were made [[legal tender]] and redemption by other banks was discouraged.  In 1844, the [[Bank Charter Act 1844|Bank Charter Act]] established that Bank of England notes were fully backed by gold and they became the legal standard.  According to the strict interpretation of the gold standard, this 1844 act marked the establishment of a full gold standard for British money.\n\nThe pound left the gold standard in 1931 and a number of currencies of countries that historically had performed a large amount of their trade in sterling were pegged to sterling instead of to gold. The Bank of England took the decision to leave the gold standard abruptly and unilaterally.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James Ashley|date=2016|title=Shocking Intellectual Austerity: The Role of Ideas in the Demise of the Gold Standard in Britain|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/shocking-intellectual-austerity-the-role-of-ideas-in-the-demise-of-the-gold-standard-in-britain/CD7287FFF28C7868C5925E68E3AA2E56|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=175\u2013207|doi=10.1017/S0020818315000314|issn=0020-8183|via=}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the 1780s, [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] recommended to Congress the value of a decimal system. This system would also apply to monies in the United States. The question was what type of standard: gold, silver or both.{{sfn|Walton|Rockoff|2010}} The United States adopted a silver standard based on the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollar]] in 1785.\n\n====International====\nFrom 1860 to 1871 various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarce silver ended.\n\nThe interaction between central banking and currency basis formed the primary source of monetary instability during this period. The combination of a restricted supply of notes, a government monopoly on note issuance and indirectly, a central bank and a single unit of value produced economic stability. Deviation from these conditions produced monetary crises.\n\nDevalued notes or leaving silver as a [[store of value]] caused economic problems. Governments, demanding specie as payment, could drain the money out of the economy. Economic development expanded need for credit. The need for a solid basis in monetary affairs produced a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.\n\n====Japan====\nFollowing Germany's decision after the 1870\u20131871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] to extract reparations to facilitate a move to the gold standard, Japan gained the needed reserves after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895.

It authorized the federal government's use of the Bank of the United States to hold its reserves, as well as establish a fixed ratio of gold to the U.S. dollar. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, as was the [[Spanish real]]. In 1792 the market price of gold was about 15 times that of silver.{{sfn|Walton|Rockoff|2010}} Silver coins left circulation, exported to pay for the debts taken on to finance the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins. This resulted in a derivative silver standard, since the Bank of the United States was not required to fully back its currency with reserves. This began a long series of attempts by the United States to create a [[Bimetallism|bi-metallic standard]].\n\nThe intention was to use gold for large denominations, and silver for smaller denominations.  A problem with bimetallic standards was that the metals' absolute and relative market prices changed. The mint ratio (the rate at which the mint was obligated to pay/receive for gold relative to silver) remained fixed at 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold, whereas the market rate fluctuated from 15.5 to 1 to 16 to 1. With the [[Coinage Act of 1834]], Congress passed an act that changed the mint ratio to approximately 16 to 1. [[California gold rush|Gold discoveries in California]] in 1848 and later in Australia lowered the gold price relative to silver; this drove silver money from circulation because it was worth more in the market than as money.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}} Passage of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848 placed the U.S. on a strict hard-money standard. Doing business with the American government required gold or silver coins.\n\nGovernment accounts were legally separated from the banking system. However, the mint ratio (the fixed exchange rate between gold and silver at the mint) continued to overvalue gold. In 1853, the U.S. reduced the silver weight of coins to keep them in circulation and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage. In 1857 the final crisis of the free banking era began as American banks suspended payment in silver, with ripples through the developing international financial system. Due to the inflationary finance measures undertaken to help pay for the U.S. [[US Civil War|Civil War]], the government found it difficult to pay its obligations in gold or silver and suspended  payments of obligations not legally specified in specie (gold bonds); this led banks to suspend the conversion of bank liabilities (bank notes and deposits) into specie. In 1862 paper money was made legal tender. It was a [[fiat money]] (not convertible on demand at a fixed rate into specie). These notes came to be called \"[[Demand Note|greenbacks]]\".{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n====US: Post-Civil War====\nAfter the Civil War, Congress wanted to reestablish the metallic standard at pre-war rates. The market price of gold in greenbacks was above the pre-War fixed price ($20.67 per ounce of gold) requiring [[deflation]] to achieve the pre-War price. This was accomplished by growing the stock of money less rapidly than real output. By 1879 the market price matched the mint price of gold. The [[Coinage Act of 1873|coinage act of 1873]] (also known as the Crime of \u201873) demonetized silver. This act removed the 412.5 grain silver dollar from circulation. Subsequently silver was only used in coins worth less than $1 (fractional currency). With the resumption of convertibility on June 30, 1879 the government again paid its debts in gold, accepted greenbacks for customs and redeemed greenbacks on demand in gold. Greenbacks were therefore perfect substitutes for gold coins. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the use of silver and a return to the bimetallic standard were recurrent political issues, raised especially by [[William Jennings Bryan]], the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] and the  [[Free Silver]] movement. In 1900 the gold dollar was declared the standard unit of account and a gold reserve for government issued paper notes was established. Greenbacks, silver certificates, and silver dollars continued to be legal tender, all redeemable in gold.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n===Fluctuations in the U.S. gold stock, 1862\u20131877===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|US gold stock\n|-\n| 1862 || 59 tons\n|-\n| 1866 || 81 tons\n|-\n| 1875 || 50 tons\n|-\n| 1878 || 78 tons\n|}\nThe U.S. had a gold stock of 1.9 million ounces (59 t) in 1862. Stocks rose to 2.6 million ounces (81 t) in 1866, declined in 1875 to 1.6 million ounces (50 t) and rose to 2.5 million ounces (78 t) in 1878. Net exports did not mirror that pattern. In the decade before the Civil War net exports were roughly constant; postwar they varied erratically around pre-war levels, but fell significantly in 1877 and became negative in 1878 and 1879. The net import of gold meant that the foreign demand for American currency to purchase goods, services, and investments exceeded the corresponding American demands for foreign currencies. In the final years of the greenback period (1862\u20131879), gold production increased while gold exports decreased.  The decrease in gold exports was considered by some to be a result of changing monetary conditions. The demands for gold during this period were as a speculative vehicle, and for its primary use in the foreign exchange markets financing international trade. The major effect of the increase in gold demand by the public and Treasury was to reduce exports of gold and increase the Greenback price of gold relative to purchasing power.{{sfn|Friedman|Schwartz|1963|p=79}}\n\n===Gold exchange standard===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\nTowards the end of the 19th century, some silver standard countries began to peg their silver coin units to the gold standards of the United Kingdom or the United States. In 1898, [[British India]] pegged the silver [[rupee]] to the [[pound sterling]] at a fixed rate of 1s 4d, while in 1906, the [[Straits Settlements]] adopted a gold exchange standard against sterling, fixing the silver Straits dollar at 2s 4d.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Philippines]] pegged the silver peso/dollar to the U.S. dollar at 50 cents.

Price levels doubled in the U.S. and Britain, tripled in France and quadrupled in Italy. Exchange rates changed less, even though European inflations were more severe than America's. This meant that the costs of American goods decreased relative to those in Europe. Between August 1914 and spring of 1915, the dollar value of U.S. exports tripled and its trade surplus exceeded $1 billion for the first time.{{sfn|Eichengreen|1995}}\n\nUltimately, the system could not deal quickly enough with the large [[balance of payments]] deficits and surpluses; this was previously attributed to downward wage rigidity brought about by the advent of [[trade union|unionized labor]], but is now considered as an inherent fault of the system that arose under the pressures of war and rapid technological change. In any case, prices had not reached equilibrium by the time of the [[Great Depression]], which served to kill off the system completely.{{sfn|Lipsey|1975|pp=683-702}}\n\nFor example, [[Germany]] had gone off the gold standard in 1914, and could not effectively return to it because [[War reparations]] had cost it much of its gold reserves. During the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] the German central bank ([[Reichsbank]]) issued enormous sums of non-convertible marks to support workers who were on strike against the French occupation and to buy foreign currency for reparations; this led to the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation of the early 1920s]] and the decimation of the German middle class.\n\nThe U.S. did not suspend the gold standard during the war.

Reich,  published 2010 Chapter 1 Eccles's Insight.</ref>\n\n====World War II====\nUnder the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary agreement of 1944]], the gold standard was kept without domestic convertibility. The role of gold was severely constrained, as other countries\u2019 currencies were fixed in terms of the dollar. Many countries kept reserves in gold and settled accounts in gold. Still they preferred to settle balances with other currencies, with the American dollar becoming the favorite. The [[International Monetary Fund]] was established to help with the exchange process and assist nations in maintaining fixed rates. Within Bretton Woods adjustment was cushioned through credits that helped countries avoid deflation. Under the old standard, a country with an overvalued currency would lose gold and experience deflation until the currency was again valued correctly. Most countries defined their currencies in terms of dollars, but some countries imposed trading restrictions to protect reserves and exchange rates. Therefore, most countries' currencies were still basically inconvertible. In the late 1950s, the exchange restrictions were dropped and gold became an important element in international financial settlements.{{sfn|Elwell|2011}}\n\n===Bretton Woods===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\n{{Main|Bretton Woods system}}\nAfter the [[Second World War]], a system similar to a gold standard and sometimes described as a \"gold exchange standard\" was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements. Under this system, many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and central banks could exchange dollar holdings into gold at the official exchange rate of $35 per ounce; this option was not available to firms or individuals. All currencies pegged to the dollar thereby had a fixed value in terms of gold.{{sfn|Lipsey|1975|pp=683-702}}\n\nStarting in the 1959\u20131969 administration of President [[Charles de Gaulle]] and continuing until 1970, France reduced its dollar reserves, exchanging them for gold at the official exchange rate, reducing U.S. economic influence. This, along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the [[Vietnam War]] and persistent balance of payments deficits, led U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to end international convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold on August 15, 1971 (the \"[[Nixon Shock]]\").\n\nThis was meant to be a temporary measure, with the gold price of the dollar and the official rate of exchanges remaining constant. Revaluing currencies was the main purpose of this plan. No official revaluation or redemption occurred. The dollar subsequently floated. In December 1971, the \"[[Smithsonian Agreement]]\" was reached. In this agreement, the dollar was devalued from $35 per troy ounce of gold to $38. Other countries' currencies appreciated. However, gold convertibility did not resume. In October 1973, the price was raised to $42.22. Once again, the devaluation was insufficient. Within two weeks of the second devaluation the dollar was left to float. The $42.22 par value was made official in September 1973, long after it had been abandoned in practice. In October 1976, the government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes. From this point, the international monetary system was made of pure fiat money.\n\n==Production of gold==\nAn estimated total of 174,100 [[tonne]]s of gold have been mined in human history, according to [[GFMS]] as of 2012. This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion [[troy ounce]]s or, in terms of volume, about {{convert|9261|m3}}, or a [[cube]] {{convert|21|m}} on a side. There are varying estimates of the total volume of gold mined. One reason for the variance is that gold has been mined for thousands of years. Another reason is that some nations are not particularly open about how much gold is being mined. In addition, it is difficult to account for the gold output in illegal mining activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21969100|title=How much gold is there in the world?|last=Prior|first=Ed|date=1 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>\n\nWorld production for 2011 was circa 2,700 [[tonne]]s.

Furthermore, it does not allow a government to manipulate the flow of commerce with the same ease that a fiat currency does. As such, commodity money gave way to [[representative money]] and gold and other [[Coin|specie]] were retained as its backing.\n\nGold was a preferred form of money due to its rarity, durability, divisibility, [[fungibility]] and ease of identification,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book|first=Shepard |last=Krech III |author2-first=John Robert |author2-last=McNeill |author3-first=Carolyn |author3-last=Merchant |author3-link=Carolyn Merchant |title=Encyclopedia of World Environmental History |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[New York City]] |year=2004 |volume=2: F\u2013N |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8whW1e\u2013jaHsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780415937344&cad=0#PPA597,M1 597] |isbn=978-0-415-93734-4 |oclc=174950341 }}</ref> often in conjunction with silver. Silver was typically the main circulating medium, with gold as the monetary reserve. Commodity money was anonymous, as identifying marks can be removed. Commodity money retains its value despite what may happen to the monetary authority. After the fall of [[South Vietnam]], many refugees carried their wealth to the West in gold after the national currency became worthless.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nUnder commodity standards currency itself has no intrinsic value, but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed any time for the equivalent specie. A U.S. [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]], for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver.\n\nRepresentative money and the gold standard protect citizens from [[hyperinflation]] and other abuses of monetary policy, as were seen in some countries during the Great Depression. Commodity money conversely led to deflation and bank runs.\n\nCountries that left the gold standard earlier than other countries recovered from the Great Depression sooner. For example, Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost entirely avoided the depression (due to the fact it was then barely integrated into the global economy). The connection between leaving the gold standard and the severity and duration of the depression was consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries. This may explain why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies.<ref>Bernanke, Ben (March 2, 2004), \"Remarks by Governor Ben S.

It is sometimes referred to as the gold specie standard to more easily distinguish it. Opponents of a full standard consider it difficult to implement, saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain worldwide economic activity at or near current gold prices; implementation would entail a many-fold increase in the price of gold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Gold standard proponents have said, \"Once a money is established, any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Herman|editor=Mark Skousen|title=Dissent on Keynes, A Critical Appraisal of Economics|url=https://mises.org/daily/2492#i2|year=1992|pages=199\u2013223}}</ref> While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold, the process may involve considerable economic disruption, as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain gold standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/Community/wikis/economics/gold-as-money-faq.aspx |title=Gold as Money: FAQ |work=Mises.org |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714174608/http://mises.org/Community/wikis/economics/gold-as-money-faq.aspx |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn an ''international gold-standard system'' (which is necessarily based on an internal gold standard in the countries concerned),<ref>The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd edition (2008), Vol.3, S.695</ref> gold or a currency that is convertible into gold at a fixed price is used to make international payments. Under such a system, when exchange rates rise above or fall below the fixed mint rate by more than the cost of shipping gold, inflows or outflows occur until rates return to the official level.
