Located in [[Patagonia]], the city is the largest and most populous in the low valley of the [[Chubut River]], with 97,915 inhabitants as of 2010. The Trelew municipality is part of the [[Rawson Department, Chubut|Rawson Department]], whose capital, [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], is also the provincial capital.\n\nTrelew is an important commercial and industrial centre for the region and is the main hub for wool processing, accounting for 90 percent of activity in Argentina. The produce of this industry is mainly shipped and exported through [[Puerto Madryn]] and [[Puerto Deseado]].\n\nTrelew is home to the [[Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio]], showcasing the paleontological heritage of the Patagonic region, and considered one of the most important of its kind in [[South America]] and the Astronomic and Planetary Observatory.\n\nThe city is served by the [[Almirante Marcos A. Zar Airport]], of both civilian and military use. The airport's runway is shared with the Almirante Zar Naval Base, home of the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] squadron of the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]].\n\n==History==\n\nTrelew's foundation is linked with [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]], the leaders of which were [[Sir Love Jones-Parry, 1st Baronet|Captain Sir Love Jones-Parry]] of Madryn and [[Lewis Jones (Patagonia)|Lewis (Luis) Jones]], who acted as spokesmen to deal with the Argentine government in the beginning of the 1860s. The town was named Trelew in honour of Jones, ''tre'' meaning \"town\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and ''Lew'' being an [[apocope]] for ''Lewis''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trelew: a tour of the city|url=http://www.patagonia.com.ar/Trelew/116E_Trelew%3A+a+tour+of+the+city.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|publisher=Patagonia.com.ar}}</ref>\n\nTrelew was established on 20 October 1886 as the starting point for the [[Central Chubut Railway]] line that would link the lower [[Chubut River]] Valley to [[Puerto Madryn]]. Railway building equipment and 400 settlers arrived on July 28 of that same year on the steamer ''Vesta''. The line was opened in 1888 and later extended from Trelew to [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]], [[Dolavon]] and finally to [[Las Plumas]]. In 1961, the line was closed.\n\n===1972 massacre===\n\n{{main article|Trelew massacre}}\nTrelew was the scene of a massacre in 1972. A breakout of political prisoners at the federal penitentiary resulted in the death of one guard and the attempted flight of about 100 individuals who opposed the military dictatorship which followed the overthrow of President [[Arturo Illia]]. A small group of prisoners succeeded in commandeering a plane and flying to safety in [[Chile]]. The rest submitted to the authorities and were returned to a military prison, where 19 were shot (three survived).\n\nThe town of Trelew was searched by the military and locals were seized and taken to the [[Villa Devoto]] prison in [[Buenos Aires]]. Virtually the entire town went on strike and succeeded in securing the release of the prisoners at Villa Devoto. These incidents were documented in the book ''La Pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Trelew'', by [[Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez]], which was originally published in 1973, but was then suppressed by the dictatorship of the ''[[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|Proceso]]'', and reissued in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Trelew\", de Tom\u00e1s Eloy Martinez|url=http://entretenimiento.terra.com.ar/terra-libros/la-pasion-segun-trelew-de-tomas-eloy-martinez,b2ab90af847ad310VgnVCM3000009acceb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|work=Terra Argentina|date=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n\nTrelew is the centre of tourism in the Central Meseta, the Valley of the Chubut River and the coast. [[Punta Tombo]], the biggest [[penguin]] reserve in Argentina, is accessible from the city.\n\n==Sports==\n[[Racing de Trelew]] and Hurac\u00e1n de Trelew are the most important local football clubs. Patoruz\u00fa Rugby Club and Trelew Rugby Club are the local clubs practicing this sport.  In boxing, the Matthysse brothers, [[Lucas Matthysse]] and [[Walter Matthysse]] are from Trelew, although most of their notable fights took place in the United States.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Banco Nacion - Trelew.JPG|Argentina National Bank at night\nFile:A train of ox-drawn carts leaving Trelew, Patagonia.jpg|A train of ox-drawn carts leaving Trelew,c.1880\nFile:pueblo de luis.jpg|Welsh People's Museum, Trelew\nFile:Aeropuerto Viejo de Trelew - Centro Cultural por la Memoria 12.JPG|Former Airport of Trelew, now a \"cultural centre for the memory\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Climate==\nTrelew experiences a cool [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]) with warm summers, cool winters and low precipitation year-round.

Located in [[Patagonia]], the city is the largest and most populous in the low valley of the [[Chubut River]], with 97,915 inhabitants as of 2010. The Trelew municipality is part of the [[Rawson Department, Chubut|Rawson Department]], whose capital, [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], is also the provincial capital.\n\nTrelew is an important commercial and industrial centre for the region and is the main hub for wool processing, accounting for 90 percent of activity in Argentina. The produce of this industry is mainly shipped and exported through [[Puerto Madryn]] and [[Puerto Deseado]].\n\nTrelew is home to the [[Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio]], showcasing the paleontological heritage of the Patagonic region, and considered one of the most important of its kind in [[South America]] and the Astronomic and Planetary Observatory.\n\nThe city is served by the [[Almirante Marcos A. Zar Airport]], of both civilian and military use. The airport's runway is shared with the Almirante Zar Naval Base, home of the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] squadron of the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]].\n\n==History==\n\nTrelew's foundation is linked with [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]], the leaders of which were [[Sir Love Jones-Parry, 1st Baronet|Captain Sir Love Jones-Parry]] of Madryn and [[Lewis Jones (Patagonia)|Lewis (Luis) Jones]], who acted as spokesmen to deal with the Argentine government in the beginning of the 1860s. The town was named Trelew in honour of Jones, ''tre'' meaning \"town\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and ''Lew'' being an [[apocope]] for ''Lewis''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trelew: a tour of the city|url=http://www.patagonia.com.ar/Trelew/116E_Trelew%3A+a+tour+of+the+city.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|publisher=Patagonia.com.ar}}</ref>\n\nTrelew was established on 20 October 1886 as the starting point for the [[Central Chubut Railway]] line that would link the lower [[Chubut River]] Valley to [[Puerto Madryn]]. Railway building equipment and 400 settlers arrived on July 28 of that same year on the steamer ''Vesta''. The line was opened in 1888 and later extended from Trelew to [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]], [[Dolavon]] and finally to [[Las Plumas]]. In 1961, the line was closed.\n\n===1972 massacre===\n\n{{main article|Trelew massacre}}\nTrelew was the scene of a massacre in 1972. A breakout of political prisoners at the federal penitentiary resulted in the death of one guard and the attempted flight of about 100 individuals who opposed the military dictatorship which followed the overthrow of President [[Arturo Illia]]. A small group of prisoners succeeded in commandeering a plane and flying to safety in [[Chile]]. The rest submitted to the authorities and were returned to a military prison, where 19 were shot (three survived).\n\nThe town of Trelew was searched by the military and locals were seized and taken to the [[Villa Devoto]] prison in [[Buenos Aires]]. Virtually the entire town went on strike and succeeded in securing the release of the prisoners at Villa Devoto. These incidents were documented in the book ''La Pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Trelew'', by [[Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez]], which was originally published in 1973, but was then suppressed by the dictatorship of the ''[[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|Proceso]]'', and reissued in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Trelew\", de Tom\u00e1s Eloy Martinez|url=http://entretenimiento.terra.com.ar/terra-libros/la-pasion-segun-trelew-de-tomas-eloy-martinez,b2ab90af847ad310VgnVCM3000009acceb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|work=Terra Argentina|date=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n\nTrelew is the centre of tourism in the Central Meseta, the Valley of the Chubut River and the coast. [[Punta Tombo]], the biggest [[penguin]] reserve in Argentina, is accessible from the city.\n\n==Sports==\n[[Racing de Trelew]] and Hurac\u00e1n de Trelew are the most important local football clubs. Patoruz\u00fa Rugby Club and Trelew Rugby Club are the local clubs practicing this sport.  In boxing, the Matthysse brothers, [[Lucas Matthysse]] and [[Walter Matthysse]] are from Trelew, although most of their notable fights took place in the United States.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Banco Nacion - Trelew.JPG|Argentina National Bank at night\nFile:A train of ox-drawn carts leaving Trelew, Patagonia.jpg|A train of ox-drawn carts leaving Trelew,c.1880\nFile:pueblo de luis.jpg|Welsh People's Museum, Trelew\nFile:Aeropuerto Viejo de Trelew - Centro Cultural por la Memoria 12.JPG|Former Airport of Trelew, now a \"cultural centre for the memory\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Climate==\nTrelew experiences a cool [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]) with warm summers, cool winters and low precipitation year-round.

Her musical roots are in the Faroese ballads.\n\nMany of her songs are in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], some are in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and the most recent are in English.\n\n==Career==\nEiv\u00f8r was born in [[Sy\u00f0rug\u00f8ta]], [[Faroe Islands]]. At 13 she had her first performance on [[Faroese television]] and won a national singing contest the same year. In 1999, at the age of 15, Eiv\u00f8r joined the rock band Clickhaze.\n\nOne year later, in 2000, she released her first album, ''Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eivor.com/index.php?id=4|title=EIVOR.COM discography|access-date=16 December 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HOh4zfG?url=http://eivor.sweetgiggles.net/?id=4|archive-date=9 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is a mixture of classical Faroese ballads accompanied only by guitar and bass with jazz influences, and songs based on texts by famous [[Culture of the Faroe Islands#Literature and art|Faroese writers]], together with songs written by Eiv\u00f8r herself. By this time she was already a professional musician.\n\nIn 2001 she won the national Faroese band contest with her band Clickhaze [[Prix F\u00f8royar]]. In 2002 Eiv\u00f8r moved to [[Reykjav\u00edk]] to study classical and jazz music. A mentor of the Faroese music scene, [[Kristian Blak]], asked her to be the lead singer for the jazz group \u2013 [[Yggdrasil (band)|Yggdrasil]], which released its first album the same year.\n\nWell known as a jazz performer, she released a rock album with Clickhaze the same summer, thus again proving her wide range. Clickhaze made a very successful tour of the Faroes, Sweden, Denmark ([[Roskilde Festival]]), Iceland and [[Greenland]].\n\nAfter her second solo album, ''Kr\u00e1kan'', there occurred possibly the most important event in her career with her nomination in 2003 for the [[Icelandic Music Award]]s in no fewer than three categories. She was awarded ''best singer'' and ''best performer'' \u2013 normally only given to Icelandic artists.\n\nEducated as a classical vocalist, Eiv\u00f8r also sings with the Faroese [[symphony orchestra]] and sang solo in Kristian Blak's 2004 opera ''Firra''.\n\nHer album ''eiv\u00f8r'' from November 2004, featuring the Canadian [[Bill Bourne]], sold well in the U.S. and Canada. Bourne's contribution with acoustic guitar gave the project an American [[country music|country]] flavour, with Eiv\u00f8r contributing several songs in Faroese. In Iceland it was again in the charts, and was nominated for the Icelandic Music Award, together with an album by Bj\u00f6rk, though neither was successful.\n\nOn 9 February, Eiv\u00f8r was named ''Faroese of the year 2004'' (\u00e1rsins f\u00f8royingur 2004) \u2013 being the first person to ever bear this title \u2013 for \"Putting the Faroe Islands on the map in a positive way with her songs\".\n\nOn 7 March 2005, the [[Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] (DR) big band issued its 40th anniversary album. All titles on that CD are written and sung by Eiv\u00f8r. Once again she was honored in Iceland on 16 June with the national theatre award ''Gr\u00edma'' for her composing and performance in the piece ''\u00dalfhamssaga'', based on the [[Norse sagas]].\n\nEiv\u00f8r's 5th album ''Human Child'' was produced by [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]] and was issued in an English and a Faroese version under the title ''Mannabarn''. It was released on 18 July 2007 in the Faroes. The album was recorded throughout 2006 and early 2007 in [[Dublin]], Republic of Ireland. This was followed by an Irish tour in Summer 2007. The album charted on the [[Tracklisten]], the official Danish Albums Chart.<ref>[http://danishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Eiv%F8r+P%E1lsd%F3ttir&titel=Human+Child&cat=a DanishCharts.com Eiv\u00f6r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 ''Human Child'' album page]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Eiv\u00f8r collaborated with the English classical composer Gavin Bryars on ''Tr\u00f3ndur i G\u00f8tu'', a work for two voices \u2013 hers and that of Faroese bass R\u00fani Brattaberg \u2013 choir and chamber orchestra (Ald\u00fabaran), based on a 10th-century Faroese saga hero. It was performed in G\u00f8tu, Faroe Islands on 12 July 2008. She has recently worked with Gavin Bryars again on a chamber opera ''Marilyn Forever'' based on [[Marilyn Monroe]], with libretto by Marilyn Bowering and produced by Aventa (Canada) in which Eiv\u00f8r played the leading role.<ref>Bryars about the chamber opera ''Anyone can see I love you'': [http://www.gavinbryars.com/info/biography gavinbryars.com]</ref> Parts of this were developed during a workshop in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], Canada in June 2010 and two scenes were performed there on 12 June 2010.<ref>Workshop for new chamber opera: [http://www.gavinbryars.com/calendar/anyone-can-see-i-love-you gavinbryars.com]</ref> The opera was performed in Victoria British Columbia at the McPherson Theatre in September 2013 produced by Aventa, and with co-star Thomas Sandberg.\n\nEiv\u00f8r's 2010 album ''Larva'' presented a new side of Eiv\u00f8r, as she moves away from the folk sound of recent years into a more experimental and raw musical style. It included haunting renditions of arrangements by Faroe Islands classical composer, Tr\u00f3ndur Bogason, the Icelandic string quartet Kaputt, the Faroese choir [[Mpiri]] and a children's choir from Eiv\u00f8r's hometown of G\u00f8ta.\n\nIn 2012 she married the Faroese composer [[Tr\u00f3ndur Bogason]]; they worked together with her album ''Room'',<ref>[http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ Lydtapet.net, Anmeldelse: EIV\u00d8R \u2013 ROOM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108022532/http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ |date=8 January 2014 }} (''in Danish'')</ref> which won huge acclaim and made her win three awards, \"Best female singer\" and \"Best artist\" and \"Best album of the Year\" during the Planet Awards( Faroese music awards). In 2013 she released a single \"Dansa\u00f0u vindur\", a cover of the 1996 Swedish Eurovision song \"[[Den vilda]]\" by [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]] with new lyrics. The song charted in Iceland.<ref>[http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ Tonlist: Netlistinn viku 46, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215133344/http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ |date=15 December 2013 }} (in Icelandic)</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Eiv\u00f8r released two albums, ''Bridges'' and ''Sl\u00f8r'', where the former was sung exclusively in English and the latter in her native tongue, Faroese. Eiv\u00f8r only meant to make one album sung in English, which ended up being ''Bridges'', but she got so inspired during the writing of it to do a Faroese \"sister\" album that she ended up doing two albums instead of one. As she put it in an interview with stacjaislandia.pl, \"My next album ''SL\u00d8R''. It\u00b4s a sister release to ''Bridges''. All lyrics are written in the same period as the songs on ''Bridges'', only the lyrics in ''SL\u00d8R'' are in my native language Faroese. While I was writing the songs they kept coming to me in such a manner that I would write a lyric in English and straight afterwards a lyric in Faroese would arrive \u2013 a kind of mirror image or reflection. Most of the songs were written together in pairs. The albums are therefore two different works yet also a unity. This has been my dream project for over 2 years now.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stacjaislandia.pl/aktualnosci/english/interviews/eivor-music-means-the-world-to-me-interview/|title=Eiv\u00f8r \u2013 Music means the world to me (interview)|first=Marcin|last=Kozicki|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Eiv\u00f8r appeared at the start of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016|E3 2016 Sony Press Conference]] where she along with the live orchestra performed the theme to the [[God of War (2018 video game)|''God of War'' video game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxfk7JNNDI|title=Sony Press Conference Orchestra - Live at E3 2016|first=|last=GameSpot|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir'' (SHD 50, [[Tutl]] Records, 2000)\n* ''Clickhaze EP'' (HJF 91, [[Tutl]] Records, 2002)\n* ''Yggdrasil'' (HJF 88, [[Tutl]] Records, 2002)\n* ''Kr\u00e1kan'' (12T001, 12 t\u00f3nar 2003)\n* ''Eiv\u00f8r'' (12T010, 12 t\u00f3nar 2004)\n* ''Tr\u00f8llabundin'' (together with the Big band of [[Danmarks Radio]] 2005)\n* ''Human Child'' (R 60117-2, [[RecArt Music]] 2007)\n* ''Mannabarn'' (R 60116-2, RecArt Music 2007, Faroese version of ''Human Child'')\n<!-- the next reference is for giving a proof that the peculiar spelling of Eiv\u00f8r (Swedish style, with ''\u00f6'') on the original media is not an editor's typo --> \n* ''Eiv\u00f6r Live''<ref>[http://www.tutl.com/shop/index.php?productID=431 tutl.com ''Eiv\u00f6r Live'' album page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529090552/http://www.tutl.com/shop/index.php?productID=431 |date=29 May 2014 }}</ref>\n* ''Undo your mind EP'' ([[Copenhagen Records]] 2010)\n* ''Larva'' (SHD 130, [[Tutl]] Records, 2010)\n* ''Room'' (SHD145, [[Tutl]] Records, 2012)\n* ''The Color of Dark'' (with Ginman) (2014)\n* ''Bridges'' (SHD155, [[Tutl]] Records, 2015)\n* ''Sl\u00f8r'' (SHD165, [[Tutl]] Records, 2015)\n* ''At The Heart of a Selkie'' (with Peter Jensen & The Danish Radio Big Band, and The Danish National Vocal Ensemble (SHD175, [[Tutl]] Records, 2016)\n* ''Sl\u00f8r'' (AGs1701, [[Tutl]] Records, licensed to A&G Records Ltd., English edition of Sl\u00f8r, 2017)\n\n===Singles===\n* \"Undo Your Mind\" (2010)\n* \"[[Den Vilda#Dansa\u00f0u vindur|Dansa\u00f0u vindur]]\" (2013)\n* \"Faithful Friend\" (2015)\n* \"Remember Me\" (2015)\n* \"In My Shoes\" (2017)\n\n==Also appears on==\n*[[Nephew (band)|Nephew]] feat.

Her musical roots are in the Faroese ballads.\n\nMany of her songs are in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], some are in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]],[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and the most recent are in English.\n\n==Career==\nEiv\u00f8r was born in [[Sy\u00f0rug\u00f8ta]], [[Faroe Islands]]. At 13 she had her first performance on [[Faroese television]] and won a national singing contest the same year. In 1999, at the age of 15, Eiv\u00f8r joined the rock band Clickhaze.\n\nOne year later, in 2000, she released her first album, ''Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eivor.com/index.php?id=4|title=EIVOR.COM discography|access-date=16 December 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HOh4zfG?url=http://eivor.sweetgiggles.net/?id=4|archive-date=9 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is a mixture of classical Faroese ballads accompanied only by guitar and bass with jazz influences, and songs based on texts by famous [[Culture of the Faroe Islands#Literature and art|Faroese writers]], together with songs written by Eiv\u00f8r herself. By this time she was already a professional musician.\n\nIn 2001 she won the national Faroese band contest with her band Clickhaze [[Prix F\u00f8royar]]. In 2002 Eiv\u00f8r moved to [[Reykjav\u00edk]] to study classical and jazz music. A mentor of the Faroese music scene, [[Kristian Blak]], asked her to be the lead singer for the jazz group \u2013 [[Yggdrasil (band)|Yggdrasil]], which released its first album the same year.\n\nWell known as a jazz performer, she released a rock album with Clickhaze the same summer, thus again proving her wide range. Clickhaze made a very successful tour of the Faroes, Sweden, Denmark ([[Roskilde Festival]]), Iceland and [[Greenland]].\n\nAfter her second solo album, ''Kr\u00e1kan'', there occurred possibly the most important event in her career with her nomination in 2003 for the [[Icelandic Music Award]]s in no fewer than three categories. She was awarded ''best singer'' and ''best performer'' \u2013 normally only given to Icelandic artists.\n\nEducated as a classical vocalist, Eiv\u00f8r also sings with the Faroese [[symphony orchestra]] and sang solo in Kristian Blak's 2004 opera ''Firra''.\n\nHer album ''eiv\u00f8r'' from November 2004, featuring the Canadian [[Bill Bourne]], sold well in the U.S. and Canada. Bourne's contribution with acoustic guitar gave the project an American [[country music|country]] flavour, with Eiv\u00f8r contributing several songs in Faroese. In Iceland it was again in the charts, and was nominated for the Icelandic Music Award, together with an album by Bj\u00f6rk, though neither was successful.\n\nOn 9 February, Eiv\u00f8r was named ''Faroese of the year 2004'' (\u00e1rsins f\u00f8royingur 2004) \u2013 being the first person to ever bear this title \u2013 for \"Putting the Faroe Islands on the map in a positive way with her songs\".\n\nOn 7 March 2005, the [[Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] (DR) big band issued its 40th anniversary album. All titles on that CD are written and sung by Eiv\u00f8r. Once again she was honored in Iceland on 16 June with the national theatre award ''Gr\u00edma'' for her composing and performance in the piece ''\u00dalfhamssaga'', based on the [[Norse sagas]].\n\nEiv\u00f8r's 5th album ''Human Child'' was produced by [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]] and was issued in an English and a Faroese version under the title ''Mannabarn''. It was released on 18 July 2007 in the Faroes. The album was recorded throughout 2006 and early 2007 in [[Dublin]], Republic of Ireland. This was followed by an Irish tour in Summer 2007. The album charted on the [[Tracklisten]], the official Danish Albums Chart.<ref>[http://danishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Eiv%F8r+P%E1lsd%F3ttir&titel=Human+Child&cat=a DanishCharts.com Eiv\u00f6r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 ''Human Child'' album page]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Eiv\u00f8r collaborated with the English classical composer Gavin Bryars on ''Tr\u00f3ndur i G\u00f8tu'', a work for two voices \u2013 hers and that of Faroese bass R\u00fani Brattaberg \u2013 choir and chamber orchestra (Ald\u00fabaran), based on a 10th-century Faroese saga hero. It was performed in G\u00f8tu, Faroe Islands on 12 July 2008. She has recently worked with Gavin Bryars again on a chamber opera ''Marilyn Forever'' based on [[Marilyn Monroe]], with libretto by Marilyn Bowering and produced by Aventa (Canada) in which Eiv\u00f8r played the leading role.<ref>Bryars about the chamber opera ''Anyone can see I love you'': [http://www.gavinbryars.com/info/biography gavinbryars.com]</ref> Parts of this were developed during a workshop in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], Canada in June 2010 and two scenes were performed there on 12 June 2010.<ref>Workshop for new chamber opera: [http://www.gavinbryars.com/calendar/anyone-can-see-i-love-you gavinbryars.com]</ref> The opera was performed in Victoria British Columbia at the McPherson Theatre in September 2013 produced by Aventa, and with co-star Thomas Sandberg.\n\nEiv\u00f8r's 2010 album ''Larva'' presented a new side of Eiv\u00f8r, as she moves away from the folk sound of recent years into a more experimental and raw musical style. It included haunting renditions of arrangements by Faroe Islands classical composer, Tr\u00f3ndur Bogason, the Icelandic string quartet Kaputt, the Faroese choir [[Mpiri]] and a children's choir from Eiv\u00f8r's hometown of G\u00f8ta.\n\nIn 2012 she married the Faroese composer [[Tr\u00f3ndur Bogason]]; they worked together with her album ''Room'',<ref>[http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ Lydtapet.net, Anmeldelse: EIV\u00d8R \u2013 ROOM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108022532/http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ |date=8 January 2014 }} (''in Danish'')</ref> which won huge acclaim and made her win three awards, \"Best female singer\" and \"Best artist\" and \"Best album of the Year\" during the Planet Awards( Faroese music awards). In 2013 she released a single \"Dansa\u00f0u vindur\", a cover of the 1996 Swedish Eurovision song \"[[Den vilda]]\" by [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]] with new lyrics. The song charted in Iceland.<ref>[http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ Tonlist: Netlistinn viku 46, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215133344/http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ |date=15 December 2013 }} (in Icelandic)</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Eiv\u00f8r released two albums, ''Bridges'' and ''Sl\u00f8r'', where the former was sung exclusively in English and the latter in her native tongue, Faroese. Eiv\u00f8r only meant to make one album sung in English, which ended up being ''Bridges'', but she got so inspired during the writing of it to do a Faroese \"sister\" album that she ended up doing two albums instead of one. As she put it in an interview with stacjaislandia.pl, \"My next album ''SL\u00d8R''. It\u00b4s a sister release to ''Bridges''. All lyrics are written in the same period as the songs on ''Bridges'', only the lyrics in ''SL\u00d8R'' are in my native language Faroese. While I was writing the songs they kept coming to me in such a manner that I would write a lyric in English and straight afterwards a lyric in Faroese would arrive \u2013 a kind of mirror image or reflection. Most of the songs were written together in pairs. The albums are therefore two different works yet also a unity. This has been my dream project for over 2 years now.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stacjaislandia.pl/aktualnosci/english/interviews/eivor-music-means-the-world-to-me-interview/|title=Eiv\u00f8r \u2013 Music means the world to me (interview)|first=Marcin|last=Kozicki|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Eiv\u00f8r appeared at the start of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016|E3 2016 Sony Press Conference]] where she along with the live orchestra performed the theme to the [[God of War (2018 video game)|''God of War'' video game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxfk7JNNDI|title=Sony Press Conference Orchestra - Live at E3 2016|first=|last=GameSpot|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir'' (SHD 50, [[Tutl]] Records, 2000)\n* ''Clickhaze EP'' (HJF 91, [[Tutl]] Records, 2002)\n* ''Yggdrasil'' (HJF 88, [[Tutl]] Records, 2002)\n* ''Kr\u00e1kan'' (12T001, 12 t\u00f3nar 2003)\n* ''Eiv\u00f8r'' (12T010, 12 t\u00f3nar 2004)\n* ''Tr\u00f8llabundin'' (together with the Big band of [[Danmarks Radio]] 2005)\n* ''Human Child'' (R 60117-2, [[RecArt Music]] 2007)\n* ''Mannabarn'' (R 60116-2, RecArt Music 2007, Faroese version of ''Human Child'')\n<!-- the next reference is for giving a proof that the peculiar spelling of Eiv\u00f8r (Swedish style, with ''\u00f6'') on the original media is not an editor's typo --> \n* ''Eiv\u00f6r Live''<ref>[http://www.tutl.com/shop/index.php?productID=431 tutl.com ''Eiv\u00f6r Live'' album page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529090552/http://www.tutl.com/shop/index.php?productID=431 |date=29 May 2014 }}</ref>\n* ''Undo your mind EP'' ([[Copenhagen Records]] 2010)\n* ''Larva'' (SHD 130, [[Tutl]] Records, 2010)\n* ''Room'' (SHD145, [[Tutl]] Records, 2012)\n* ''The Color of Dark'' (with Ginman) (2014)\n* ''Bridges'' (SHD155, [[Tutl]] Records, 2015)\n* ''Sl\u00f8r'' (SHD165, [[Tutl]] Records, 2015)\n* ''At The Heart of a Selkie'' (with Peter Jensen & The Danish Radio Big Band, and The Danish National Vocal Ensemble (SHD175, [[Tutl]] Records, 2016)\n* ''Sl\u00f8r'' (AGs1701, [[Tutl]] Records, licensed to A&G Records Ltd., English edition of Sl\u00f8r, 2017)\n\n===Singles===\n* \"Undo Your Mind\" (2010)\n* \"[[Den Vilda#Dansa\u00f0u vindur|Dansa\u00f0u vindur]]\" (2013)\n* \"Faithful Friend\" (2015)\n* \"Remember Me\" (2015)\n* \"In My Shoes\" (2017)\n\n==Also appears on==\n*[[Nephew (band)|Nephew]] feat.
