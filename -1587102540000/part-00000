{"title_page": "Constituent (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[syntax|syntactic]] analysis, a '''constituent''' is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>Dogs will always chase cats.</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> '''Dogs and eagles'''] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''cats or birds'''].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> '''always and only'''] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> '''will and should'''] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase and bite'''] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> '''down the hill and to the store'''].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> '''if they are playful and if they are sociable'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n# * Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase cats and down the hill'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n==== '''Do so substitution''' ====\nDo so substitution is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing a VP with do so. If a string S can be substituted for do so, then S is hypothesized to be a VP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n# Dogs will [always chase cats], and eagles will [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''] too.\n# Dogs will always [chase cats], but eagles will never [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the words do so are replaced by for a non-VP.\n\n1. * Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that by using the test we can determine which sequences of words are VP constituents. The first two sentences substitute do so for different VPs. In the first example, do so replaces the entire VP, but in the second, do so replaces the verb and excludes the adverb. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since cats is an DP, and therefore not compliant with this test.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>Dogs will always chase cats.</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> '''Dogs and eagles'''] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''cats or birds'''].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> '''always and only'''] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> '''will and should'''] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase and bite'''] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> '''down the hill and to the store'''].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> '''if they are playful and if they are sociable'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n# * Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase cats and down the hill'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n'''Do so substitution''' \n\nDo so substitution is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing a VP with do so. If a string S can be substituted for do so, then S is hypothesized to be a VP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n# Dogs will [always chase cats], and eagles will [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''] too.\n# Dogs will always [chase cats], but eagles will never [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the words do so are replaced by for a non-VP.\n\n1. * Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that by using the test we can determine which sequences of words are VP constituents. The first two sentences substitute do so for different VPs. In the first example, do so replaces the entire VP, but in the second, do so replaces the verb and excludes the adverb. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since cats is an DP, and therefore not compliant with this test.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The lower 53 miles (86&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]], in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] with a [[third rail]] and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the '''Wassaic Branch''', is a non-electrified single-track line served by [[diesel locomotive]]s. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.  [[Starting Saturday, March 28, 2020, weekend service on The Wassaic Branch is suspended until further notice.]]\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern [[Terminal station|terminal]], [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by [[Amtrak]], though [[CSX]] services freight customers as far north as [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the [[color code]] blue, used as trim on station signs and [[spot color]] on printed [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor [[New York Central]] for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iridetheharlemline.com/2012/09/21/the-harlem-line-and-the-color-blue/|title=The Harlem Line, and the color blue|last=Moser|first=Emily|date=September 21, 2012|website=I Ride The Harlem Line...|access-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"[[reverse commute|reverse commuting]]\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to [[Western Massachusetts]] that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|1}}<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==Line description==\n[[File:Railway map around New York City.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Railway diagram of intercity services around New York City, showing Penn Station and [[Grand Central Terminal]]]]\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along [[river]]-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major [[parkway]]s closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (and a short portion that becomes the [[Taconic State Parkway]]), the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] and [[Interstate 684]]. In the last section it also begins to run close to [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]], the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s.

Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauchfoundation.org/files/9913/5818/7008/How_the_LIRR_Could_Shape_the_Next_Economy.pdf|title=How the Long Island Rail Road Could Shape the Next Economy|date=2013|website=rauchfoundation.org|publisher=Regional Plan Association|pages=11\u201312|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/rail-line-upgrade-boosting-ridership-article-1.559742|title=RAIL LINE UPGRADE BOOSTING RIDERSHIP|last=Egbert|first=Bill|date=July 21, 2005|work=NY Daily News|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase by the MTA===\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a [[Interest rate#Related terms|discount rate]] of 6.25%.<ref name=purchase/> The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central.

The lower 53 miles (86&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]], in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] with a [[third rail]] and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the '''Wassaic Branch''', is a non-electrified single-track line served by [[diesel locomotive]]s. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern [[Terminal station|terminal]], [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by [[Amtrak]], though [[CSX]] services freight customers as far north as [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the [[color code]] blue, used as trim on station signs and [[spot color]] on printed [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor [[New York Central]] for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iridetheharlemline.com/2012/09/21/the-harlem-line-and-the-color-blue/|title=The Harlem Line, and the color blue|last=Moser|first=Emily|date=September 21, 2012|website=I Ride The Harlem Line...|access-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"[[reverse commute|reverse commuting]]\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to [[Western Massachusetts]] that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|1}}<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==Line description==\n[[File:Railway map around New York City.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Railway diagram of intercity services around New York City, showing Penn Station and [[Grand Central Terminal]]]]\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along [[river]]-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major [[parkway]]s closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (and a short portion that becomes the [[Taconic State Parkway]]), the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] and [[Interstate 684]]. In the last section it also begins to run close to [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]], the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"\u2013direct competition to the NY&H.

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s.

Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauchfoundation.org/files/9913/5818/7008/How_the_LIRR_Could_Shape_the_Next_Economy.pdf|title=How the Long Island Rail Road Could Shape the Next Economy|date=2013|website=rauchfoundation.org|publisher=Regional Plan Association|pages=11\u201312|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/rail-line-upgrade-boosting-ridership-article-1.559742|title=RAIL LINE UPGRADE BOOSTING RIDERSHIP|last=Egbert|first=Bill|date=July 21, 2005|work=NY Daily News|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase by the MTA===\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a [[Interest rate#Related terms|discount rate]] of 6.25%.<ref name=purchase/> The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central.
