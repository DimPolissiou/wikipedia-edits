After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask to reveal their identity. This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain, and one is declared the winner after they perform again. There is no cash prize for winning, rather, the celebrity wins the \"golden mask trophy.\"<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Natalie|title=''The Masked Singer'' Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl|url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220055111/https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|archive-date=February 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=From the Banana to the Taco, ''The Masked Singer'' Season 3 Costumes Have Been Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-costumes-first-look-photos-1203485426/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303231616/https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-costumes-first-look-photos-1203485426/|archive-date=March 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the second season, the series has also featured a \"smackdown\" round in some episodes in which the two competitors with the fewest votes from their first performances sing again with a second vote occurring, and the performer with the fewest votes is then eliminated.<ref name=\"USA Sep 24\">{{cite web|last=Keveney|first=Bill|title=''The Masked Singer'': Producers promise trickier clues, bigger names and crazier costumes|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/09/24/masked-singer-tweaks-rules-for-16-contestant-season-2/2424261001/|website=[[USA Today]]|date=September 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200310055251/https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/09/24/masked-singer-tweaks-rules-for-16-contestant-season-2/2424261001/|archive-date=March 10, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In the third season, the contestants were divided into three subgroups who performed on three consecutive episodes before returning to the unified performance format afterwards.<ref name=\"BB Jan 31\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/8549443/masked-singer-showrunner-season-3-changes-surprises-interview|title=''Masked Singer'' Showrunner Promises Big Changes for Season 3, Says Cast is \"Unbelievably Interesting\"|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207084115/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/8549443/masked-singer-showrunner-season-3-changes-surprises-interview|archive-date=February 7, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show and are referred to as a \"clue package\" by the panelists.

Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by his agent, Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. He then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night to schedule a meeting with him the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.<ref name=\"TVF Apr 2019\"/> According to Plestis, Wade was \"scared\" by the show but envisioned its potential.

Rather than follow the South Korean version in which two singers perform in three rounds, with the winner of the final round facing the winner of the previous episode in an attempt to become the new \"Mask King,\" Ibarra opted to air one elimination per night, emphasize the clue packages and guessing component, and have the celebrities wear more extravagant costumes.<ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> The series was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the series. As a result, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]]  was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by Fox's parent company [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]) due to Plestis' relationship with the studio. For the [[The Masked Singer (American season 2)|second season]], production transitioned to a new in-house studio, Fox Alternative Entertainment, and the show's budget was lowered as a result.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Dade|title=''The Masked Singer'' Renewed For Third Season, Gets Post-Super Bowl Slot On|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-masked-singer-season-3-to-premiere-after-super-bowl-liv-on-fox-1202613462/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=May 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830010304/https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-masked-singer-season-3-to-premiere-after-super-bowl-liv-on-fox-1202613462/|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-launching-unscripted-studio-masked-singer-1209087|title=Fox Launching Unscripted Studio With ''The Masked Singer'' (Exclusive)|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817034711/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-launching-unscripted-studio-masked-singer-1209087|archive-date=August 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wade said this gave the network further creative control over the series and allowed it to sell merchandise, launch a national tour, and create spin-off show ''The Masked Dancer''.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nExecutive producer Izzie Pick Ibarra was ecstatic when Nick Cannon agreed to host the show, citing him as her number-one choice for the role because of his personality and experience. Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke, respectively, due to their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer.<ref name=\"E!

She said many of the celebrities had emotional reactions when presented with the proposed costumes and that they were excited to use the show to reinvent their [[reputation|public image]].

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask to reveal their identity. This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain, and one is declared the winner after they perform again.

Rather than follow the South Korean version in which two singers perform in three rounds, with the winner of the final round facing the winner of the previous episode in an attempt to become the new \"Mask King,\" Ibarra opted to air one elimination per night, emphasize the clue packages and guessing component, and have the celebrities wear more extravagant costumes.<ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> The series was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the series. As a result, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]]  was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by Fox's parent company [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]) due to Plestis' relationship with the studio.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke, respectively, due to their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer.<ref name=\"E!
