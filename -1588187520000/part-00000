During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Formation of a Persecuting Society|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts| edition=second|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-2964-0}}</ref> Concepts of heresy firmed up in Christian thought alongside concepts of orthodoxy.  Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

They began to harass the mercenaries and pilgrims of the crusader army. A brawl ensued. Soon the attackers from the town found themselves outnumbered and they retreated back into the town in disarray. The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders.

It included the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) which began when Pope Lucius the third issued a decree through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam,'' and the Papal Inquisition, which started in the 1230s. Canon law was still developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to such a degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of the Inquisition when it seemed that Germanic law had failed.<ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse. The Third Lateran council of 1179 then became the first to legislate on it as deserving of being deprived of office or excommunicated.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}} The Fourth Lateran council reduced those penalties, but later Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to extirpate homosexuality from Germany.

For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|date=July 2001|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought from the First to the Fourth Centuries==\nChristian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|isbn=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88\u201390}}\n\n[[Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

Founded by crusaders from the Second Crusade who were converted by the Bogomils on their way home to France, they settled mostly in the Languedoc region, also sometimes called the Occitan, in the south of France.

The king was a monarch in distress.

All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

Soon the attackers from the town found themselves outnumbered and they retreated back into the town in disarray. The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison. The mercenaries began  rampaging through the streets, killing and plundering, while those citizens who could run, sought refuge in the churches and cathedrals, but there was no safety from the raging mob of mercenaries.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse.

For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

His greatest success came with the factory [[Ducati]] team.\n\nHe was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 1998 [[New Year Honours]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/carl-fogarty-on-im-a-celebrity-2014-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ex-motorbike-racer-9854506.html|title=Carl Fogarty on I'm A Celebrity 2014: Everything you need to know|date=11 November 2014}}</ref> and helped to develop the [[Petronas FP1]] racing motorcycle campaigned in the early 2000s.\n\nHe won the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

Get Me Out of Here! - BBC Newsbeat|date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==World Superbikes==\nIn {{SBK|1991}}, he raced for Neil Tuxworth's [[Honda]] UK team in World Superbikes, finishing seventh overall. The team pulled out in 1992, and Fogarty nearly found himself without a ride after a promised deal failed to materialise. He did ultimately take his first WSBK win at [[Donington Park]], and finished the championship ninth overall despite only completing a partial season.\n\nThe {{SBK|1993}} season was the beginning of his era as a factory [[Ducati]] rider. He battled with [[Scott Russell (motorcyclist)|Scott Russell]] for the title, winning 11 races to the American's five, but losing out on consistency (Russell came 2nd twelve times compared to Fogarty's two) to finish behind him.\n\nIn {{SBK|1994}}, two factors came together to build on the successes of the previous season. Fogarty was fit and hungry for the title, having been so close the previous season; but he would also be using the new Ducati 916.\n\nHe missed the [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] races with a broken wrist, but fought back to beat Russell and [[Aaron Slight]] to the crown.\n\nWinning six of the first eight races in {{SBK|1995}} helped him seal that title with 5 of the 24 races to spare, and he clinched it with three races remaining in 1999.\n\nIn {{SBK|1996}} he raced for Tuxworth again, now with Honda factory support. Despite winning four races that season on the [[Honda RVF750 RC45|RC45]], three more than team-mate Slight, and one more than Slight had managed over three seasons on the bike, Fogarty again struggled with consistency and finished fourth overall, 16 points behind second placed Slight and 38 points behind champion [[Troy Corser]].\n\nIn {{SBK|1997}} he returned to Ducati, finishing second overall to the Honda of [[John Kocinski]].\n\nThe {{SBK|1998}} season was his closest title \u2013 after a disappointing weekend at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] he lay just sixth in the standings, but fought back to overhaul Corser and Slight in the final round. This was especially notable as his team (Ducati Performance), managed by Davide Tardozzi, was in its first year of WSBK competition.\n\nFogarty was forced to retire from racing in 2000 after a racing incident at [[Phillip Island]] when he hit privateer Ducati rider Robert Ulm and crashed. He suffered multiple injuries, including a serious shoulder injury which failed to heal well-enough to allow him to race again. He was replaced in the factory Ducati team by [[Troy Bayliss]].\n\nHis first victory in any form of racing at [[Brands Hatch]] did not come until 1995. He had much greater success at [[Assen]], winning all but one race there between 1995 and {{SBK|1999}}.\n\n==Other races==\n[[File:CarlFogartyTT92CregNyBaa.jpg|right|thumb|'Foggy' on his Yamaha at [[Creg-ny-Baa]] on the [[Isle of Man]]]]\nHis Isle of Man achievements started in the mid-1980s. He won the 1985 Lightweight Newcomers event at the [[Manx Grand Prix]] and went on to win three TT races. First was the 1989 production 750 race followed by  the Formula 1 and Senior events in 1990. He made a total of 26 [[Isle of Man TT]] starts, breaking the lap record in 1992. His lap at 18 minutes, 18.8 seconds (123.61&nbsp;mph) on a Yamaha 750&nbsp;cc was not broken until seven years later by [[Jim Moodie (motorcycle racer)|Jim Moodie]] from a standing start riding a [[Honda RVF750|Honda RC45]] in 1999, taking the record to 124.45&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=3844|title=Carl Fogarty - Competitors - Isle of Man TT Official Website|website=www.iomtt.com}}</ref>\n\nEarly in his career he won the [[Formula TT|Formula One]] World Championship for bikes, which was gradually fading after the 1988 commencement of the World Superbike Championship. Fogarty won it three times, from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 it dropped below the six races required for the FIM to class it as a championship, rather than merely a cup; again, he won it.\n\nHe made several starts in [[Moto GP]], filling in for [[Pierfrancesco Chili]] on an ROC bike for a while in 1990, with a best finish of sixth at the [[1990 Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix|Swedish Grand Prix]]. He also contested the 500cc [[British motorcycle Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] several times. In [[1992 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1992]] he ran sixth before crashing on oil. In [[1993 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1993]] he qualified on the second row, and ran second early on after [[Alex Barros]], [[Mick Doohan]] and [[Kevin Schwantz]] crashed on the first lap. He was set for third when he ran out of fuel, coasting over the line in fourth behind three [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamahas]]. He was entered again in [[1994 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1994]], but withdrew pre-race \u2013 citing a hand injury but later admitting that he felt the ride was uncompetitive.\n\nIn 1992, he teamed with [[Terry Rymer]] and Michael Simul to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Other wins included [[Bol d'Or]]. They went on to win the [[FIM Endurance World Championship]] for [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]]. Thus, along with his four World Superbike Championships, he holds an aggregate of five world championship titles.\n\nRiding for Ducati, Fogarty finished second at the 1995 [[Daytona 200]] in the United States.  [[Scott Russell (motorcyclist)|Scott Russell]] crashed during the first lap of the race but was able to remount and pass Fogarty for the win. Fogarty said that the pace car regrouping following the yellow flag allowed Russell to close the gap significantly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.ama-cycle.org/forms/museum/hof/hofbiopage.asp?id%3D370 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216145312/http://home.ama-cycle.org/forms/museum/hof/hofbiopage.asp?id=370 |archivedate=16 December 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nFogarty won the [[Ulster Grand Prix]] F1 race in 1988 and then a year later he won the 'King of the Roads' senior race setting a new lap record in the process, a speed of 121.629&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/motor-sport/its-sure-to-be-fogarty-at-ulster-grand-prix-28490869.html|title=It\u2019s sure to be Fogarty at Ulster Grand Prix|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Fogarty won both superbike races at the [[North West 200]] on board a Moto Cinelli Ducati 888.

They entered with Carl's former team-mate Corser and [[James Haydon]] in 2003, but their three-cylinder [[Petronas FP1]] was never truly competitive. In 2004 they achieved two third places (one for Corser and one for [[Chris Walker (motorcycle racer)|Chris Walker]]), but in this season there was little manufacturer support in WSB. Once several manufacturers returned for 2005, they were not competitive. [[Petronas]] ended the project at the end of 2006, leaving Foggy's racing future unclear. Having tried and failed to find sponsorship for a team running customer Ducatis in 2007, in May Fogarty confirmed the team's return in 2008 as the official [[MV Agusta]] team<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/motorbikes/6613129.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fogarty team confirms 2008 return | date=2 May 2007 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> \u2013 only to later pull the plug on his team's activities and put their assets up for sale.<ref name=ATLAges>{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/motorsport/story/0,,2180787,00.html |title=Fogarty closes shop after lack of sponsor interest |accessdate=8 March 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=1 October 2007 | first=Spiro | last=James}}</ref>\n\nFogarty was never a person to stray away from controversy in the WSB paddock, and even in retirement, he frequently voices his opinion (most often in the British motorcycle newspaper [[Motor Cycle News|MCN]]) in which he often berates past rivals such as [[Troy Corser]] and [[Neil Hodgson]]. This attitude towards other racers has made him a love-or-hate personality in the motorcycling world.\n\nIn 2014, Fogarty won the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 14)|fourteenth series]] of ITV' ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''.

He also holds the second highest number of race wins at 59. He is the son of former motorcycle racer George Fogarty.<ref>[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/21135/lot/377/ Bonhams auctions, sale of ex-George Fogarty RG500] \"''Bought new from Suzuki by George Fogarty (father of Carl), this RG500 MkII was raced by him during 1977 and 1978''\" Retrieved 24 December 2014</ref>\n\nRetired from racing since 2000, Fogarty is renowned for his high corner speed riding style, combined with an aggressive competitiveness, which brought him 59 victories and four World Superbike Championships (1994, 1995, 1998 and 1999). His greatest success came with the factory [[Ducati]] team.\n\nHe was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 1998 [[New Year Honours]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/carl-fogarty-on-im-a-celebrity-2014-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ex-motorbike-racer-9854506.html|title=Carl Fogarty on I'm A Celebrity 2014: Everything you need to know|date=11 November 2014}}</ref> and helped to develop the [[Petronas FP1]] racing motorcycle campaigned in the early 2000s.\n\nHe won the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 14)|14th series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2014 and was crowned 'King of the Jungle'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/30374097/carl-fogarty-wins-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here|title=Carl Fogarty wins I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! - BBC Newsbeat|date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==World Superbikes==\nIn {{SBK|1991}}, he raced for Neil Tuxworth's [[Honda]] UK team in World Superbikes, finishing seventh overall. The team pulled out in 1992, and Fogarty nearly found himself without a ride after a promised deal failed to materialise. He did ultimately take his first WSBK win at [[Donington Park]], and finished the championship ninth overall despite only completing a partial season.\n\nThe {{SBK|1993}} season was the beginning of his era as a factory [[Ducati]] rider. He battled with [[Scott Russell (motorcyclist)|Scott Russell]] for the title, winning 11 races to the American's five, but losing out on consistency (Russell came 2nd twelve times compared to Fogarty's two) to finish behind him.\n\nIn {{SBK|1994}}, two factors came together to build on the successes of the previous season. Fogarty was fit and hungry for the title, having been so close the previous season; but he would also be using the new Ducati 916.\n\nHe missed the [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] races with a broken wrist, but fought back to beat Russell and [[Aaron Slight]] to the crown.\n\nWinning six of the first eight races in {{SBK|1995}} helped him seal that title with 5 of the 24 races to spare, and he clinched it with three races remaining in 1999.\n\nIn {{SBK|1996}} he raced for Tuxworth again, now with Honda factory support. Despite winning four races that season on the [[Honda RVF750 RC45|RC45]], three more than team-mate Slight, and one more than Slight had managed over three seasons on the bike, Fogarty again struggled with consistency and finished fourth overall, 16 points behind second placed Slight and 38 points behind champion [[Troy Corser]].\n\nIn {{SBK|1997}} he returned to Ducati, finishing second overall to the Honda of [[John Kocinski]].\n\nThe {{SBK|1998}} season was his closest title \u2013 after a disappointing weekend at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] he lay just sixth in the standings, but fought back to overhaul Corser and Slight in the final round. This was especially notable as his team (Ducati Performance), managed by Davide Tardozzi, was in its first year of WSBK competition.\n\nFogarty was forced to retire from racing in 2000 after a racing incident at [[Phillip Island]] when he hit privateer Ducati rider Robert Ulm and crashed. He suffered multiple injuries, including a serious shoulder injury which failed to heal well-enough to allow him to race again. He was replaced in the factory Ducati team by [[Troy Bayliss]].\n\nHis first victory in any form of racing at [[Brands Hatch]] did not come until 1995. He had much greater success at [[Assen]], winning all but one race there between 1995 and {{SBK|1999}}.\n\n==Other races==\n[[File:CarlFogartyTT92CregNyBaa.jpg|right|thumb|'Foggy' on his Yamaha at [[Creg-ny-Baa]] on the [[Isle of Man]]]]\nHis Isle of Man achievements started in the mid-1980s. He won the 1985 Lightweight Newcomers event at the [[Manx Grand Prix]] and went on to win three TT races. First was the 1989 production 750 race followed by  the Formula 1 and Senior events in 1990. He made a total of 26 [[Isle of Man TT]] starts, breaking the lap record in 1992. His lap at 18 minutes, 18.8 seconds (123.61&nbsp;mph) on a Yamaha 750&nbsp;cc was not broken until seven years later by [[Jim Moodie (motorcycle racer)|Jim Moodie]] from a standing start riding a [[Honda RVF750|Honda RC45]] in 1999, taking the record to 124.45&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=3844|title=Carl Fogarty - Competitors - Isle of Man TT Official Website|website=www.iomtt.com}}</ref>\n\nEarly in his career he won the [[Formula TT|Formula One]] World Championship for bikes, which was gradually fading after the 1988 commencement of the World Superbike Championship. Fogarty won it three times, from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 it dropped below the six races required for the FIM to class it as a championship, rather than merely a cup; again, he won it.\n\nHe made several starts in [[Moto GP]], filling in for [[Pierfrancesco Chili]] on an ROC bike for a while in 1990, with a best finish of sixth at the [[1990 Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix|Swedish Grand Prix]]. He also contested the 500cc [[British motorcycle Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] several times. In [[1992 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1992]] he ran sixth before crashing on oil. In [[1993 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1993]] he qualified on the second row, and ran second early on after [[Alex Barros]], [[Mick Doohan]] and [[Kevin Schwantz]] crashed on the first lap. He was set for third when he ran out of fuel, coasting over the line in fourth behind three [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamahas]]. He was entered again in [[1994 British motorcycle Grand Prix|1994]], but withdrew pre-race \u2013 citing a hand injury but later admitting that he felt the ride was uncompetitive.\n\nIn 1992, he teamed with [[Terry Rymer]] and Michael Simul to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Other wins included [[Bol d'Or]]. They went on to win the [[FIM Endurance World Championship]] for [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]]. Thus, along with his four World Superbike Championships, he holds an aggregate of five world championship titles.\n\nRiding for Ducati, Fogarty finished second at the 1995 [[Daytona 200]] in the United States.  [[Scott Russell (motorcyclist)|Scott Russell]] crashed during the first lap of the race but was able to remount and pass Fogarty for the win. Fogarty said that the pace car regrouping following the yellow flag allowed Russell to close the gap significantly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.ama-cycle.org/forms/museum/hof/hofbiopage.asp?id%3D370 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216145312/http://home.ama-cycle.org/forms/museum/hof/hofbiopage.asp?id=370 |archivedate=16 December 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nFogarty won the [[Ulster Grand Prix]] F1 race in 1988 and then a year later he won the 'King of the Roads' senior race setting a new lap record in the process, a speed of 121.629&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/motor-sport/its-sure-to-be-fogarty-at-ulster-grand-prix-28490869.html|title=It\u2019s sure to be Fogarty at Ulster Grand Prix|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Fogarty won both superbike races at the [[North West 200]] on board a Moto Cinelli Ducati 888.

They entered with Carl's former team-mate Corser and [[James Haydon]] in 2003, but their three-cylinder [[Petronas FP1]] was never truly competitive. In 2004 they achieved two third places (one for Corser and one for [[Chris Walker (motorcycle racer)|Chris Walker]]), but in this season there was little manufacturer support in WSB. Once several manufacturers returned for 2005, they were not competitive. [[Petronas]] ended the project at the end of 2006, leaving Foggy's racing future unclear. Having tried and failed to find sponsorship for a team running customer Ducatis in 2007, in May Fogarty confirmed the team's return in 2008 as the official [[MV Agusta]] team<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/motorbikes/6613129.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fogarty team confirms 2008 return | date=2 May 2007 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> \u2013 only to later pull the plug on his team's activities and put their assets up for sale.<ref name=ATLAges>{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/motorsport/story/0,,2180787,00.html |title=Fogarty closes shop after lack of sponsor interest |accessdate=8 March 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=1 October 2007 | first=Spiro | last=James}}</ref>\n\nFogarty was never a person to stray away from controversy in the WSB paddock, and even in retirement, he frequently voices his opinion (most often in the British motorcycle newspaper [[Motor Cycle News|MCN]]) in which he often berates past rivals such as [[Troy Corser]] and [[Neil Hodgson]]. This attitude towards other racers has made him a love-or-hate personality in the motorcycling world.\n\nIn 2014, Fogarty won the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 14)|fourteenth series]] of ITV' ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''.

The college is one of four educational institutions affiliated with the Salt Lake City-based [[Center for Excellence in Higher Education]] (CEHE). Established in 1891, the college has five campuses in [[Idaho]] and [[Utah]]. It offers online and on-campus programs for [[associate's degree]]s, [[bachelor's degree]]s, and [[master's degree]]s.  Although it is accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]], Stevens\u2013Henager College and all other institutions owned by the [[Center for Excellence in Higher Education]] were placed on probation in September 2018 because \"the inputs, resources, and processes of CEHE schools are designed and implemented in a manner that is not designed for student success.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accsc.org/UploadedDocuments/2018/Probation-Letters/CEHE-System-Wide-SAL-09-2018-Probation-Redacted.pdf |title=System-Wide Review Probation Order |author=[[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] |date=September 6, 2018 |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/09/11/accreditor-finds-misleading-consumer-statements-discriminatory-attitudes-profit |title=Probation for For-Profit College Chain |first=Andrew |last=Kreighbaum |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nStevens\u2013Henager, one of the oldest colleges in Utah, was opened in September 1891 by Professor James Ayers Smith, an educator from Nebraska, as the Inter-Mountain Business College, with an enrollment of seven pupils.  It began teaching commercial subjects and placed graduates in business positions. Paul Kenneth Smith, son of James Ayers Smith, began as the typewriter machinist and later served as an instructor at the college.\n\nFor about 19 years, Stevens\u2013Henager College was known as Intermountain Business College. A Biennial Catalogue for enrollment 1908-09 shows the school's name as The Smithsonian Business College and Shorthand School, 258 Twenty Fourth Street, Ogden, Utah.\n\nIn 1910, Professor J. A. Smith retired and sold the school to C. S. Springer, who changed the name to the Smithsonian Business School. In 1938, the college was purchased by Dr. David B. Moench, son of Louis F. Moench, a Utah educator and the first principal of Weber Stake Academy, which later became [[Weber State College]]. It then became known as the Moench University of Business and operated as such until 1940, when it was purchased by I. W. Stevens and renamed Ogden Business College. The name was changed to Stevens\u2013Henager College in 1959.<ref name=\"about page\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenshenager.edu/about-us|title=About Stevens-Henager College|publisher=Stevens-Henager College|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nStevens-Henager has its main campus in Ogden, Utah.

It began teaching commercial subjects and placed graduates in business positions. Paul Kenneth Smith, son of James Ayers Smith, began as the typewriter machinist and later served as an instructor at the college.\n\nFor about 19 years, Stevens\u2013Henager College was known as Intermountain Business College. A Biennial Catalogue for enrollment 1908-09 shows the school's name as The Smithsonian Business College and Shorthand School, 258 Twenty Fourth Street, Ogden, Utah.\n\nIn 1910, Professor J. A. Smith retired and sold the school to C. S. Springer, who changed the name to the Smithsonian Business School. In 1938, the college was purchased by Dr. David B. Moench, son of Louis F. Moench, a Utah educator and the first principal of Weber Stake Academy, which later became [[Weber State College]]. It then became known as the Moench University of Business and operated as such until 1940, when it was purchased by I. W. Stevens and renamed Ogden Business College. The name was changed to Stevens\u2013Henager College in 1959.<ref name=\"about page\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenshenager.edu/about-us|title=About Stevens-Henager College|publisher=Stevens-Henager College|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nStevens-Henager has its main campus in Ogden, Utah.

This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of [[subsidiarity]] requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.\n\n[[File:European Commission.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlaymont building]] in the [[Brussels and the European Union#European Quarter|European Quarter]] of [[Brussels]], Belgium, houses the headquarters of the European Commission]]\n\nThe European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]: the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Council]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n* the [[European Council]], which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.\n* the [[European Commission]], the only institution empowered to propose legislation, serves as the \"Guardian of the Treaties\". It consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].\n* the [[Council of the European Union]] brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It serves to represent the various governments directly and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.\n* the [[European Parliament]] consists of 705 directly elected representatives. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's president, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.\n* the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.\n* the [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for monetary stability within member states.\n* the [[European Court of Auditors]] investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states. As well as providing oversight and advice, it can refer unresolved issues to the European Court of Justice to arbitrate on any alleged irregularities.\n\nEU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states.

This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n* the [[European Council]], which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.\n* the [[European Commission]], the only institution empowered to propose legislation, serves as the \"Guardian of the Treaties\". It consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].\n* the [[Council of the European Union]] brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It serves to represent the various governments directly and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.\n* the [[European Parliament]] consists of 705 directly elected representatives. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's president, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.\n* the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.\n* the [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for monetary stability within member states.\n* the [[European Court of Auditors]] investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states.

{"title_page": "Magic string", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Magic number (programming)|Magic string (therapeutic aid)}}\n\nIn [[computer programming]], a '''magic string''' is an input that a programmer believes will never come externally and which activates otherwise hidden functionality. A user of this program would likely provide input that gives an expected response in most situations. However, if the user does in fact innocently provide the pre-defined input, invoking the internal functionality, the program response is often quite unexpected to the user (thus appearing \"magical\").<ref name=\"CFalter1\">{{Citation\n | title = A Good Solution for Magic String Data | author = Chris Falter | url = http://www.eggheadcafe.com/tutorials/aspnet/b916e3a9-d056-4669-8bf3-aa98ed6669c3/a-good-solution-for-magi.aspx | publisher = \"Egghead Cafe Tuturiols\" at [http://www.eggheadcafe.com/ Egghead Cafe] | date = 2008-03-06 | accessdate = 2009-05-11}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nTypically, the implementation of magic strings is due to time constraints. A developer must find a fast solution instead of delving more deeply into a problem and finding a better solution.\n\nFor example, when testing a program that takes a user's personal details and verifies their credit card number, a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of \"***\" as a credit card number would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card were valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter \"***\" as a placeholder credit card number while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.\n\n== Resolution ==\n\n=== Situations/issues of cause ===\n\nOften there are significant time constraints out of the developer's control right from the beginning of their involvement in a project. Common issues that might lead to this anti-pattern as a result:\n\n* Null != null<ref name=\"FNaude\">{{Citation\n | title = NULL | author = Frank Naude | url = http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/NULL | publisher = \"Oracle Wiki\" at [http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/ Oracle Wiki] | date = 2008-12-06 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref><ref name=\"WLam\">{{Citation\n | title = The Behavior of NULL's in SQL | author = Wang Lam | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/fcdb/oracle/or-nulls.html | publisher = \"Stanford University\" at [http://infolab.stanford.edu/ Stanford InfoLab] | date = 2003-05-21 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref> or any variation where a [[data type]] doesn't compare bitwise to a supposedly identical type. This is an issue that can even occur within the same development environment (same programming language and compiler). This problem has a long history for numerical and boolean types and most compilers handle this well (with applicable warnings and errors, default resolution, etc...). [[Nullable]] types such as strings have the difficulty of historically different definitions for [[Null character|NULL]]. The errors/warnings produced are often general or a 'best fit' default error whose message does not actually describe what's going on. If the developer can't get enough clues to track the issue down through debugging, taking a short cut, and coding in a 'default' string, may be the only way to keep the project on schedule. One solution to this may be the application of the [[Null Object pattern]].<ref name=\"Freeman\">Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates; 2004, ''Head First Design Patterns'', 1st ed., O'Reilly, Chapter 6, pg. 214, ''The Command Pattern'', {{ISBN|0-596-00712-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-596-00712-6}}</ref>\n* Programmed into a corner. Sometimes a design seems straightforward and even simple but turns out to have a logical flaw, dependent upon the possible user inputs, due to an often unforeseen circumstance towards the end of planned development. Thus a developer might feel the need to implement a user input with special security/operational allowances to deal with such circumstances. This can be particularly ironic since it will sometimes become obvious that a more robust design from the beginning would likely have left room to handle the flaw. However this would perhaps have taken too much time to implement and it might  have conflicted with the fundamental engineering concept of [[KISS principle|KISS]], keeping a design and implementation simple and meeting only the initial necessary requirements.\n* Allowing external access to a [[Global variable|global]] flag.<ref name=\"JMcCaffrey\">{{Citation\n | title = Test Automation for ASP.NET Web Apps with SSL | author = James McCaffrey | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163943.aspx | publisher = \"Microsoft\" at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/ MSDN] | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref> Over-confidence that a global flag can never be set accidentally or maliciously (often a quite reasonable assumption) justifies such implementation for testing and debug purposes, especially for small applications with simple interfaces. If the distribution of the program is considerable however, it is usually just a matter of time before somebody sets the flag. An obvious solution is to never use a global variable in such a manner. A developer might also make the flag ''circumstantially'' accessible. So the magic string by itself would be dealt with by the program as any other input.<ref name=\"ACumming\">Andrew Cumming; 2007, ''SQL Hacks'', 1st ed., O'Reilly, pg. 174, ''Prevent an SQL Injection Attack'', {{ISBN|0-596-52799-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-596-52799-0}}</ref> The user has to then reproduce the setting as well as produce some collection of other events, that the user interface discreetly allows, for the flag to accept the setting; a far more unlikely scenario, though still possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Strict formatting ===\n\nRestricting the format of the input is a possible maintenance (bug fixing) solution.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  Essentially, this means validating input information to check that it is in the correct format, in order to reduce the possibility of the magic string being discovered by the user.  Examples include validating a telephone number to ensure that it contains only digits (and possibly spaces and punctuation to a limited extent) or checking that a person's name has a forename and a surname (and is appropriately capitalised).  An exception is made for the magic string in the validation code so that it will not be rejected by validation. It is expected that, since a user would likely quickly notice the strict enforcement of formatting, it would likely not occur to the user to try inputting a string not conforming to the format. Therefore, it is very unlikely for the user to try the magic string.\n\nAs with any input validation process, it is important to ensure that the format is not restrictive in a way that unintentionally restricts the use of the application by some users. An example of this is restricting [[telephone number]] or [[postal code]]<ref name=\"BKnight\">Brian Knight, Allan Mitchell, Darren Green, Douglas Hinson, Kathi Kellenberger; 2005, ''Professional SQL server 2005 integration services'', 1st ed., John Wiley and Sons, Chapter 5, pg. 129, ''Handling Dirty Data'', {{ISBN|0-7645-8435-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7645-8435-0}}</ref> input based on one country's system (e.g. requiring every user to give a five-digit [[ZIP code]]), causing problems for legitimate users who are based in other countries.\n\n== Purposeful implementation ==\nAs is often the case with anti-patterns, there exists specific scenarios where magic strings are a correct solution for an implementation.

However, if the user does in fact innocently provide the pre-defined input, invoking the internal functionality, the program response is often quite unexpected to the user (thus appearing \"magical\").<ref name=\"CFalter1\">{{Citation\n | title = A Good Solution for Magic String Data | author = Chris Falter | url = http://www.eggheadcafe.com/tutorials/aspnet/b916e3a9-d056-4669-8bf3-aa98ed6669c3/a-good-solution-for-magi.aspx | publisher = \"Egghead Cafe Tuturiols\" at [http://www.eggheadcafe.com/ Egghead Cafe] | date = 2008-03-06 | accessdate = 2009-05-11}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nTypically, the implementation of magic strings is due to time constraints. A developer must find a fast solution instead of delving more deeply into a problem and finding a better solution.\n\nFor example, when testing a program that takes a user's personal details and verifies their credit card number, a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of \"***\" as a credit card number would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card were valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter \"***\" as a placeholder credit card number while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.\n\n== Resolution ==\n\n=== Situations/issues of cause ===\n\nOften there are significant time constraints out of the developer's control right from the beginning of their involvement in a project. Common issues that might lead to this anti-pattern as a result:\n\n* Null != null<ref name=\"FNaude\">{{Citation\n | title = NULL | author = Frank Naude | url = http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/NULL | publisher = \"Oracle Wiki\" at [http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/ Oracle Wiki] | date = 2008-12-06 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref><ref name=\"WLam\">{{Citation\n | title = The Behavior of NULL's in SQL | author = Wang Lam | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/fcdb/oracle/or-nulls.html | publisher = \"Stanford University\" at [http://infolab.stanford.edu/ Stanford InfoLab] | date = 2003-05-21 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref> or any variation where a [[data type]] doesn't compare bitwise to a supposedly identical type. This is an issue that can even occur within the same development environment (same programming language and compiler). This problem has a long history for numerical and boolean types and most compilers handle this well (with applicable warnings and errors, default resolution, etc...). [[Nullable]] types such as strings have the difficulty of historically different definitions for [[Null character|NULL]]. The errors/warnings produced are often general or a 'best fit' default error whose message does not actually describe what's going on. If the developer can't get enough clues to track the issue down through debugging, taking a short cut, and coding in a 'default' string, may be the only way to keep the project on schedule. One solution to this may be the application of the [[Null Object pattern]].<ref name=\"Freeman\">Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates; 2004, ''Head First Design Patterns'', 1st ed., O'Reilly, Chapter 6, pg. 214, ''The Command Pattern'', {{ISBN|0-596-00712-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-596-00712-6}}</ref>\n* Programmed into a corner. Sometimes a design seems straightforward and even simple but turns out to have a logical flaw, dependent upon the possible user inputs, due to an often unforeseen circumstance towards the end of planned development. Thus a developer might feel the need to implement a user input with special security/operational allowances to deal with such circumstances. This can be particularly ironic since it will sometimes become obvious that a more robust design from the beginning would likely have left room to handle the flaw. However this would perhaps have taken too much time to implement and it might  have conflicted with the fundamental engineering concept of [[KISS principle|KISS]], keeping a design and implementation simple and meeting only the initial necessary requirements.\n* Allowing external access to a [[Global variable|global]] flag.<ref name=\"JMcCaffrey\">{{Citation\n | title = Test Automation for ASP.NET Web Apps with SSL | author = James McCaffrey | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163943.aspx | publisher = \"Microsoft\" at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/ MSDN] | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-13}}</ref> Over-confidence that a global flag can never be set accidentally or maliciously (often a quite reasonable assumption) justifies such implementation for testing and debug purposes, especially for small applications with simple interfaces. If the distribution of the program is considerable however, it is usually just a matter of time before somebody sets the flag. An obvious solution is to never use a global variable in such a manner. A developer might also make the flag ''circumstantially'' accessible. So the magic string by itself would be dealt with by the program as any other input.<ref name=\"ACumming\">Andrew Cumming; 2007, ''SQL Hacks'', 1st ed., O'Reilly, pg. 174, ''Prevent an SQL Injection Attack'', {{ISBN|0-596-52799-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-596-52799-0}}</ref> The user has to then reproduce the setting as well as produce some collection of other events, that the user interface discreetly allows, for the flag to accept the setting; a far more unlikely scenario, though still possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Strict formatting ===\n\nRestricting the format of the input is a possible maintenance (bug fixing) solution.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  Essentially, this means validating input information to check that it is in the correct format, in order to reduce the possibility of the magic string being discovered by the user.  Examples include validating a telephone number to ensure that it contains only digits (and possibly spaces and punctuation to a limited extent) or checking that a person's name has a forename and a surname (and is appropriately capitalised).  An exception is made for the magic string in the validation code so that it will not be rejected by validation. It is expected that, since a user would likely quickly notice the strict enforcement of formatting, it would likely not occur to the user to try inputting a string not conforming to the format. Therefore, it is very unlikely for the user to try the magic string.\n\nAs with any input validation process, it is important to ensure that the format is not restrictive in a way that unintentionally restricts the use of the application by some users. An example of this is restricting [[telephone number]] or [[postal code]]<ref name=\"BKnight\">Brian Knight, Allan Mitchell, Darren Green, Douglas Hinson, Kathi Kellenberger; 2005, ''Professional SQL server 2005 integration services'', 1st ed., John Wiley and Sons, Chapter 5, pg. 129, ''Handling Dirty Data'', {{ISBN|0-7645-8435-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7645-8435-0}}</ref> input based on one country's system (e.g. requiring every user to give a five-digit [[ZIP code]]), causing problems for legitimate users who are based in other countries.\n\n== Purposeful implementation ==\nAs is often the case with anti-patterns, there exists specific scenarios where magic strings are a correct solution for an implementation.
