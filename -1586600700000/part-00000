The [[tsar]]s were educated as officers, and they regularly wore military uniforms and held military rank. [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]] in his later years in power frequently wore a [[military uniform]], and he assumed the title [[Generalissimo of the Soviet Union]]. Likewise, Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] was named [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. By tradition dating back to the tsars, the Minister of Defense was a uniformed officer,' with military background ([[Dmitry Milyutin]], [[Rodion Malinovsky]]) or without ([[Dmitriy Ustinov]]). The [[State Duma]] also seats a large number of [[member of parliament|deputies]] who are active-duty military officers\u2014another tradition that began in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian imperial era]]. These combinations of military and civilian authority ensure that military concerns are considered at the highest levels of the Russian government.}}\n\n===Russian Federation===\nIn May 1992, [[President of Russia]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed [[Army General (Soviet Union)|General of the Army]] [[Pavel Grachev]] to the post of Minister of Defence. Grachev's decision to side with Yeltsin in the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], when the president called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]] to blast his opponents out of parliament, effectively deprived the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] of its nominal an opportunity to overturn the president's authority. At least partly for that reason, Yeltsin retained his defence minister despite intense criticism of Grachev's management of the [[First Chechen War]] and the Russian military establishment in general. Finally, Yeltsin's victory in the first round of the [[History of post-Soviet Russia#The 1996 presidential election|1996 Russian presidential election]] spurred Yeltsin to dismiss Grachev.\n\nIn March 2001, [[Sergei Ivanov]], previously secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]] was appointed defence minister by President [[Vladimir Putin]], becoming Russia's first non-uniformed civilian defence minister.<ref>Peter Finn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html Russian Leader Expands Powers of a Possible Successor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018114031/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html |date=2017-10-18 }}, [[Washington Post]], 16 February 2007.</ref>\nPutin called the personnel changes in Russia's security structures coinciding with Ivanov's appointment as defence minister \"a step toward demilitarizing public life.\" Putin also stressed Ivanov's responsibility for overseeing military reform as defence minister. What Putin did not emphasise was Ivanov's long service within the [[KGB]] and [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] and his then rank of General-Lieutenant within the FSB. Such military and security agency associated men are known as [[siloviki]].\n\nAs of 2002 there were four living [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshals of the Soviet Union]]. Such men are automatically Advisors to the Defence Minister. The Marshals alive at that time were [[Viktor Kulikov]], [[Vasily Ivanovich Petrov|Vasily Petrov]], [[Sergei Sokolov (Marshal)|Sergei Sokolov]], a former Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union, and [[Dmitri Yazov]]. Yazov was listed by the American analysts Scott and Scott in 2002 as a consultant to the (former 10th) Directorate for International Military Cooperation<ref>Harriet F. Scott and William Scott, Russian Military Directory 2002, p. 341, citing DS2002-0802.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the first 'real' non-uniformed Defence Minister was [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]], appointed in February 2007. Serdyukov was a former Tax Minister with little [[siloviki]] or military associations beyond his two years' military service.\n\n==Structure==\nThe Ministry of Defence is managed by a collegium chaired by the Defence Minister and including the deputy Defence Ministers, heads of Main Defence Ministry and General Staff Directorates, and the commanders of the Joint Strategic Commands/Military Districts, the three Services, and three branches, who together form the principal staff and advisory board of the Minister of Defence.\n\nThe executive body of the Ministry of Defence is the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]]. It is commanded by the [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of General Staff]]. U.S. expert [[William Odom]] said in 1998 that 'the Soviet General Staff without the MoD is conceivable, but the MoD without the General Staff is not.'<ref>[[William Eldridge Odom]], 'The Collapse of the Soviet Military,' Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-08271-1}}, p. 27.</ref> Russian General Staff officers exercise command authority in their own right.

The [[tsar]]s were educated as officers, and they regularly wore military uniforms and held military rank. [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]] in his later years in power frequently wore a [[military uniform]], and he assumed the title [[Generalissimo of the Soviet Union]]. Likewise, Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] was named [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. By tradition dating back to the tsars, the Minister of Defense was a uniformed officer,' with military background ([[Dmitry Milyutin]], [[Rodion Malinovsky]]) or without ([[Dmitriy Ustinov]]). The [[State Duma]] also seats a large number of [[member of parliament|deputies]] who are active-duty military officers\u2014another tradition that began in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian imperial era]]. These combinations of military and civilian authority ensure that military concerns are considered at the highest levels of the Russian government.}}\n\n===Russian Federation===\nIn May 1992, [[President of Russia]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed [[Army General (Soviet Union)|General of the Army]] [[Pavel Grachev]] to the post of Minister of Defence. Grachev's decision to side with Yeltsin in the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], when the president called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]] to blast his opponents out of parliament, effectively deprived the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] of its nominal an opportunity to overturn the president's authority. At least partly for that reason, Yeltsin retained his defence minister despite intense criticism of Grachev's management of the [[First Chechen War]] and the Russian military establishment in general. Finally, Yeltsin's victory in the first round of the [[History of post-Soviet Russia#The 1996 presidential election|1996 Russian presidential election]] spurred Yeltsin to dismiss Grachev.\n\nIn March 2001, [[Sergei Ivanov]], previously secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]] was appointed defence minister by President [[Vladimir Putin]], becoming Russia's first non-uniformed civilian defence minister.<ref>Peter Finn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html Russian Leader Expands Powers of a Possible Successor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018114031/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html |date=2017-10-18 }}, [[Washington Post]], 16 February 2007.</ref>\nPutin called the personnel changes in Russia's security structures coinciding with Ivanov's appointment as defence minister \"a step toward demilitarizing public life.\" Putin also stressed Ivanov's responsibility for overseeing military reform as defence minister.

It is commanded by the [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of General Staff]]. U.S. expert [[William Odom]] said in 1998 that 'the Soviet General Staff without the MoD is conceivable, but the MoD without the General Staff is not.'<ref>[[William Eldridge Odom]], 'The Collapse of the Soviet Military,' Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-08271-1}}, p. 27.</ref> Russian General Staff officers exercise command authority in their own right. In 1996 the General Staff included fifteen main directorates and an undetermined number of operating agencies. The staff is organized by functions, with each directorate and operating agency overseeing a functional area, generally indicated by the organization's title.\n\n''Military Thought'' is the military-theoretical journal of the Ministry of Defence, and [[Krasnaya Zvezda]] its daily newspaper.\n\n===Structure in 2019===\nSenior staff in 2019 included:<ref name=\"RF MOD\">RF MOD website www.mil.ru accessed 18 August 2019.</ref>\n\n'''Minister of Defence:'''\n* '''Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation''' \u2013 [[General of the Army (Russia)|General of the Army]] [[Sergei Shoigu]] (since 6 November 2012)\n\n'''First Deputy Minister(s) of Defence:'''\n* '''Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation \u2013 First Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation''' \u2013 General of the Army [[Valery Gerasimov]] (since 9 November 2012)\n* '''First Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation''' \u2013 Active State Advisor of the Russian Federation, 1st Class [[Ruslan Tsalikov]] (since 24 December 2015)\n\n'''Deputy Minister(s) of Defence:'''\n* '''State Secretary \u2013 Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation''' \u2013 General of the Army (Retired) [[Nikolay Pankov]] (since 13 September 2005)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for Organising Material-Technical Support for the Armed Forces)''' \u2013 General of the Army [[Dmitry Bulgakov]] (since 27 July 2010)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for Organising Financial Support for the Armed Forces)''' \u2013 Active State Advisor of the Russian Federation, 1st Class [[Tatiana Shevtsova]] (since 4 August 2010)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation \u2013 Supervisor of the Apparatus of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation''' \u2013 [[Colonel General]] [[Yuriy Sadovenko]] (since 7 January 2013)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for the Development of the Technical Basis for the Management System and Information Technology)''' \u2013 General of the Army [[Pavel Popov]] (since 7 November 2013)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for Organising Property Management, Quartering of Troops (Forces), Housing, and Medical Support for the Armed Forces)''' \u2013 Active State Advisor of the Russian Federation, 2nd Class [[Timur Ivanov]] (since 23 May 2016)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for Organising International Military and Military-Technical Cooperation)''' \u2013 Colonel General [[Alexander Fomin]] (since 31 January 2017)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation (Responsible for Organising Military-Technical Support for the Armed Forces)''' \u2013 [[Aleksey Krivoruchko]] (since 13 June 2018)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation \u2013 Chief of the Main Directorate for Political-Military Affairs of the Russian Armed Forces''' \u2013 Colonel General [[Andrey Kartapolov]] (since 30 July 2018)\n* '''Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation''' - Lieutenant General [[Yunus-Bek Yevkurov]] (since 8 July 2019)\n\n<br />\nEntities directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence in August 2012 included:<ref name=\"RF MOD\"/>\n{{col-begin}}\n* MOD Press Service and Information Directorate\n* MOD Physical Training Directorate\n* MOD Financial Auditing Inspectorate\n* MOD [[Main Military Medical Directorate]]\n* MOD State Order Placement Department \n* MOD Property Relations Department\n* Expert Center of the MOD Staff\n* MOD Administration Directorate\n* MOD State Defence Order Facilitation Department\n* MOD Department of the State Customer for Capital Construction\n* MOD State Architectural-Construction Oversight Department\n* MOD Sanatoria-resort Support Department\n* MOD Housekeeping Directorate\n{{col-break}}\n* MOD State Review/Study Group\n* MOD Educational Department\n* MOD Legal Department\n* MOD Organizational-inspection Department\n* MOD Personnel Inspectorate\n* MOD Military Inspectorate\n* MOD State Technical Oversight Directorate\n* MOD Aviation Flight Safety Service\n* MOD Nuclear and Radiation Safety Oversight Directorate\n* MOD Autotransport Directorate\n* MOD Staff Protocol Department\n* MOD Armed Force Weapons Turnover Oversight Service\n* MOD [[Military Police (Russia)|Main Military Police Directorate]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Outline structure 2004===\nAn outline structure of the Ministry of Defence includes the groupings below, but this structure was in transition when it was recorded in 2004, with several deputy minister posts being abolished:<ref>H.F.

He was a member of the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] and the first monarch since King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] to have actually been born into the [[Danish royal family]]; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]]. Among his siblings was King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. \n\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], in which he dismissed the democratically elected [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|Social Liberal]] cabinet with which he disagreed, and instated one of his own choosing. This was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of [[parliamentarianism]] had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901. Faced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic [[head of state]].\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], Christian become a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. With a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times.\n\n==Early life==\nChristian was born on 26 September 1870 at [[Charlottenlund Palace]] in [[Gentofte Municipality]] north of [[Copenhagen]], during the reign of his paternal grandfather, [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]]. He was born as the oldest son and child of [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Sweden]], only surviving child of [[Charles XV of Sweden|King Charles XV of Sweden]]. He was baptised in the Chapel of [[Christiansborg Palace]] on 31 October 1870 by the [[Diocese of Zealand|Bishop of Zealand]], [[Hans Lassen Martensen]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allerh. approb.

She eventually became his [[queen consort]]. They had two sons:\n\n* Prince Frederick (1899\u20131972), later King [[Frederick IX of Denmark]]\n* Prince Knud (1900\u20131976), later [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark]]\n\nThe couple were given Christian VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen as their residence and [[Sorgenfri Palace]] north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received [[Marselisborg Palace]] in [[Aarhus]] as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the [[villa]] [[Klitg\u00e5rden]] in [[Skagen]].\n\n===Crown Prince===\nOn 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died, and Christian's father ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII. Christian himself became crown prince.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n===Accession===\n[[File:King Christian X talking to the people on his accession 1912.jpg|thumb|Christian X addressing the people when he acceded the throne|alt=]]\n\nOn 14 May 1912, [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII]] died after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking a walk in a park in [[Hamburg]], Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in [[Nice]], France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to [[Copenhagen]]. Christian was in [[Copenhagen]] when he heard about his father's demise and acceded to the throne as Christian X.\n\n===Easter Crisis of 1920===\n{{Main|Easter Crisis of 1920}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00617A, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Christian X..jpg|thumb|King Christian and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] during a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1913|alt=]]\n\nIn April 1920, Christian instigated the Easter Crisis, perhaps the most decisive event in the evolution of the Danish monarchy in the Twentieth Century. The immediate cause was a conflict between the King and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of [[Schleswig]], a former Danish [[fiefdom]], which had been lost to [[Prussia]] during the [[Second War of Schleswig]]. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of [[World War I]], at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two [[plebiscite]]s: one in Northern Schleswig (Denmark's [[South Jutland County]] 1971\u20132006), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times, remained part of the post-war German state.\n\nIn Northern Schleswig, seventy-five percent voted for reunification with Denmark and twenty-five percent for remaining with Germany. In this vote, the entire region was considered to be an indivisible unit, and the entire region was awarded to Denmark. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with eighty percent voting for Germany and twenty percent for Denmark. In this vote, each municipality decided its own future, and German majorities prevailed everywhere. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control.\n\nMany Danish nationalists felt that at least the city of [[Flensburg]], in Central Schleswig, should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a [[parliamentary democracy]] since the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]] in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.\n\nSubsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the cabinet and replaced it with a de facto conservative caretaker cabinet. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the King and members of the [[Social Democrats]]. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year. \n\nTo date, this is the last time a sitting Danish monarch has attempted to take political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian X bowed fully to his drastically reduced status, and spent the last quarter-century of his rule as a model constitutional monarch.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Christian X.jpg|thumb|upright|During the German [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], the King's daily ride through Copenhagen became a symbol of Danish sovereignty.

Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position. Its territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German [[panzer]]s; [[Jutland]], for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] immediately to the south. Unlike its Nordic neighbours, Denmark had no mountain ranges from which a drawn-out resistance could be mounted against the German army.<ref name=\"RiseFall\">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990), p. 663.</ref>  With no prospect of being able to hold out for any length of time, and faced with the explicit threat of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing the civilian population of [[Copenhagen]], and with only one general in favour of continuing to fight, Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at about 6&nbsp;am,<ref>[[Peter Rochegune Munch]]: Erindringer 7, p. 29.</ref> in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters,<ref>[http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html The German occupation of Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015025325/http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html |date=15 October 2013 }}</ref> beginning the [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], which lasted until 5 May 1945.\n\nIn contrast to his brother, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]], and [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], [[George II of Greece|King George II of Greece]], [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]], [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II of Yugoslavia]], [[Edvard Bene\u0161|President Edvard Bene\u0161 of Czechoslovakia]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz|President W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz of Poland]], all of whom went into [[exile]] during the Nazi occupation of their countries, Christian X (like [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]]) remained in his capital throughout the [[occupation of Denmark]], being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause (Haakon escaped the German advance after [[Haakon VII of Norway#Resistance during World War II|refusing to accept a Nazi-friendly puppet regime]].)\n\n[[File:Kongem\u00e6rker.jpg|thumb|Two versions of the King's Emblem Pin (''Kongem\u00e6rket''), showing Christian's CX [[royal cypher|cypher]]; a popular symbol of patriotism during the war|alt=]]\n\nUntil the [[Occupation of Denmark#Increasing resistance|imposition of martial law]] by Germany in August 1943, Christian's official speeches reflected the government's official policy of cooperation with the occupying forces, but this did not prevent his being seen by the Danish people as a man of \"mental resistance.\" During the first two years of the German occupation, in spite of his age and the precarious situation, he nonetheless took a daily ride on his horse, Jubilee, through Copenhagen, unaccompanied by a groom, let alone by a guard. A popular way for Danes to display patriotism and silent resistance to the German occupation was wearing a small square button with the Danish flag and the crowned insignia of the king.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/historien-bag-konge-emblemet|title=The History Behind the King's Emblem|author1=Danish Royal Family|date=27 November 2012|website=Kongehuset.dk/|publisher=The Danish Royal Family|language=Danish|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> This symbol was called the ''Kongem\u00e6rket'' (''King's Emblem pin'').

This perceived slight, known as the [[Telegram Crisis]], greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat [[Erik Scavenius]], whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative. (In any event, whatever independence Denmark had been able to maintain during the first years of the occupation ended abruptly with the German ''Putsch'' in August 1943.) After a fall with his horse on 19 October 1942, he was more or less an invalid for the rest of his reign.<ref>[http://www.faktalink.dk/publish.php?linknavn=besahele FaktaLink \u2013 2005 \u2013 Bes\u00e6ttelsen \u2013 Kilder<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610015309/http://www.faktalink.dk/publish.php?linknavn=besahele |date=10 June 2007 }}</ref> The role he played in creating the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]] greatly reduced his popularity, but his daily rides, the Telegram Crisis, and the admiring stories spread by [[Danish-American]] circles had once again made him popular to the point of being a beloved national symbol.\n\n===Reign over Iceland===\n[[File:DENMARK'S KING CHRISTIAN MARKS 75TH BIRTHDAY.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1:10|1945 newsreel about King Christian's 75th birthday]]The accession of a new [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] in late 1918 redefined [[Iceland]], a longtime part of the [[Danish realm]], as a sovereign state in a [[personal union]] with the King of Denmark. This made Christian the king of the mostly autonomous [[Kingdom of Iceland]] in addition to being King of Denmark. Christian (whose name in Iceland was officially ''Kristj\u00e1n X'') was the first and only monarch to ever reign over Iceland as a sovereign kingdom as opposed to ruling it as a province of a larger kingdom. In 1941, after the German occupation of Denmark and the [[Occupation of Iceland|Allied occupation of Iceland]], the Icelandic government concluded that Christian was unable to perform his duties as head of state of Iceland, and thus appointed [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]] as [[regent]] to act as provisional head of state. Sveinn had previously been Iceland's ambassador in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1944, while Denmark was still under German occupation, Icelanders voted in a plebiscite to sever all ties with the King of Denmark and to found a [[republic]]. Thus, Christian's title as King of Iceland became null and void and Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson was elected the first [[President of Iceland]] by the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. Christian, who believed that Sveinn had given him assurances that Iceland would not make further moves toward independence while the occupation was ongoing, felt quite badly betrayed. However, at the urging of his relative, the King of Sweden, Christian still accepted the outcome and sent a message of congratulations to Iceland during the celebration of the founding of the Republic on 17 June 1944. The reading of the King's letter provoked cheers at [[\u00deingvellir]] during the celebration. Despite this implicit acceptance of Iceland's independence, Christian never actually stopped using the title \"King of Iceland\", and continued including it in his regnal name until his death in 1947.\n\n===Death===\nOn his death in [[Amalienborg Palace]], Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was [[interred]] along other members of the Danish royal family in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the [[Danish resistance movement]] was placed on his coffin at ''[[castrum doloris]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022617/http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>[http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx Official website of the Danish Monarchy \u2013 Biography of King Christian X] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125000024/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx |date=25 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Legends==\nOn 22 November 1942, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a photograph of Christian X; calling him, facetiously, a victim of [[Hitler]], and stating that the nation of this monarch did not oppose German occupation with arms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vilhj\u00e1lmsson|first1=Vilhj\u00e1lmur \u00d6rn|editor1-last=Bastholm Jensen|editor1-first=Mette|editor2-last=Jensen|editor2-first=Steven B.|title=Denmark and the Holocaust|journal=In: Bastholm Jensen, Mette & Steven B.

The boy reportedly replied, \"All of Denmark is his bodyguard.\" This story was recounted in [[Nathaniel Benchley]]'s bestselling book ''Bright Candles'' as well as in [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''[[Number the Stars]]''. The contemporary patriotic song ''\"Der rider en Konge\"''<!--contemporary Danish spelling--> (''There Rides a King'') centers on the King's rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner's inquiry about the King's lack of a guard that \"he is our freest man\" and that the King is not shielded by physical force but that \"hearts guard the king of Denmark.\"<ref>\"Der rider en Konge\".

The King riding by and seeing the flag, tells a German sentry that this is a violation of the armistice agreement and that the flag must be taken down. The sentry replies that this will not be done. The King then says if the flag is not taken down, he will send a Danish soldier to take it down. The sentry responds, \"The soldier will be shot.\" The King replies \"the Danish soldier will be me.\" According to the story, the flag was taken down.\n\nKing Christian X became the hero of a number of myths about his defense of the Danish Jews. He became the subject of a persistent [[urban legend]] according to which, during [[Nazi]] occupation, he donned the [[Star of David]] in solidarity with the Danish Jews. Danish Jews were not forced to wear the [[Star of David]]. However, the legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularised when it was included in [[Leon Uris]]'s best-selling novel, ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.<ref>[http://www.b.dk/nationalt/islandsk-forsker-christian-x-red-aldrig-med-joede-armbind Islandsk forsker: Christian X red aldrig med j\u00f8de-armbind \u2013 Nationalt | www.b.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is also supported by the King's personal diary, where the following entry can be found: \"When you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution.

26 September 1870&nbsp;\u2013 20 April 1947) was [[List of Danish monarchs|King of Denmark]] from 1912 to 1947, and the only [[King of Iceland]] (where the name was officially '''Kristj\u00e1n X''') between 1918 and 1944. He was a member of the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] and the first monarch since King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] to have actually been born into the [[Danish royal family]]; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]]. Among his siblings was King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. \n\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], in which he dismissed the democratically elected [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|Social Liberal]] cabinet with which he disagreed, and instated one of his own choosing. This was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of [[parliamentarianism]] had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901. Faced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic [[head of state]].\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], Christian become a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. With a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times.\n\n==Early life==\nChristian was born on 26 September 1870 at [[Charlottenlund Palace]] in [[Gentofte Municipality]] north of [[Copenhagen]], during the reign of his paternal grandfather, [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]]. He was born as the oldest son and child of [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Sweden]], only surviving child of [[Charles XV of Sweden|King Charles XV of Sweden]]. He was baptised in the Chapel of [[Christiansborg Palace]] on 31 October 1870 by the [[Diocese of Zealand|Bishop of Zealand]], [[Hans Lassen Martensen]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allerh. approb.

She eventually became his [[queen consort]]. They had two sons:\n\n* Prince Frederick (1899\u20131972), later King [[Frederick IX of Denmark]]\n* Prince Knud (1900\u20131976), later [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark]]\n\nThe couple were given Christian VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen as their residence and [[Sorgenfri Palace]] north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received [[Marselisborg Palace]] in [[Aarhus]] as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the [[villa]] [[Klitg\u00e5rden]] in [[Skagen]].\n\n===Crown Prince===\nOn 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died, and Christian's father ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII. Christian himself became crown prince.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n===Accession===\n[[File:King Christian X talking to the people on his accession 1912.jpg|thumb|Christian X addressing the people when he acceded the throne|alt=]]\n\nOn 14 May 1912, [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII]] died after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking a walk in a park in [[Hamburg]], Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in [[Nice]], France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to [[Copenhagen]]. Christian was in [[Copenhagen]] when he heard about his father's demise and acceded to the throne as Christian X.\n\n===Easter Crisis of 1920===\n{{Main|Easter Crisis of 1920}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00617A, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Christian X..jpg|thumb|King Christian and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] during a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1913|alt=]]\n\nIn April 1920, Christian instigated the Easter Crisis, perhaps the most decisive event in the evolution of the Danish monarchy in the Twentieth Century. The immediate cause was a conflict between the King and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of [[Schleswig]], a former Danish [[fiefdom]], which had been lost to [[Prussia]] during the [[Second War of Schleswig]]. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of [[World War I]], at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two [[plebiscite]]s: one in Northern Schleswig (Denmark's [[South Jutland County]] 1971\u20132006), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times, remained part of the post-war German state.\n\nIn Northern Schleswig, seventy-five percent voted for reunification with Denmark and twenty-five percent for remaining with Germany. In this vote, the entire region was considered to be an indivisible unit, and the entire region was awarded to Denmark. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with eighty percent voting for Germany and twenty percent for Denmark. In this vote, each municipality decided its own future, and German majorities prevailed everywhere. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control.\n\nMany Danish nationalists felt that at least the city of [[Flensburg]], in Central Schleswig, should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a [[parliamentary democracy]] since the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]] in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.\n\nSubsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the cabinet and replaced it with a de facto conservative caretaker cabinet. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the King and members of the [[Social Democrats]]. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year. \n\nTo date, this is the last time a sitting Danish monarch has attempted to take political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian X bowed fully to his drastically reduced status, and spent the last quarter-century of his rule as a model constitutional monarch.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Christian X.jpg|thumb|upright|During the German [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], the King's daily ride through Copenhagen became a symbol of Danish sovereignty. This picture was taken on his birthday in 1940|alt=|left]]\n\nAt 4 a.m. on 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invaded Denmark in a surprise attack]], overwhelming Denmark's Army and Navy and destroying the Danish Army Air Corps. Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position. Its territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German [[panzer]]s; [[Jutland]], for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] immediately to the south. Unlike its Nordic neighbours, Denmark had no mountain ranges from which a drawn-out resistance could be mounted against the German army.<ref name=\"RiseFall\">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990), p. 663.</ref>  With no prospect of being able to hold out for any length of time, and faced with the explicit threat of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing the civilian population of [[Copenhagen]], and with only one general in favour of continuing to fight, Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at about 6&nbsp;am,<ref>[[Peter Rochegune Munch]]: Erindringer 7, p. 29.</ref> in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters,<ref>[http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html The German occupation of Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015025325/http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html |date=15 October 2013 }}</ref> beginning the [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], which lasted until 5 May 1945.\n\nIn contrast to his brother, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]], and [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], [[George II of Greece|King George II of Greece]], [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]], [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II of Yugoslavia]], [[Edvard Bene\u0161|President Edvard Bene\u0161 of Czechoslovakia]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz|President W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz of Poland]], all of whom went into [[exile]] during the Nazi occupation of their countries, Christian X (like [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]]) remained in his capital throughout the [[occupation of Denmark]], being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause (Haakon escaped the German advance after [[Haakon VII of Norway#Resistance during World War II|refusing to accept a Nazi-friendly puppet regime]].)\n\n[[File:Kongem\u00e6rker.jpg|thumb|Two versions of the King's Emblem Pin (''Kongem\u00e6rket''), showing Christian's CX [[royal cypher|cypher]]; a popular symbol of patriotism during the war|alt=]]\n\nUntil the [[Occupation of Denmark#Increasing resistance|imposition of martial law]] by Germany in August 1943, Christian's official speeches reflected the government's official policy of cooperation with the occupying forces, but this did not prevent his being seen by the Danish people as a man of \"mental resistance.\" During the first two years of the German occupation, in spite of his age and the precarious situation, he nonetheless took a daily ride on his horse, Jubilee, through Copenhagen, unaccompanied by a groom, let alone by a guard.

This perceived slight, known as the [[Telegram Crisis]], greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat [[Erik Scavenius]], whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative. (In any event, whatever independence Denmark had been able to maintain during the first years of the occupation ended abruptly with the German ''putsch'' in August 1943.) After a fall with his horse on 19 October 1942, he was more or less an invalid for the rest of his reign.<ref>[http://www.faktalink.dk/publish.php?linknavn=besahele FaktaLink \u2013 2005 \u2013 Bes\u00e6ttelsen \u2013 Kilder<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610015309/http://www.faktalink.dk/publish.php?linknavn=besahele |date=10 June 2007 }}</ref> The role he played in creating the Easter Crisis of 1920 greatly reduced his popularity, but his daily rides, the Telegram Crisis, and the admiring stories spread by [[Danish-American]] circles had once again made him popular to the point of being a beloved national symbol.\n\n===Reign over Iceland===\n[[File:DENMARK'S KING CHRISTIAN MARKS 75TH BIRTHDAY.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1:10|1945 newsreel about King Christian's 75th birthday]]The accession of a new [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] in late 1918 redefined [[Iceland]], a longtime part of the [[Danish realm]], as a sovereign state in a [[personal union]] with the King of Denmark. This made Christian the king of the mostly autonomous [[Kingdom of Iceland]] in addition to being King of Denmark. Christian (whose name in Iceland was officially ''Kristj\u00e1n X'') was the first and only monarch to ever reign over Iceland as a sovereign kingdom as opposed to ruling it as a province of a larger kingdom. In 1941, after the German occupation of Denmark and the [[Occupation of Iceland|Allied occupation of Iceland]], the Icelandic government concluded that Christian was unable to perform his duties as head of state of Iceland, and thus appointed [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]] as [[regent]] to act as provisional head of state. Sveinn had previously been Iceland's ambassador in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1944, while Denmark was still under German occupation, Icelanders voted in a plebiscite to sever all ties with the King of Denmark and to found a [[republic]]. Thus, Christian's title as King of Iceland became null and void and Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson was elected the first [[President of Iceland]] by the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. Christian, who believed that Sveinn had given him assurances that Iceland would not make further moves toward independence while the occupation was ongoing, felt quite badly betrayed. However, at the urging of his relative, the King of Sweden, Christian still accepted the outcome and sent a message of congratulations to Iceland during the celebration of the founding of the Republic on 17 June 1944. The reading of the King's letter provoked cheers at [[\u00deingvellir]] during the celebration. Despite this implicit acceptance of Iceland's independence, Christian never actually stopped using the title \"King of Iceland\", and continued including it in his regnal name until his death in 1947.\n\n===Death===\nOn his death in [[Amalienborg Palace]], Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was [[interred]] along other members of the Danish royal family in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the [[Danish resistance movement]] was placed on his coffin at ''[[castrum doloris]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022617/http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>[http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx Official website of the Danish Monarchy \u2013 Biography of King Christian X] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125000024/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx |date=25 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Legends==\nOn 22 November 1942, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a photograph of Christian X; calling him, facetiously, a victim of [[Hitler]], and stating that the nation of this monarch did not oppose German occupation with arms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vilhj\u00e1lmsson|first1=Vilhj\u00e1lmur \u00d6rn|editor1-last=Bastholm Jensen|editor1-first=Mette|editor2-last=Jensen|editor2-first=Steven B.|title=Denmark and the Holocaust|journal=In: Bastholm Jensen, Mette & Steven B.

One apocryphal story relates that one day, a German soldier remarked to a young boy that he found it odd that the King would ride with no bodyguard. The boy reportedly replied, \"All of Denmark is his bodyguard.\" This story was recounted in [[Nathaniel Benchley]]'s bestselling book ''Bright Candles'' as well as in [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''[[Number the Stars]]''. The contemporary patriotic song ''\"Der rider en Konge\"''<!--contemporary Danish spelling--> (''There Rides a King'') centers on the King's rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner's inquiry about the King's lack of a guard that \"he is our freest man\" and that the King is not shielded by physical force but that \"hearts guard the king of Denmark.\"<ref>\"Der rider en Konge\".

The King riding by and seeing the flag, tells a German sentry that this is a violation of the armistice agreement and that the flag must be taken down. The sentry replies that this will not be done. The King then says if the flag is not taken down, he will send a Danish soldier to take it down. The sentry responds, \"The soldier will be shot.\" The King replies \"the Danish soldier will be me.\" According to the story, the flag was taken down.\n\nKing Christian X became the hero of a number of myths about his defense of the Danish Jews. He became the subject of a persistent [[urban legend]] according to which, during [[Nazi]] occupation, he donned the [[Star of David]] in solidarity with the Danish Jews. Danish Jews were not forced to wear the [[Star of David]]. However, the legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularised when it was included in [[Leon Uris]]'s best-selling novel, ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.<ref>[http://www.b.dk/nationalt/islandsk-forsker-christian-x-red-aldrig-med-joede-armbind Islandsk forsker: Christian X red aldrig med j\u00f8de-armbind \u2013 Nationalt | www.b.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is also supported by the King's personal diary, where the following entry can be found: \"When you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution.

Certain stories are individually \"owned\" by a group, and in some cases dances, body decoration and symbols in a ceremony pass on these stories only within the group, so it is vital that these ceremonies are remembered and performed correctly. Men and women have different roles, and are sometimes appointed as guardians of a sacred site, whose role it is to care for the site and the spiritual beings who live there, achieved partly by performing ceremonies. The terms \u201cmen\u2019s business\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s business\u201d are sometimes used; neither have greater spiritual needs or responsibilities than the other, but jointly ensure that sacred practices are passed on. Men often conduct ceremonies, but women are also guardians of special knowledge, hold great spiritual power within a group, and conduct ceremonies. Participation in ceremonies can also be restricted by age, family group, language group, but are sometimes open to all, depending on the purpose of the ceremony.<ref name=resource8/>\n\nRight of access to songs and dances pertaining to a specific ceremony belong to a certain defined group; some may be shared with people outside the community, but some are never shared. There is a wide range of songs, dances, music, body ornamentation, costume, and symbolism, designed to connect the body with the spiritual world of the ancestors.

In parts of Northern Australia, there are two stages of burial. After the body has been on an elevated platform, covered with leaves and branches, long enough for the flesh to rot away from the bones, the bones are collected, painted with [[ochre]], and dispersed in various ways.<ref name=style/>\n*A [[corroboree]] is a ceremonial meeting for Australian Aboriginal people, interacting with the Dreaming and accompanied by song and dance.

This \"fire-stick farming\", or \"burning off\", reduces the fuel-load for a potential major bush fire, while fertilising the ground and increasing the number of young plants, providing additional food for [[kangaroo]]s and other fauna hunted for meat.
