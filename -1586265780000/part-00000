Cruise Control, Side Assist, Lane Assist and Park Assist. The Arteon will notice if a driver has not touched the accelerator, brakes or steering wheel for a certain length of time, and it will attempt to alert the person with sounds, visual cues and even a physical brake tap.\n\nIf that does not work, Emergency Assist 2.0 takes over: the car's hazard lights switch on and it steers itself to a safe nearside lane. The system uses Lane Assist to recognize lines on the road and Park Assist to actually steer the car. Radar detection via Adaptive Cruise Control and Side Assist helps ensure the Arteon will not hit any other vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/09/vw-arteon-self-driving-tech-pass-out-emergency-assist/|title=How VW's Arteon keeps you alive if you pass out while driving|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}\nChina commenced production on the Arteon under the ''CC'' name starting in August 2018, for the model year of 2019.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Europe===\n9,798 Arteons were sold in Europe in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carsalesbase.com/european-car-sales-data/volkswagen/volkswagen-arteon/|title=Volkswagen Arteon European sales figures|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n====United States====\nThe Arteon made its United States debut at the [[Chicago Auto Show#2018|2018 Chicago Auto Show]].

Cruise Control, Side Assist, Lane Assist and Park Assist. The Arteon will notice if a driver has not touched the accelerator, brakes or steering wheel for a certain length of time, and it will attempt to alert the person with sounds, visual cues and even a physical brake tap.\n\nIf that does not work, Emergency Assist 2.0 takes over: the car's hazard lights switch on and it steers itself to a safe nearside lane. The system uses Lane Assist to recognize lines on the road and Park Assist to actually steer the car. Radar detection via Adaptive Cruise Control and Side Assist helps ensure the Arteon will not hit any other vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/09/vw-arteon-self-driving-tech-pass-out-emergency-assist/|title=How VW's Arteon keeps you alive if you pass out while driving|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}\nChina commenced production on the Arteon under the ''CC'' name starting in August 2018, for the model year of 2019.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Europe===\n9,798 Arteons were sold in Europe in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carsalesbase.com/european-car-sales-data/volkswagen/volkswagen-arteon/|title=Volkswagen Arteon European sales figures|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n====United States====\nThe Arteon made its United States debut at the [[Chicago Auto Show#2018|2018 Chicago Auto Show]].

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands.

In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up.

When they signed to [[Geffen Records]] in 1986, the band comprised vocalist [[Axl Rose]], lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]]. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist [[Dizzy Reed]], guitarist [[Richard Fortus]], drummer [[Frank Ferrer]] and keyboardist [[Melissa Reese]].\n\nGuns N' Roses' debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] a year after its release, on the strength of the Top 10 singles \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", \"[[Paradise City]]\", and \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\", the band's only single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|eleventh-bestselling album]]. Their next studio album, ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' (1988), reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the Top 5 hit \"[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]\". ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]],'' recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The ''Illusion'' albums included the lead single \"[[You Could Be Mine]]\" (also featured in the film soundtrack for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''), covers of \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\" and \"[[Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door]]\", and a trilogy of ballads (\"[[Don't Cry]]\", \"[[November Rain]]\", and \"[[Estranged (song)|Estranged]]\"), which featured [[List of most expensive music videos|notably high-budget music videos]]. The ''Illusion'' records were also supported by the extensive [[Use Your Illusion Tour]], a world tour that lasted from 1991-1993. ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'' (1993), an album of covers, was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.\n\nWork on a follow up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the ''Illusion''-era lineup. After a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (2008), was released. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200, but undersold industry expectations despite mostly positive critical reception. Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which became the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|third-highest-grossing concert tour on record]], grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.\n\nIn their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world.\" The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer [[Matt Sorum]], was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, its first year of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them the [[List of best-selling music artists|41st-bestselling artist in history]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1985\u20131986)===\n{{main|Hollywood Rose|L.A.

When they signed to [[Geffen Records]] in 1986, the band comprised vocalist [[Axl Rose]], lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]]. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist [[Dizzy Reed]], guitarist [[Richard Fortus]], drummer [[Frank Ferrer]] and keyboardist [[Melissa Reese]].\n\nGuns N' Roses' debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] a year after its release, on the strength of the Top 10 singles \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", \"[[Paradise City]]\", and \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\", the band's only single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|eleventh-bestselling album]]. Their next studio album, ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' (1988), reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the Top 5 hit \"[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]\". ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]],'' recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The ''Illusion'' albums included the lead single \"[[You Could Be Mine]]\" (also featured in the film soundtrack for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''), covers of \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\" and \"[[Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door]]\", and a trilogy of ballads (\"[[Don't Cry]]\", \"[[November Rain]]\", and \"[[Estranged (song)|Estranged]]\"), which featured [[List of most expensive music videos|notably high-budget music videos]]. The ''Illusion'' records were also supported by the extensive [[Use Your Illusion Tour]], a world tour that lasted from 1991-1993. ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'' (1993), an album of covers, was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.\n\nWork on a follow up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the ''Illusion''-era lineup. After a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (2008), was released. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200, but undersold industry expectations despite mostly positive critical reception. Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which became the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|third-highest-grossing concert tour on record]], grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.\n\nIn their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world.\" The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer [[Matt Sorum]], was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, its first year of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them the [[List of best-selling music artists|41st-bestselling artist in history]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1985\u20131986)===\n{{main|Hollywood Rose|L.A.

{"title_page": "Richard Michael Levey", "text_new": "'''Richard Michael Levey''' (actual surname: O'Shaughnessy; mostly known as '''R. M. Levey''') (25 October 1811 \u2013 28 June 1899) was an Irish violinist, conductor, composer, and teacher. He was one of a handful of noted musicians who kept Dublin's concert life in the nineteenth century alive under difficult economic circumstances.\n\n==Life==\nLevey was born in [[County Meath]], the actual place name is not established. Levey's original surname was O'Shaughnessy, but according to one of his most prominent pupils, the composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], he changed it \"for what he considered to be a more musical one\".<ref>C. V. Stanford: ''Pages from an Unwritten Diary'' (London, 1914), p.&nbsp;34; see Bibliography.</ref> Levey was his mother's maiden name.<ref>Ita Beausang: \"Levey family\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin, 2013), p.&nbsp;587.</ref> The name was officially adopted, and all of his legitimate children and the following generations were called Levey (according to several sources, Levey had 20 children from three women).<ref>Derek Collins: \"Levey\", in: ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'' (MGG), biographical part, vol.&nbsp;11 (Kassel: B\u00e4renreiter, 2004), c.&nbsp;31.</ref>\n\nHe received tuition on the violin in Dublin by James Barton (c.1785\u2013c.1850) and became a member of the orchestra of the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]] in 1826, aged 15, succeeding Barton as concert master there in 1834. From 1834 until the destruction of the edifice by fire in 1880 he was also the musical director of the Theatre Royal, a role that involved conducting the orchestra, composing more than 100 overtures to plays, and directing operatic performances including vocal soloists, a chorus and the orchestra. He was also leader of the orchestras of the Antient Concerts Society and the Philharmonic Society as well as secretary of the Dublin Madrigal Society and the Irish Musical Fund. According to Beausang (2013), \"he was omnipresent for over 50 years at public concerts in Dublin by local and visiting musicians\".<ref>Beausang (2013), p.&nbsp;588.</ref> On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his association with the Theatre Royal, he was presented on stage with a \"testimonial\" from the Duke of Leinster and the Earl of Charlemont and a benefit performance.<ref>Beausang (2013), p.&nbsp;588.</ref>\n\nStill a young man, Levey played in the orchestra during [[Angelica Catalani]]'s tour of Ireland in 1829 and the visit to Dublin of [[Michael William Balfe]]'s opera company in 1839.<ref>Collins (2004), c.&nbsp;31.</ref> Levey also conducted the Irish premiere of Balfe's ''[[The Maid of Artois]]'' In 1840. Balfe, who had also studied with James Barton, remained a life-long friend of Levey's.<ref>Beausang (2013), p.&nbsp;588.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Levey was a prominent violin teacher in Dublin. In 1848, he was a co-founder of the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] and was its professor of violin from its foundation until 1897.<ref>Collins (2004), c.&nbsp;31.</ref> In 1852, he formed a class for advanced students there modelled on the methods of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]] in Paris and the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Academy of Music in Leipzig]].<ref>''The Freeman's Journal'', 4 May 1852, quoted in Beausang (2013), p.&nbsp;588.</ref> His most prominent pupils were [[Robert Prescott Stewart]] and Charles V. Stanford.\n\nLevey was also a keen expert on Irish traditional music. He presented public lectures, played the violin in lectures by others, and published a collection of more than 100 dance tunes in 1858. Following reprints in 1965 and 2003, this is still in use today.\n\nAmong Levey's acknowledged children was the birth of triplets in April 1837, two of whom became prominent musicians: the violin virtuoso Richard Michael Levey junior (1837\u20131911) who stylised himself as a \"Paganini Redivivus\" (the reborn Paganini) and the operatic composer and conductor [[William Charles Levey]] (1837\u20131894). His great-grandson, [[Michael Levey]] (1927\u20132008), was director the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986, and author of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' (1971).<ref>See review by [[Charles Rosen]] in ''The New York Review of Books'', 18 May 1972, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/18/love-that-mozart/ here]; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref>\n\nLevey lived to see the opening the new Theatre Royal in December 1897 and died in Dublin in 1899, aged 88.\n\n==Assessment==\nAlong with [[John William Glover]], [[Joseph Robinson (composer)|Joseph Robinson]] and his brothers, John Stanford (the father of [[Charles Villiers Stanford|C. V. Stanford]]), and [[Robert Prescott Stewart]], Levey was part of a group of committed individuals who kept Dublin musical life going during economically difficult times.\n\nA contemporary source described Levey as \"an accomplished instrumentalist, a skilful composer, a firm but considerate director, an agreeable companion and a respected citizen\".<ref>(anonymous) ''The History of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1870), p.&nbsp;70.</ref> C. V. Stanford characterised him as \"a great character, with a face which might have been the model for the typical Irishman of the comic papers. He was a rough player but an admirable leader of an orchestra [\u2026]\".<ref>Stanford (1914), p.&nbsp;34.</ref>\n\nAlthough his incidental music for orchestra does not seem to have survived, Levey's published music for piano, voice and ensembles is characterised by an assured technique and a light and humorous style. Most of Levey's extant compositions are [[quadrille]]s on topical and entertaining subjects of the day. They were published in piano arrangements for home use, but were in most cases publicly performed in band arrangements; some appear to derive from his music to comedies and plays at the Theatre Royal.\n\nTogether with John O'Rorke, Levey authored ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1880), which is an important source on the history of 19th-century Irish music and drama, written mostly in calendarial form.\n\n==Selected works==\nBecause not all dates can be established, works below are listed in alphabetical order (\"n.d.\" = not dated).\n\n===Piano music===\n* ''Ali Baba, or The Forty Thieves Galop'' (London, 1873)\n* ''Arrah-na-Pogue, or The Wicklow Wedding Quadrille'' (London: Metzler & Co., n.d.)\n* ''Forty Thieves Quadrilles'' (Dublin: Cramer & Co., c.1870)\n* ''Kerry.

In 1848, he was a co-founder of the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] and was its professor of violin from its foundation until 1897.<ref>Collins (2004), c.&nbsp;31.</ref> In 1852, he formed a class for advanced students there modelled on the methods of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]] in Paris and the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Academy of Music in Leipzig]].<ref>''The Freeman's Journal'', 4 May 1852, quoted in Beausang (2013), p.&nbsp;588.</ref> His most prominent pupils were [[Robert Prescott Stewart]] and Charles V. Stanford.\n\nLevey was also a keen expert on Irish traditional music. He presented public lectures, played the violin in lectures by others, and published a collection of more than 100 dance tunes in 1858. Following reprints in 1965 and 2003, this is still in use today.\n\nAmong Levey's acknowledged children was the birth of triplets in April 1837, two of whom became prominent musicians: the violin virtuoso Richard Michael Levey junior (1837\u20131911) who stylised himself as a \"Paganini Redivivus\" (the reborn Paganini) and the operatic composer and conductor [[William Charles Levey]] (1837\u20131894). His great-grandson, [[Michael Levey]] (1927\u20132008), was director the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986, and author of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' (1971).<ref>See review by [[Charles Rosen]] in ''The New York Review of Books'', 18 May 1972, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/18/love-that-mozart/ here]; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref>\n\nLevey lived to see the opening the new Theatre Royal in December 1897 and died in Dublin in 1899, aged 88.\n\n==Assessment==\nAlong with [[John William Glover]], [[Joseph Robinson (composer)|Joseph Robinson]] and his brothers, John Stanford (the father of [[Charles Villiers Stanford|C. V. Stanford]]), and [[Robert Prescott Stewart]], Levey was part of a group of committed individuals who kept Dublin musical life going during economically difficult times.\n\nA contemporary source described Levey as \"an accomplished instrumentalist, a skilful composer, a firm but considerate director, an agreeable companion and a respected citizen\".<ref>(anonymous) ''The History of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1870), p.&nbsp;70.</ref> C. V. Stanford characterised him as \"a great character, with a face which might have been the model for the typical Irishman of the comic papers. He was a rough player but an admirable leader of an orchestra [\u2026]\".<ref>Stanford (1914), p.&nbsp;34.</ref>\n\nAlthough his incidental music for orchestra does not seem to have survived, Levey's published music for piano, voice and ensembles is characterised by an assured technique and a light and humorous style. Most of Levey's extant compositions are [[quadrille]]s on topical and entertaining subjects of the day. They were published in piano arrangements for home use, but were in most cases publicly performed in band arrangements; some appear to derive from his music to comedies and plays at the Theatre Royal.\n\nTogether with John O'Rorke, Levey authored ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1880), which is an important source on the history of 19th-century Irish music and drama, written mostly in calendarial form.\n\n==Selected works==\nBecause not all dates can be established, works below are listed in alphabetical order (\"n.d.\" = not dated).\n\n===Piano music==\n* ''Ali Baba, or The Forty Thieves Galop'' (London, 1873)\n* ''Arrah-na-Pogue, or The Wicklow Wedding Quadrille'' (London: Metzler & Co., n.d.)\n* ''Forty Thieves Quadrilles'' (Dublin: Cramer & Co., c.1870)\n* ''Kerry.
