[[Clyde Stacy]]<ref>http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/clyde_stacy.htm</ref> was one of the first, if not the first, Tulsa sound musicians to score a nationally charted record, \"Hoy Hoy b/w So Young\". This was actually a double-sided hit released by [[Candlelight Records]]  in 1957. Don Wallace, a popular Tulsa disc jockey, was instrumental in landing the recording contract for Clyde Stacy. Members of the NiteCaps during that period were John D. Levan, Rick Eilerts, and Bill Torbett.  John D. Levan was one of the first Tulsa lead guitarists having played for both Clyde Stacy in 1955, and Gene Crose 1956, then again with Stacy in 1957.
