(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12\u201317|NIV}}</ref>}}\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12\u201317|NIV}}</ref>}}\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

This split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, this results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u20137, 203\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways too, compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's RP features of a [[trap\u2013bath split|''trap\u2013bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects do not participate in [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England.\n\n===Innovative phonology===\nOn the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n* [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. This ''father\u2013bother'' vowel merger<!--Link already present two sentences prior.--> is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], as well as variably in some [[New York accent]]s.<ref name=Wells>{{harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u201337, 203\u20136, 234, 245\u201347, 339\u201340, 400, 419, 443, 576}}</ref><!-- Wells 1982: 245\u201347 --><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=171}}</ref>\n*[[cot\u2013caught merger|''Cot\u2013caught'' merger]] in transition: There is no single American way to pronounce the vowels in words like ''cot'' {{IPA|/\u0251/}} (the ''ah'' vowel) versus ''caught'' {{IPA|/\u0254/}} (the ''aw'' vowel), largely due to a merger occurring between the two sounds in some parts of North America, but not others. American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/\u0251/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|\u00e4|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[\u0251\u031f]}}, while {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|\u0252|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|\u0254|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two, thus producing a ''cot\u2013caught'' merger, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the U.S., most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midland]]s lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger. According to a 2003 dialect survey carried out across the United States, about 61% of participants perceive themselves as keeping the two vowels distinct and 39% do not.<ref>Vaux, Bert; Golder, Scott (2003). \"[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_28.html Do you pronounce 'cot' and '\u00e7aught' the same?]\" The Harvard Dialect Survey.

(This innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottal stopping]] also may occur in British English, as well as variably between vowels.)\n* [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} becomes a [[alveolar flap|flap]] {{IPAblink|\u027e|audio=y}} when occurring both (1) after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and (2) before an unstressed vowel or a syllabic consonant other than {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}, including ''water'' {{IPA-all|\u02c8w\u0254\u027e\u025a||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u0251\u0279\u027ei]}} and ''model'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251\u027e\u026b\u0329]}}. This results in pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' being pronounced the same. Flapping of {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} before a full stressed vowel is also possible, but only when that vowel begins a new word or morpheme, as in ''what is it?'' {{IPA|[w\u028c\u027e\u02c8\u026az\u026a\u0294]}} and twice in ''not at all'' {{IPA|[n\u0251\u027e\u0259\u027e\u02c8\u0254\u026b]}}.

Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319.</ref>\n* [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|Weak-vowel merger]]: The vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, so ''effect'' is pronounced like ''affect'' and ''abbot'' and ''rabbit'' rhyme. The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably, though it is typically closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} when before a consonant; otherwise it is closer to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}}\n* Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant or not, so that in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}} but in ''writer'' it is raised to {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, \u03b8, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of \"secondary school\" is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u026asku\u026b]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of \"a tall school\" would be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02ccha\u026a\u02c8sku\u026b]}}. This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: \"where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North\"</ref> and is becoming more common across the nation.\n**Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}</ref>\n* Conditioned [[/\u00e6/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region, though nationwide most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of \"continuum\" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are indeed entirely separate (or \"split\") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0l\u00e6n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0le\u0259n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}}. These are called Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth when compared to the backed Standard British \"[[broad a|broad ''a'']]\", though the two nation's ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically if not phonetically; a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.\n* [[Mergers of /\u0252r-/ and /\u0254\u02d0r-/|\"Short ''o''\" before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/\u0252r/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[o\u0279~\u0254\u0279]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/\u0254r/\u2013/o\u028ar/}} ([[horse\u2013hoarse merger|''horse''\u2013''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}\n{{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254r/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}}\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\n* [[Horse\u2013hoarse merger|''Horse\u2013hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.

Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' (\"autumn\"), ''[[faucet]]'' (\"tap\"), ''[[diaper]]'' (\"nappy\"; itself unused in the U.S.), ''[[candy]]'' (\"sweets\"), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'', and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \"fall of the leaf\" and \"fall of the year.\"<ref>{{OEtymD|fall}}</ref> ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be largely an Americanism.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W.

Some of these, for example, ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain.

The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\n\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly''; different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly \"British\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''<!--when it means \"to be a student\"-->); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology.\"<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language,\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).<ref>Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.</ref> AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called \"[[comma splice]]s\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark (\"like this\") over single ('as here').<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html\n |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks\n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association\n |year=2011\n |format=blog\n |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nVocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas fall is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (United Kingdom) vs. antenna, biscuit (United Kingdom) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (United Kingdom) vs. parking lot, caravan (United Kingdom) vs. trailer, city centre (United Kingdom) vs. downtown, flat (United Kingdom) vs. apartment, fringe (United Kingdom) vs. bangs, and holiday (United Kingdom) vs. vacation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/british-american-english.html|title=British vs. American English \u2013 Vocabulary Differences|website=www.studyenglishtoday.net|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either {{IPA|[sk]}} or {{IPA|[\u0283]}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties== <!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] -->\n{{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps].

As of the twentieth century, the middle and eastern [[Great Lakes area]], Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the [[fronting (phonetics)|front]]ing of the {{sc2|LOT}} {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel in the mouth toward {{IPA|[a]}} and [[tenseness|tensing]] of the {{sc2|TRAP}} {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} vowel wholesale to {{IPA|[e\u0259]}}.

Boston, [[Western Pennsylvania English|Pittsburgh]], [[North-Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Western American English|Western U.S. accents]] have fully completed a merger of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel with the {{Sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel ({{IPA|/\u0251/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, respectively):<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=60}}</ref> a [[cot\u2013caught merger|''cot\u2013caught'' merger]], which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country.

Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}}</ref> Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 137, 141\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]].<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\">Hayes, 2013, p. 51.</ref> Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a \"country\" accent,<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\"/> and is defined by the {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]]: {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a \"[[Southern drawl]]\" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 125\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}</ref> The fronting of the vowels of {{sc2|GOOSE}}, {{sc2|GOAT}}, {{sc2|MOUTH}}, and {{sc2|STRUT}} tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the \"[[Midland American English|Midland]]\": a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South.

Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal \"short ''a''\" tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].{{NoteTag|Dialects are considered \"[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]\" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever \"dropping\" this sound. The [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPA|/\u0252/}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[\u0251~\u00e4]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the \"short ''a''\" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[m\u00e6d]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[m\u025b\u0259n]}}.}} General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.\n\n===Other varieties===\nAlthough no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}.</ref> [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and \"[[Yinglish]]\" are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

This split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, this results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u20137, 203\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways too, compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's RP features of a [[trap\u2013bath split|''trap\u2013bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects do not participate in [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England.\n\n===Innovative phonology===\nOn the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n* [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. This ''father\u2013bother'' vowel merger<!--Link already present two sentences prior.--> is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English.

American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/\u0251/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|\u00e4|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[\u0251\u031f]}}, while {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|\u0252|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|\u0254|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two, thus producing a ''cot\u2013caught'' merger, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the U.S., most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midland]]s lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger.

(This innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottal stopping]] also may occur in British English, as well as variably between vowels.)\n* [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} becomes a [[alveolar flap|flap]] {{IPAblink|\u027e|audio=y}} when occurring both (1) after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and (2) before an unstressed vowel or a syllabic consonant other than {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}, including ''water'' {{IPA-all|\u02c8w\u0254\u027e\u025a||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u0251\u0279\u027ei]}} and ''model'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251\u027e\u026b\u0329]}}.

The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably, though it is typically closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} when before a consonant; otherwise it is closer to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}}\n* Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant or not, so that in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}} but in ''writer'' it is raised to {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, \u03b8, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of \"secondary school\" is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u026asku\u026b]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of \"a tall school\" would be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02ccha\u026a\u02c8sku\u026b]}}. This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: \"where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North\"</ref> and is becoming more common across the nation.\n**Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}</ref>\n* Conditioned [[/\u00e6/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region, though nationwide most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of \"continuum\" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are indeed entirely separate (or \"split\") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0l\u00e6n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0le\u0259n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}}. These are called Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth when compared to the backed Standard British \"[[broad a|broad ''a'']]\", though the two nation's ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically if not phonetically; a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.\n* [[Mergers of /\u0252r-/ and /\u0254\u02d0r-/|\"Short ''o''\" before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/\u0252r/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[o\u0279~\u0254\u0279]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/\u0254r/\u2013/o\u028ar/}} ([[horse\u2013hoarse merger|''horse''\u2013''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}\n{{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254r/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}}\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\n* [[Horse\u2013hoarse merger|''Horse\u2013hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.

The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\n\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly''; different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly \"British\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''<!--when it means \"to be a student\"-->); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology.\"<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language,\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).<ref>Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.</ref> AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called \"[[comma splice]]s\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark (\"like this\") over single ('as here').<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html\n |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks\n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association\n |year=2011\n |format=blog\n |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nVocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas fall is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (United Kingdom) vs. antenna, biscuit (United Kingdom) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (United Kingdom) vs. parking lot, caravan (United Kingdom) vs. trailer, city centre (United Kingdom) vs. downtown, flat (United Kingdom) vs. apartment, fringe (United Kingdom) vs. bangs, and holiday (United Kingdom) vs. vacation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/british-american-english.html|title=British vs. American English \u2013 Vocabulary Differences|website=www.studyenglishtoday.net|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either {{IPA|[sk]}} or {{IPA|[\u0283]}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties== <!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] -->\n{{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps].

Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}}</ref> Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 137, 141\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]].<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\">Hayes, 2013, p. 51.</ref> Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a \"country\" accent,<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\"/> and is defined by the {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]]: {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a \"[[Southern drawl]]\" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 125\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}</ref> The fronting of the vowels of {{sc2|GOOSE}}, {{sc2|GOAT}}, {{sc2|MOUTH}}, and {{sc2|STRUT}} tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the \"[[Midland American English|Midland]]\": a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South.

Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal \"short ''a''\" tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].<ref group=note>Dialects are considered \"[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]\" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever \"dropping\" this sound. The [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPA|/\u0252/}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[\u0251~\u00e4]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the \"short ''a''\" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[m\u00e6d]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[m\u025b\u0259n]}}.</ref> General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.\n\n===Other varieties===\nAlthough no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}.</ref> [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and \"[[Yinglish]]\" are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.
