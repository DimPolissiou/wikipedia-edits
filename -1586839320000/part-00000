Born in the [[United States]] to Japanese parents, record producer [[Teruzane Utada|Utada Teruzane]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[enka]]}} singer [[Keiko Fuji]], Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to [[Tokyo]] as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]] was signed and, under the stage name '''Cubic U''', Utada released her English-language debut album ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut ''[[First Love (Utada Hikaru album)|First Love]]'' was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \"[[Automatic (Utada Hikaru song)|Automatic]]\", \"[[Time Will Tell (Utada Hikaru song)|Time Will Tell]]\", and \"[[Movin' On Without You]]\", the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the [[Oricon]] charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. ''First Love'' eventually became the country's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] of all time.\n\nHer following album ''[[Distance (Utada Hikaru album)|Distance]]'' was released in early 2001 and spawned Utada's biggest hit singles\u2014\"[[Addicted to You (Utada Hikaru song)|Addicted to You]]\", \"[[Wait & See (Risk)]]\" and \"[[Can You Keep a Secret?

The album was commercially successful and broke several sales records after three million copies were sold in its first week of availability in Japan, instantly becoming the country's [[Lists of fastest-selling albums#Japan|fastest-selling album]]. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as \"[[Traveling (song)|Traveling]]\", \"[[Hikari (Utada Hikaru song)|Hikari]]\" and \"[[Sakura Drops]]\", ''[[Deep River (Utada Hikaru album)|Deep River]]'', which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and went on to become one of Japan's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|top-selling records]] of all-time. Subsequent full-length releases\u2014''[[Exodus (Utada Hikaru album)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Ultra Blue]]'' and ''[[Heart Station]]''\u2014achieved million-selling status certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released acoustic-driven ''[[Fant\u00f4me (album)|Fant\u00f4me]]'' and ''[[Hatsukoi (Utada Hikaru album)|Hatsukoi]]'', which reached number-one on the [[Oricon]] album charts.\n\nBy the end of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by ''[[The Japan Times]]''.

Born in the [[United States]] to Japanese parents, record producer [[Teruzane Utada|Utada Teruzane]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[enka]]}} singer [[Keiko Fuji]], Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to [[Tokyo]] as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]] was signed and, under the stage name '''Cubic U''', Utada released her English-language debut album ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut ''[[First Love (Utada Hikaru album)|First Love]]'' was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \"[[Automatic (Utada Hikaru song)|Automatic]]\", \"[[Time Will Tell (Utada Hikaru song)|Time Will Tell]]\", and \"[[Movin' On Without You]]\", the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the [[Oricon]] charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. ''First Love'' eventually became the country's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] of all time.\n\nHer following album ''[[Distance (Utada Hikaru album)|Distance]]'' was released in early 2001 and spawned Utada's biggest hit singles\u2014\"[[Addicted to You (Utada Hikaru song)|Addicted to You]]\", \"[[Wait & See (Risk)]]\" and \"[[Can You Keep a Secret?

The album was commercially successful and broke several sales records after three million copies were sold in its first week of availability in Japan, instantly becoming the country's [[Lists of fastest-selling albums#Japan|fastest-selling album]]. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as \"[[Traveling (song)|Traveling]]\", \"[[Hikari (Utada Hikaru song)|Hikari]]\" and \"[[Sakura Drops]]\", ''[[Deep River (Utada Hikaru album)|Deep River]]'', which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and went on to become one of Japan's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|top-selling records]] of all-time. Subsequent full-length releases\u2014''[[Exodus (Utada Hikaru album)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Ultra Blue]]'' and ''[[Heart Station]]''\u2014achieved million-selling status certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released acoustic-driven ''[[Fant\u00f4me (album)|Fant\u00f4me]]'' and ''[[Hatsukoi (Utada Hikaru album)|Hatsukoi]]'', which reached number-one on the [[Oricon]] album charts.\n\nBy the end of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by ''[[The Japan Times]]''.

The number of seats in the State Senate was increased from 60 to 61.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/districting-plan-drawn-in-albany-some-incumbents-may-lose-seats.html ''DISTRICTING PLAN DRAWN IN ALBANY; SOME INCUMBENTS MAY LOSE SEATS''] by E. J. Dionne Jr, in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on May 9, 1982</ref> The new district lines were [[gerrymander]]ed by the Republican Senate majority to increase Republican strength, and by the Democratic Assembly majority to increase Democratic strength.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/nyregion/how-new-lines-will-affect-political-races.html ''HOW NEW LINES WILL AFFECT POLITICAL RACES''] by James Feron, in ''The New York Times'' on May 16, 1982</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 1982, a special panel of three federal judges ordered Special Master Robert P. Patterson Jr. to revise the new apportionment proposed by the Legislature.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/nyregion/court-appointees-to-modify-redistricting-plan-for-state.html ''COURT APPOINTEES TO MODIFY REDISTRICTING PLAN FOR STATE''] by Arnold H. Lubasch, in ''The New York Times'' on June 24, 1982</ref>\n\nOn July 3, 1982, the revised re-apportionment was approved by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/04/nyregion/new-redistricting-by-new-york-state-is-approved-by-us.html ''NEW REDISTRICTING BY NEW YORK STATE IS APPROVED BY U.S.''] by Jane Perlez, in ''The New York Times'' on July 4, 1982</ref>\n\nThus, under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1938 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision to follow the [[One man, one vote]] rule, re-apportioned in 1982 by the Legislature, 61 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts for two-year terms. Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], a \"Statewide Independent Party\", a \"Unity Party\", the [[New Alliance Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1982|New York state election, 1982]], was held on November 2. Lieutenant Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Governor, and Westchester County Executive [[Alfred DelBello]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other three statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the three incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, a Democratic Attorney General and a Democratic U.S. Senator. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,560,000; Republicans 2,249,000; Conservatives 230,000; Liberals 116,000; Right to Life 52,000; Libertarians 17,000; Statewide Independents 16,000; Unity 6,000; New Alliance 5,000; and Socialist Workers 4,000.\n\nSixteen of the nineteen women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]; [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]]; [[Olga A.

Shaffer]] (Dem.), of [[North Blenheim, New York|North Blenheim]]; and [[Helene Weinstein]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]]\u2014were re-elected. [[Anna V. Jefferson]] (Dem.), an accountant of [[Brooklyn]], was also elected to the State Senate. [[Cynthia Jenkins]] (Dem.), a librarian of [[Queens]]; [[Helen M. Marshall]] (Dem.), a teacher and librarian of [[Queens]]; [[Nettie Mayersohn]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]]; [[Mary M. McPhillips]] (Dem.), of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]; [[Barbara Patton]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]]; and [[Louise M. Slaughter]] (Dem.), of [[Fairport, New York|Fairport]]; were also elected to the Assembly. Gail S. Shaffer did not take her seat in the Assembly, and was appointed as [[Secretary of State of New York]] instead.\n\nOn May 24, 1983, [[Julia Harrison]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 185th Legislature finished having 23 women members, surpassing the previous record of 19 in the [[184th New York State Legislature]] (in 1982).\n\nThe New York state election, 1983, was held on November 8.

The number of seats in the State Senate was increased from 60 to 61.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/districting-plan-drawn-in-albany-some-incumbents-may-lose-seats.html ''DISTRICTING PLAN DRAWN IN ALBANY; SOME INCUMBENTS MAY LOSE SEATS''] by E. J. Dionne Jr, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on May 9, 1982</ref> The new district lines were [[gerrymander]]ed by the Republican Senate majority to increase Republican strength, and by the Democratic Assembly majority to increase Democratic strength.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/nyregion/how-new-lines-will-affect-political-races.html ''HOW NEW LINES WILL AFFECT POLITICAL RACES''] by James Feron, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on May 16, 1982</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 1982, a special panel of three federal judges ordered Special Master Robert P. Patterson Jr. to revise the new apportionment proposed by the Legislature.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/nyregion/court-appointees-to-modify-redistricting-plan-for-state.html ''COURT APPOINTEES TO MODIFY REDISTRICTING PLAN FOR STATE''] by Arnold H. Lubasch, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on June 24, 1982</ref>\n\nOn July 3, 1982, the revised re-apportionment was approved by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/04/nyregion/new-redistricting-by-new-york-state-is-approved-by-us.html ''NEW REDISTRICTING BY NEW YORK STATE IS APPROVED BY U.S.''] by Jane Perlez, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on July 4, 1982</ref>\n\nThus, under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1938 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision to follow the [[One man, one vote]] rule, re-apportioned in 1982 by the Legislature, 61 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts for two-year terms. Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], a \"Statewide Independent Party\", a \"Unity Party\", the [[New Alliance Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1982|New York state election, 1982]], was held on November 2. Lieutenant Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Governor, and Westchester County Executive [[Alfred DelBello]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other three statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the three incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, a Democratic Attorney General and a Democratic U.S. Senator. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,560,000; Republicans 2,249,000; Conservatives 230,000; Liberals 116,000; Right to Life 52,000; Libertarians 17,000; Statewide Independents 16,000; Unity 6,000; New Alliance 5,000; and Socialist Workers 4,000.\n\nSixteen of the nineteen women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]; [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]]; [[Olga A.

Shaffer]] (Dem.), of [[North Blenheim, New York|North Blenheim]]; and [[Helene Weinstein]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]]\u2014were re-elected. [[Anna V.

Marshall]] (Dem.), a teacher and librarian of [[Queens]]; [[Nettie Mayersohn]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]]; [[Mary M. McPhillips]] (Dem.), of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]; [[Barbara Patton]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]]; and [[Louise M. Slaughter]] (Dem.), of [[Fairport, New York|Fairport]]; were also elected to the Assembly. Gail S. Shaffer did not take her seat in the Assembly, and was appointed as [[Secretary of State of New York]] instead.\n\nOn May 24, 1983, [[Julia Harrison]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 185th Legislature finished having 23 women members, surpassing the previous record of 19 in the [[184th New York State Legislature]] (in 1982).\n\nThe New York state election, 1983, was held on November 8.

Raja and Seenu, short of money, sell a record number of dictionaries to impress Bill Gates ([[Brahmaji]]) and take the required money from him. On reaching the pet shop, their bag gets exchanged in a bedlam at pet shop with Giri's bag. After a belated realization, they search for Giri and find out that Giri has set the bag on fire thinking that the bag had contained the love letters his sister received.

Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007.

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people.

of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people.

Macdonald also provided funds for the purchase and maintenance of the School's initial equipment. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building burned down in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

Macdonald also provided funds for the purchase and maintenance of the School's initial equipment. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]].

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|Second World War]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment.

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. Its popularity stems from the speed at which it can be easily performed. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer.

Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer.

Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;Stickerless : A puzzle that uses colored plastic instead of stickers to indicate color. Most stickerless puzzles were forbidden in competitions prior to a 2015 update of WCA regulations. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/compare/official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01?short_path=7487711|title=Comparing official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01 \u00b7 thewca/wca-regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{visible anchor|Summer Variation}} : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;{{visible anchor|TPS}} : Turns per second \u2013 the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more.

It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly. There are a total of 27 cases. WV has an average lower move count than the standard OLL.\n;WR :World Record.\n;{{visible anchor|X-Cross}} : Completing one or multiple F2L pairs during the cross setup, used almost exclusively in the CFOP method.\n;YTUWR : YouTube Unofficial World Record, the fastest of something that is posted on YouTube.\n;{{visible anchor|ZBLL}} :ZBLL is a set of 177 algorithms (Not including mirrors and inverses) with 494 cases to recognize in order to solve the last layer in one look while all of the top edges are oriented with an average move count of ~12.08. Can be used in any layer-by-layer method that ends in N-Look LL, but will only really be efficient in ZZ and Petrus, as these methods keep edges oriented, whereas methods such as CFOP do not keep the edges oriented, becoming a sometimes 2LLL solve.\n\n==See also==\n*[[World Cube Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/ Speedsolving.com]\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Speedsolving.com Wiki]\n*[http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html Fridrich Method]\n*[http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html Roux Method]\n*[http://cube.crider.co.uk/ ZZ Method]\n*[https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/ World Cube Association]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date= June 2014}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:Erik Akkersdijk is solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube in 10.50s.ogv|thumb|[[Erik Akkersdijk]] solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube in 10.50 seconds.]]\n[[File:Speedcubing-Twilightsojourn.jpg|thumb|A speedcuber solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube.]]\n'''Speedcubing''' (also known as '''speedsolving''') is the hobby involving solving a variety of [[Combination puzzle|combination or twisty puzzles]], the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or [[Rubik's Cube]], as quickly as possible. For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. Its popularity stems from the speed at which it can be easily performed. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;{{visible anchor|1LLL}} : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, put on blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;Stickerless : A puzzle that uses colored plastic instead of stickers to indicate color. Most stickerless puzzles were forbidden in competitions prior to a 2015 update of WCA regulations. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/compare/official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01?short_path=7487711|title=Comparing official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01 \u00b7 thewca/wca-regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{visible anchor|Summer Variation}} : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;{{visible anchor|TPS}} : Turns per second \u2013 the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more. It can also be given in other cases, such as when the competitor starts the timer too slow or does not correctly stop the timer after finishing the solve.\n;UWR :Unofficial World Record.\n\n;{{visible anchor|VLS}} : Valk Last Slot. A set of 432 algorithms (216 if mirrors are not counted), that solves together the last F2L pair and all of OLL when this last F2L pair is already joined.\n;'''WCA''' : [[World Cube Association]], the international governing body for official cube competitions.\n;{{visible anchor|Winter Variation}}, also known as WV :A subset of algorithms for VLS that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair is already formed. It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly. There are a total of 27 cases.
