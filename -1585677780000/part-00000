It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]], and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. The song also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\nThe song has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, \"Station to Station\" has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would later recall that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using flangers and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the \"Station to Station\" track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]],\"<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, stating: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite [...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes of this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present in the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> Bowie at different points declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and Brechtian theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23 January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of 3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call 2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10 minutes in length, the song is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]], and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. The song also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\nThe song has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, \"Station to Station\" has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would later recall that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using flangers and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the \"Station to Station\" track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]],\"<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, stating: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite [...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes of this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present in the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> Bowie at different points declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and Brechtian theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23 January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of 3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call 2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]], whether familial platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, caressing and massaging, and physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9guen|first=Nicolas|last2=Fischer-Lokou|first2=Jacques|date=February 2003|title=Another Evaluation of Touch and Helping Behavior|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=92|issue=1|pages=62\u201364|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|pmid=12674258|issn=0033-2941}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain [[Proxemics|proximity]] is necessary. For instance, a sustained [[eye contact]] is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else's personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.\n\nMost people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and [[human sexuality]], and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of [[oxytocin]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], and in a reduction in stress [[hormone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-28-touch-healing_N.htm |title=Human touch may have some healing properties |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed, however there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, they also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed via language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|date=1991|title=Relational message interpretations of touch, conversational distance, and posture|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=15|issue=4|pages=233\u2013259|doi=10.1007/bf00986924|issn=0191-5886}}</ref>\n\nInducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources. During colder seasons, humans as well as other animals seek physical intimacy with one another as a means to apportion thermoregulation.<ref>Stabentheiner, Anton, et al. \"Endothermic heat production in honeybee winter clusters.\" Journal of Experimental Biology 206.2 (2003): 353-358.</ref> Some forms of physical touch among monkeys and apes, serve multiple functions, including cleaning, treatment of a lice influx or infection and social grooming.<ref>Diezinger, F.

This attitude is especially marked amongst those with [[haphephobia]].<ref>Synnott, Anthony. \"Bodily senses.\" The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality (2015).</ref> One study has shown that there's generally a higher level of physical intimacy allowed between [[immediate family]] members than between [[second-degree relative]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2015/10/the-body-map-of-acceptable-social-touching.php|title=The Body Map of Acceptable Social Touching - PsyBlog|date=28 October 2015|website=Spring.org.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}</ref> Intimacy norms are usually more negative near [[erogenous zone]]s.

The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers\u2019 abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed. In addition to necessary functions like breastfeeding, touch is also used to sooth and calm babies or with skin-to-skin contact called \"kangaroo care.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferber|first=Sari Goldstein|last2=Feldman|first2=Ruth|last3=Makhoul|first3=Imad R.|date=June 2008|title=The development of maternal touch across the first year of life|journal=Early Human Development|volume=84|issue=6|pages=363\u2013370|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.09.019|pmid=17988808|issn=0378-3782}}</ref> Vision and auditory senses are limited in infancy and babies are introduced to their world primarily through touch and are able to distinguish between temperature and texture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|last2=Hernandez-Reif|first2=Maria|last3=Diego|first3=Miguel|date=2010-05-04|title=Depressed mothers' newborns are less responsive to animate and inanimate stimuli|journal=Infant and Child Development|volume=20|issue=1|pages=94\u2013105|doi=10.1002/icd.687|issn=1522-7227}}</ref>\n\nDecreased amounts of affectionate touch from caregivers (i.e. for infants in institutional settings or infants with depressed mothers) is related to cognitive and neurodevelopmental delays.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MACLEAN|first=KIM|date=2003-11-14|title=The impact of institutionalization on child development|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=15|issue=4|pages=853\u2013884|doi=10.1017/s0954579403000415|issn=0954-5794}}</ref> These delays appear to persist for years and sometimes whole lifetimes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Celia|last2=Maughan|first2=Barbara|last3=Rutter|first3=Michael|last4=Castle|first4=Jenny|last5=Colvert|first5=Emma|last6=Groothues|first6=Christine|last7=Kreppner|first7=Jana|last8=Stevens|first8=Suzanne|last9=O'Connor|first9=Thomas G.|date=May 2006|title=Do the Effects of Early Severe Deprivation on Cognition Persist Into Early Adolescence?

However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable.<ref name=Hall /> In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], are unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a [[bar]], [[nightclub]], [[rock concert]], [[festival|street festival]], etc.\n\n==Display of affection==\nPeople who are on a [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiar basis]] may enter into each other's personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an [[intimate relationship]] or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:\n* cuddling,\n* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),\n* [[tickling]] (e.g. back and waist),\n* [[massage]] (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or\n* [[touching heads]].\n\nBonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.\n\nIn public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a [[public display of affection]] is generally constrained by [[social norm]]s and can range from a gesture, such as a [[kiss]] or [[hug]] in greeting, to an embrace or [[holding hands]]. Maintaining [[eye contact]] can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|date=January 1999|title=Preschoolers in America are Touched Less and are More Aggressive Than Preschoolers in France|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=151|issue=1|pages=11\u201317|doi=10.1080/0300443991510102|issn=0300-4430}}</ref> Peoples living nearer to the equator (Mediterranean, central and south America, Islamic countries) tend to have high-contact social norms, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (northern Europe, north America, northeast Asian).

Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]], whether familial platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, caressing and massaging, and physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9guen|first=Nicolas|last2=Fischer-Lokou|first2=Jacques|date=February 2003|title=Another Evaluation of Touch and Helping Behavior|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=92|issue=1|pages=62\u201364|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|pmid=12674258|issn=0033-2941}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain [[Proxemics|proximity]] is necessary. For instance, a sustained [[eye contact]] is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else's personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.\n\nMost people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and [[human sexuality]], and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of [[oxytocin]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], and in a reduction in stress [[hormone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-28-touch-healing_N.htm |title=Human touch may have some healing properties |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed, however there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, they also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed via language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|date=1991|title=Relational message interpretations of touch, conversational distance, and posture|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=15|issue=4|pages=233\u2013259|doi=10.1007/bf00986924|issn=0191-5886}}</ref>\n\nInducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources.

The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers\u2019 abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed.

However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable.<ref name=Hall /> In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], are unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a [[bar]], [[nightclub]], [[rock concert]], [[festival|street festival]], etc.\n\n==Display of affection==\nPeople who are on a [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiar basis]] may enter into each other's personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an [[intimate relationship]] or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:\n* cuddling,\n* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),\n* [[tickling]] (e.g. back and waist),\n* [[massage]] (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or\n* [[touching heads]].\n\nBonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.\n\nIn public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a [[public display of affection]] is generally constrained by [[social norm]]s and can range from a gesture, such as a [[kiss]] or [[hug]] in greeting, to an embrace or [[holding hands]]. Maintaining [[eye contact]] can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|date=January 1999|title=Preschoolers in America are Touched Less and are More Aggressive Than Preschoolers in France|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=151|issue=1|pages=11\u201317|doi=10.1080/0300443991510102|issn=0300-4430}}</ref> Peoples living nearer to the equator tend to have high-contact social norms (Mediterranean, central and south America, Islamic countries, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (northern Europe, north America, northeast Asian).

Also known from a legend in the 1700s when a Native American Girl committed suicide by jumping off the Mountaintop from the loss of her love.\n\n==Geography==\nRoughly {{convert|3|mi|0}} long by {{convert|0.75|mi}} wide, Lamentation Mountain is located within the towns of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]], and [[Meriden, Connecticut]].\n\nCrescent Lake, (formerly called Bradley Hubbard Reservoir), lies nestled in the gap between Lamentation Mountain and Chauncey Peak. The lake provides emergency drinking water to the city of Meriden. Silver Lake, visible from the cliffs, is located in the low gap between Lamentation Mountain and Cathole Mountain.\n\nThe Metacomet Ridge continues west from Lamentation Mountain to become [[Cathole Mountain]] of the [[Hanging Hills]]; it continues south as [[Chauncey Peak]]. Another, lower extension continues {{convert|8|mi|0}} north culminating in the uplands of [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]]. The southern half of Lamentation Mountain drains into the [[Quinnipiac River]], thence to Long Island Sound; the northern half to the Mattabesett River, then to the [[Connecticut River]], thence to Long Island Sound.\n\n==Geology and ecology==\nLamentation Mountain, like much of the Metacomet Ridge, is composed of [[basalt]], also called traprock, a [[volcanic]] rock. The mountain formed near the end of the [[Triassic Period]] with the [[rift (geology)|rifting]] apart of the [[North America]]n continent from [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]]. [[Lava]] welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[earthquake]] activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of Lamentation Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt [[scree|talus]] produce a combination of [[microclimate]] ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut. Lamentation Mountain is also an important [[birds of prey|raptor]] migration path. (See [[Metacomet Ridge]] for more information on the geology and ecosystem of Lamentation Mountain).\n\n==Recreation and conservation==\nThe southern third of Lamentation Mountain lies within [[Giuffrida Park]], managed by the city of Meriden. The park boasts a lake, golf course, woodlands, and the rocky peaks of Lamentation Mountain and Chauncey Peak. Permitted activities within the park include [[hiking]], [[snowshoeing]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[picnicking]], and [[bicycling]]. [[Human swimming|Swimming]], [[boating]], and [[fishing]] are prohibited on Crescent Lake. [[Rock climbing]] is prohibited within the park but is permitted elsewhere on the mountain. The park supports a number of trails, most notably the 50 mile (80k) Mattabesett Trail which stretches from the northern end of Lamentation Mountain, south to [[Totoket Mountain]] and north again to the Connecticut River. The 51 mile (80k) [[Metacomet Trail]] connects to the Mattabesett Trail at the foot of Lamentation Mountain; the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]] maintains both trails.  Trailhead parking for Lamentation Mountain is located at Giufridda Park on Westfield Road, {{convert|1.2|mi}} east of its junction with [[U.S. Route 5]] and {{convert|1.8|mi}} west of [[Interstate 91]], exit 20, via Country Club Road (which becomes Westfield Road) and alongside Spruce Brook Road in Berlin, 0.5 miles (0.75&nbsp;km) east of its junction with U.S. Route 5 and {{convert|1.75|mi}} south of Berlin center.\n\nIn 2000, Lamentation Mountain was included in a study by the [[National Park Service]] for the designation of a new [[National Scenic Trail]] now tentatively called the [[New England National Scenic Trail]], which would include the [[Metacomet-Monadnock Trail]] in Massachusetts and the [[Mattabesett Trail]] and [[Metacomet Trail]] trails in Connecticut.\n\nThe Berlin Land Trust<ref>http://www.berlinlandtrust.org/</ref> and the Meriden land Trust<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20071216012420/http://www.meridenlandtrust.com/</ref> are active in the conservation of Lamentation Mountain and its viewshed.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lamentation Mountain State Park]]\n* [[Metacomet Ridge]]\n* [[Metacomet Trail]]\n* '''Adjacent summits:'''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" \n! \u2193 South !!

It was commissioned by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], to transport coal from his mines in [[Worsley]] to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.\n\nThe [[canal]] is connected to the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] via a lock at Cornbrook; to the [[Rochdale Canal]] in Manchester; to the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]], southeast of Runcorn; and to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] at Leigh. It once connected with the [[River Mersey]] at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]].\n\nFollowing the construction of the [[Sankey Brook Navigation]], Bridgewater has been argued to be the first true canal of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, and it required the construction of an [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] to cross the [[River Irwell]], one of the first of its kind. Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as [[Canal Mania]]. It later faced intense competition from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Macclesfield Canal]]. Navigable throughout its history, it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned. Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the [[Cheshire Ring]] network of canals.\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], owned some of the coal mines dug to supply [[North West England]] with fuel for the [[steam engine]]s instrumental in powering England's [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=pb15>{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=15}}</ref><ref name=chal34>{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=34}}</ref>  The duke transported his coal along the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] and also by [[packhorse]], but each method was inefficient and expensive; river transport was subject to the vagaries of river navigation,<ref>Vessels were affected by tide levels, and the shared use of water by industry</ref> and the amount of coal packhorses could carry was limited by its relative weight.{{sfn|Kindleberger|1993|p=192|ps=}}  The duke's underground mines also suffered from persistent flooding, caused by the [[geology]] of the Middle [[Coal Measures]], where the [[Worsley Four Foot mine|coal seam]] lies beneath a layer of permeable [[sandstone]].\n\nHaving visited the [[Canal du Midi]] in France and watched the construction of the [[Sankey Canal]] in England,<ref name=Penninewaterways>{{cite web |title=History of the Bridgewater Canal |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/bridgewater/bri2.htm |publisher=Pennine Waterways |accessdate=14 August 2008}}</ref> the duke's solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at Worsley, connected to a surface canal between [[Worsley]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].<ref name=\"Priestleyp89\">{{Harvnb|Priestley|1831|p=89}}</ref>  In addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines, an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for the surface canal, and also eliminate the need to lift the coal to the surface (an expensive and difficult proposition).

Passenger traffic in 1791 brought in receipts of \u00a33,781.<ref name=chal37/>\n\nThe canal also carried passengers and was in keen competition with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M&IN).  The journey down river by the latter route took eight hours (nine hours in the up direction) while the journey on the Bridgewater canal took nine hours each way.  Fares were similar but the Bridgewater route was said to be \"more picturesque\".{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=130|ps=}} [[Boating]] men also used the canal.  They lifted their small lightweight boats out of the M&IN at Runcorn, and carried them a short distance up the steep streets onto the Bridgewater Canal.{{sfn|Corbett|1974|p=40|ps=}}\n\nBarges on the canal continued to be towed by horses until the middle of the 19th century, when they were replaced by steam-powered boats after a fatal epidemic spread through the horse population. The \"dense smoke\" produced by the steam barges and their \"harsh unnecessary whistling\" proved unpopular with some local residents, who also began to suffer from a condition known as canal throat, \"no doubt caused by the foul emanations given off by its [the Bridgewater Canal's] horribly filthy water\".<ref name=AspinP48>{{Harvnb|Aspin|1995|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe canal carried commercial freight traffic until 1975; the last regular cargo was grain from Liverpool to Manchester for BOCM.

By his will the income from the canal was to be paid to his nephew [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|George Leveson-Gower]], the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland).  On his death it was to go to Stafford's second son [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Francis]], provided he changed his name to Egerton; and then to his heirs and successors. The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}</ref> These were [[Archibald Macdonald|Sir Archibald Macdonald]], who was [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]], at the time the [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and later the [[Archbishop of York]], and, as Superintendent, [[Robert Haldane Bradshaw]], the Duke's agent. Bradshaw managed the estate, for which he received a salary of \u00a32,000 a year and the use of the duke's mansions at Worsley and Runcorn. The other two trustees had each married nieces of the duke and were \"dummy trustees\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=6}}</ref>\n[[File:BridgewaterCanalTradeFigures.png|left|thumb|400px|Value of trade carried on the Bridgewater Canal 1806\u201371<ref name=mather358>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref>]]\nDuring the time the canal was administered by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year.<ref name=mather358/>  Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of the order of 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent.{{sfn|Mather|1970|p=7|ps=}}  Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a \"formidable bargainer\".{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=10\u201311|ps=}} In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal]] to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed.<ref name=\"Tomlinsonp33\"/> In 1810 there was a general agreement with the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] Company (M&IN) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from \"tonnage traffic\" (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own carriage of freight.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=12\u201315|ps=}} Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will.{{sfnp|Mather|1970|pp=21\u201323|ps=}} There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=17, 20|ps=}}\n\nDuring the 1820s there was increased dissatisfaction with the canals. They did not cope well with increasing volumes of cargo, and they were perceived as monopolistic, and the preserve of the landed gentry class.  There was increased interest in the possibility of railway construction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=27\u201333}}</ref>  The possible construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester was vigorously opposed by Bradshaw, who refused railway surveyors access to land owned by the Trustees.  When the first [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was presented to parliament in 1825, the Trustees opposed and it was overthrown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=36\u201337}}</ref> However, later in the year Lord Stafford, possibly persuaded to do so by [[William Huskisson]], invested \u00a3100,000 (one-fifth of the required capital), in the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].  Following this the Trustees withdrew their opposition to the construction of the railway; they did not petition against the second bill, which was passed in 1826.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=38\u201341}}</ref> At the same time as he made his investment in the railway, Lord Stafford advanced \u00a340,000 for improvements to the canal. This was spent mainly on a second line of locks at Runcorn, which were completed in 1828, plus new warehouses at Manchester and Liverpool.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>  The additional line of locks cost \u00a335,000<ref name=\"Starkeyp179\">{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=179}}</ref> and was used for traffic heading to Manchester, while the old line was used for traffic passing down to the Mersey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=173}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830 the new railway opened and by the end of the year was carrying freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=57\u201361}}</ref> In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a [[stroke]], as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=80\u201382, 85}}</ref>\n\nMatters came to a head in 1833, the year in which the canal made its lowest profit since the death of the Duke.<ref name=mather358/> On 19&nbsp;July the Marquess of Stafford (now the 1st Duke of Sutherland) died and the profits from the canal passed to Francis Egerton. On 25&nbsp;September Bradshaw's son, [[James Bradshaw (MP for Brackley)|Captain James Bradshaw]], who had been acting as a deputy superintendent to the Trustees, and who had been expected to succeed his father as Superintendent, committed suicide. The agent for both Francis Egerton and his older brother, who was now the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|2nd Duke of Sutherland]], was [[James Loch]].<ref name=mather84>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=84\u201386}}</ref>  The events that followed were \"stage-managed by Loch\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=85}}</ref> He reported to Francis Egerton that Bradshaw was no longer fit to be Superintendent, and then persuaded Bradshaw to retire on his full salary. It had been expected that he would appoint his other son, William Rigby Bradshaw, as his successor, but Loch persuaded him to appoint James Sothern in the position; Sothern had been the principal agent of the Trust since December 1832. He took over the position of Superintendent on 3&nbsp;February 1834.<ref name=mather84/>  The appointment of Sothern was not a success. Charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism. He entered into disputes and disagreements with Loch, with Francis Egerton, and with the other two trustees. (Sir Archibald Macdonald had died in 1826; by this time his place had been taken by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|10th Earl of Devon]]). To avoid a costly lawsuit, at the end of 1836 Sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of \u00a345,000. On 1&nbsp;March 1837, he was succeeded as Superintendent by James Loch.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=87\u201397}}</ref>\n\nLoch was extremely busy and did not have time to deal with the detailed administration of the Trust. He therefore looked for a deputy to take on these duties. His first choice was Richard Smith who was the mine agent to the Trustees of the [[John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|1st Earl of Dudley]].

This was the period in the mid-1840s known as the [[Railway Mania]].  The railways competed with the canals in three ways; by building, or threatening to build, new lines which would be in direct competition with the canals; by amalgamation into giant companies (such as the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] and the [[London and North Western Railway|London and North Western]] companies), which gave them more political power; and by taking over ownership of canal companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=176\u2013180}}</ref>  On 13&nbsp;April 1844 ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported that the canal was to be emptied of water, and converted into a railway,<ref>{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: The Bridgewater Canal | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&fromDate=1785-01-01&currentPageNumber=1&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=default&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08-015&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=1638&addRefineFilters=&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&next_Page=false&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=1&date_mm_From=01&date_yyyy_From=1785&date_dd_to_range=31&date_mm_to_range=12&date_yyyy_to_range=1985&date_dd_from_precise=1&date_mm_from_precise=01&date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText= |date=13 April 1844|accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London |first1=Rachel |last1=Sylvester |first2=Sam |last2=Coates}}</ref> although nothing came of this scheme.

The vessel, a flat named the Express, was wholly laden with a valuable cargo of wines and spirits, in all about 40 tons weight, belonging to Mr. William Gibb, spirit merchant, of this town, whose active and long-continued exertions in the struggle to obtain the privilege of bonding for this great and important borough are about to be acknowledged in the form of a substantial mark of respect and gratitude by his fellow-townsmen. The Express arrived from Liverpool on Saturday evening; but it was yesterday morning before she began to unload. She is lying in the Bridgewater Canal, Knott Mill where the Duke's trustees have constructed a large bonding vault, which Mr. Gibb has taken and had licensed for the purpose, and we believe he is now removing his stock of wine and spirits from other ports to Manchester, for the greater convenience of sampling and sale. The lockers, gaugers, and other officers of Customs were in attendance, superintending the unloading of the vessel and thus have commenced the operations of the Manchester Custom-house. It is a gratifying circumstance that a gentleman who took so prominent a part in the struggle to obtain the boon of bonding for Manchester should be the first to enjoy the fruits of its success. We hope ere long to record the general operation of the system; though it will require a little time, perhaps, as it must have a beginning. -&nbsp;''Manchester Guardian''<ref>{{citation |last=author unknown |title=First arrival in the Port of Manchester of a cargo of goods for bond |newspaper=The Times |page=6 |date=10 October 1844}}\n</ref>|}}\n\nHowever, this venture was less successful than expected, as is evidenced by a letter to ''[[The Observer]]'' later that year, also printed in ''The Times'':\n\n{{quote|<center>MANCHESTER A BONDING PORT</center> After the pressing demands which have been made by some of our principal manufacturing towns for the privileges of inland bonded warehouses for goods subject to Customs duties, it would naturally be supposed that the formation of a Custom-house establishment at Manchester would have occasioned a vast quantity of business in that extensive seat of British manufacturers; but we are informed that the result is very different from what had been expected. Although the system has been introduced into Manchester only as an experiment and a large establishment has been formed entirely of old and experienced officers; under the impression that the extent of business there would require the constant services of well tried men, we believe that, up to the present period, little trade has passed through the Manchester Custom-house and the officers' duties are nearly approaching to a sinecure. The total annual expense of this establishment, exclusive of that for the Custom-house and warehouse is \u00a32,620. The town council of the borough of Manchester, however, are made liable, under the act of the 7th and 8th of Victoria cap 81, to the charges of maintaining this establishment, and the public are thereby exonerated from the expense. <br />-&nbsp;''Observer''<ref>{{citation |last=author unknown |title=Manchester a bonding port |newspaper=The Times |page=2 |date= 3 December 1844}}</ref>|}}\n\nBetween 1849 and 1851 the competition between the Trustees and the railway companies intensified.  Agreements and alliances were made and broken.  Their major opponents were the London and North Western Railway and the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] who reduced tariffs and took business away from the canals.  For the first time the railways carried more trade between Liverpool and the towns of central Lancashire than the canals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=195\u2013225}}</ref>  The value of the traffic carried by the Bridgewater Canal in 1851 was the lowest in the time it was administered by the Trustees.<ref name=mather358/>  In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted [[Royal visits to Manchester and Salford during the reign of Queen Victoria|a visit to Manchester]] by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].  They stayed at Worsley Hall, with a view of the canal, and were given a trip between [[Patricroft railway station]] and Worsley Hall, on state barges.  Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbett|1974|p=43}}</ref>\n\nThe Trustees spent much time between 1851 and 1855 in negotiations to ease the competition, especially that from the London and North Western Railway.  The most likely allies seemed to be other railway companies, including the [[Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway|Shrewsbury and Birmingham]] and the [[Shrewsbury to Chester Line|Shrewsbury and Chester]] railway companies, and the Great Western Railway.  Of these, the most likely seemed to be the Great Western Railway who, in their concern to expand northwards were willing to help the Trustees with the carriage of their traffic to the south.  However years of negotiations came to no agreement and, in the end, the Trustees' railway deal was done with the London and North Western Railway, who agreed to cooperate with the onward passage of the Trustees' traffic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=226\u2013256}}</ref>\n\nOn 28&nbsp;June 1855 James Loch, the Superintendent, died and was succeeded by [[Algernon Egerton|Hon. Algernon Fulke Egerton]], Lord Ellesmere's third son.  He was then aged 29, and had been educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]; he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=267}}</ref>  Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly in control of the management of the Trustees, assisted by his son [[George Loch]].  During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845.  With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=268\u2013269}}</ref>  During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=259\u2013267}}</ref>  Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=260}}</ref> and now his opportunity came.  He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref> and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business.  The [[Steamboat|steamers]] owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=272\u2013273}}</ref>\n\nGeorge Loch, who had been opposed to using the Trustees' investments for improvements to the canals or docks, died in 1857. Between 1857 and 1872 the Trustees provided more capital for improvements from their own resources than at any previous time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=280}}</ref>  The [[Runcorn and Weston Canal]] was built in 1858\u201359, providing a connection between Runcorn Docks and the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation]].

It was commissioned by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], to transport coal from his mines in [[Worsley]] to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.\n\nThe [[canal]] is connected to the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] via a lock at Cornbrook; to the [[Rochdale Canal]] in Manchester; to the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]], southeast of Runcorn; and to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] at Leigh. It once connected with the [[River Mersey]] at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]].\n\nFollowing the construction of the [[Sankey Brook Navigation]], Bridgewater has been argued to be the first true canal of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, and it required the construction of an [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] to cross the [[River Irwell]], one of the first of its kind. Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as [[Canal Mania]]. It later faced intense competition from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Macclesfield Canal]]. Navigable throughout its history, it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned. Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the [[Cheshire Ring]] network of canals.\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], owned some of the coal mines dug to supply [[North West England]] with fuel for the [[steam engine]]s instrumental in powering England's [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=pb15>{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=15}}</ref><ref name=chal34>{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=34}}</ref>  The duke transported his coal along the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] and also by [[packhorse]], but each method was inefficient and expensive; river transport was subject to the vagaries of river navigation,<ref>Vessels were affected by tide levels, and the shared use of water by industry</ref> and the amount of coal packhorses could carry was limited by its relative weight.{{sfn|Kindleberger|1993|p=192|ps=}}  The duke's underground mines also suffered from persistent flooding, caused by the [[geology]] of the Middle [[Coal Measures]], where the [[Worsley Four Foot mine|coal seam]] lies beneath a layer of permeable [[sandstone]].\n\nHaving visited the [[Canal du Midi]] in France and watched the construction of the [[Sankey Canal]] in England,<ref name=Penninewaterways>{{cite web |title=History of the Bridgewater Canal |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/bridgewater/bri2.htm |publisher=Pennine Waterways |accessdate=14 August 2008}}</ref> the duke's solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at Worsley, connected to a surface canal between [[Worsley]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].<ref name=\"Priestleyp89\">{{Harvnb|Priestley|1831|p=89}}</ref>  In addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines, an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for the surface canal, and also eliminate the need to lift the coal to the surface (an expensive and difficult proposition).

His initial plan was to make the terminus at Hempstones, east of Runcorn Gap,<!-- where the Mersey narrows between the town of Runcorn and a promontory which was to later form part of the town of [[Widnes]] - not certain this is relevant so will leave hidden for now--> but following a study of the tides and depth of water there, he decided instead to build the terminus west of Runcorn Gap.{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=125|ps=}}  This change was designed to accommodate [[Mersey Flat|Mersey flats]], although the low fixed bridges required that traffic on the canal be able to lower or unship their masts.<ref name=st13>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=13}}</ref>  Runcorn basin was almost {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} above the Mersey,{{sfn|Nickson|1887|p=159|ps=}} so a flight of ten locks, described as \"the wonder of their time\",{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=127|ps=}} was built to connect the two.  Nine locks had a fall of {{convert|2|m|ft|0}}, with a fall at the river lock of more than {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} at low water. It allowed vessels to enter and leave the canal on any [[tide]]. The connection to the Mersey was made on 1&nbsp;January 1773.<ref name=st126/>  The river's tidal action tended to deposit [[silt]] around the lower entrance to the locks, so to counteract this a channel, equipped with gates at each end and known as the Duke's Gut, was cut through the marshes upriver from the locks.  At high tide the gates were closed, and with the ebb of the tide were opened to release water, which scoured the silt from the entrance to the locks.  The cut created an island, known as Runcorn Island, crossed by Castle Bridge.{{sfn|1970|p=20}}{{sfn|Starkey|1990|pp=128\u2013129|ps=}}<ref>It was known as Castle Bridge because it made a connection with a rocky promontory which had once been the site of a castle built by [[Ethelfleda]] to defend her kingdom of [[Mercia]] from [[Viking]] invasion.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stretford.jpg|thumb|left|Ordnance Survey map of 1843 showing the canal crossing the River Mersey at Barfoot Bridge, Stretford]]\n[[File:Runcorn soapworks.jpg|left|thumb|The canal at Runcorn between the factories]]\n[[File:OS One-inch Sheet 100 Extract Runcorn Bridgewater Canal 1966.jpg|left|thumb|Extract from OS one-inch sheet 100 showing the junction between the Bridgewater Canal and the Manchester Ship Canal at Runcorn, with the flight of locks, as it was in 1966]]\nThe connection to Manchester was delayed by [[Brooke baronets|Sir Richard Brooke]] of [[Norton Priory]]. Concerned that boatmen might poach his game and wildfowl, Brooke did not want the canal to pass through his land. The Act included several stipulations: the canal should not come within {{convert|325|m|ft|0}} of his house; the towpath should be on the south side of the canal, furthest away from Brooke's house; there should be no quays, buildings, hedges or fences to obstruct the view; no vessels were to be moored within {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} of the house, other than during construction.  Eventually, though, a compromise was reached.  This included the construction of a link to the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]] (permitted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Act of 1766),{{sfn|Priestley|1831|p=90|ps=}} and the building of the canal's terminus to the west of Runcorn Gap.<ref name=st126/>  The Trent and Mersey link gave the Duke access to the Midlands, and forestalled the Weaver Trustees from making their own junction with the canal.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=xvi\u2013xvii|ps=}} The new extension also met with opposition from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, until the duke purchased a controlling interest in the company.<ref name=chal35/>  The first part of the new extension was opened in 1767,<ref name=\"Chalonerp36\">{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=36}}</ref> and completed in full by March 1776,<ref name=st126>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=126}}</ref> but Brindley did not live to see its completion; it was continued by his brother-in-law, [[Hugh Henshall]].<ref name=anon29/>\n\nThe total cost of the canal, from Worsley to Manchester and from Longford Bridge to the Mersey at Runcorn, was \u00a3220,000.{{sfn|Nickson|1887|p=161|ps=}}  Alongside the Mersey, the duke built [[Port of Runcorn|Runcorn Dock]], several warehouses, and [[Bridgewater House, Runcorn|Bridgewater House]], a temporary home from which he could supervise operations at the Runcorn end.

Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit was connected to the canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west direction from the canal at Boothstown to the pit.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=31\u201332|ps=}} Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his [[Astley and Tyldesley Collieries|Gin Pit Colliery]] to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The tramroad was later worked by locomotives.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=148|ps=}} In 1867 the [[Fletcher, Burrows and Company|Fletchers]] built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from [[Howe Bridge]] onto barges.

The journey down river by the latter route took eight hours (nine hours in the up direction) while the journey on the Bridgewater canal took nine hours each way.  Fares were similar but the Bridgewater route was said to be \"more picturesque\".{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=130|ps=}} [[Boating]] men also used the canal.  They lifted their small lightweight boats out of the M&IN at Runcorn, and carried them a short distance up the steep streets onto the Bridgewater Canal.{{sfn|Corbett|1974|p=40|ps=}}\n\nBarges on the canal continued to be towed by horses until the middle of the 19th century, when they were replaced by steam-powered boats after a fatal epidemic spread through the horse population. The \"dense smoke\" produced by the steam barges and their \"harsh unnecessary whistling\" proved unpopular with some local residents, who also began to suffer from a condition known as canal throat, \"no doubt caused by the foul emanations given off by its [the Bridgewater Canal's] horribly filthy water\".<ref name=AspinP48>{{Harvnb|Aspin|1995|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe canal carried commercial freight traffic until 1975; the last regular cargo was grain from Liverpool to Manchester for BOCM. It is now used mainly by pleasure craft and hosts two [[sport rowing|rowing]] clubs&nbsp;\u2013 Trafford Rowing Club and Manchester University Boat Club.\n\n== Bridgewater Trustees ==\nThe Duke of Bridgewater died on 8 March 1803.  By his will the income from the canal was to be paid to his nephew [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|George Leveson-Gower]], the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland).  On his death it was to go to Stafford's second son [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Francis]], provided he changed his name to Egerton; and then to his heirs and successors. The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}</ref> These were [[Archibald Macdonald|Sir Archibald Macdonald]], who was [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]], at the time the [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and later the [[Archbishop of York]], and, as Superintendent, [[Robert Haldane Bradshaw]], the Duke's agent. Bradshaw managed the estate, for which he received a salary of \u00a32,000 a year and the use of the duke's mansions at Worsley and Runcorn. The other two trustees had each married nieces of the duke and were \"dummy trustees\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=6}}</ref>\n[[File:BridgewaterCanalTradeFigures.png|left|thumb|400px|Value of trade carried on the Bridgewater Canal 1806\u201371<ref name=mather358>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref>]]\nDuring the time the canal was administered by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year.<ref name=mather358/>  Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of the order of 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent.{{sfn|Mather|1970|p=7|ps=}}  Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a \"formidable bargainer\".{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=10\u201311|ps=}} In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal]] to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed.<ref name=\"Tomlinsonp33\"/> In 1810 there was a general agreement with the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] Company (M&IN) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from \"tonnage traffic\" (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own carriage of freight.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=12\u201315|ps=}} Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will.{{sfnp|Mather|1970|pp=21\u201323|ps=}} There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=17, 20|ps=}}\n\nDuring the 1820s there was increased dissatisfaction with the canals. They did not cope well with increasing volumes of cargo, and they were perceived as monopolistic, and the preserve of the landed gentry class.  There was increased interest in the possibility of railway construction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=27\u201333}}</ref>  The possible construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester was vigorously opposed by Bradshaw, who refused railway surveyors access to land owned by the Trustees.  When the first [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was presented to parliament in 1825, the Trustees opposed and it was overthrown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=36\u201337}}</ref> However, later in the year Lord Stafford, possibly persuaded to do so by [[William Huskisson]], invested \u00a3100,000 (one-fifth of the required capital), in the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].  Following this the Trustees withdrew their opposition to the construction of the railway; they did not petition against the second bill, which was passed in 1826.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=38\u201341}}</ref> At the same time as he made his investment in the railway, Lord Stafford advanced \u00a340,000 for improvements to the canal. This was spent mainly on a second line of locks at Runcorn, which were completed in 1828, plus new warehouses at Manchester and Liverpool.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>  The additional line of locks cost \u00a335,000<ref name=\"Starkeyp179\">{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=179}}</ref> and was used for traffic heading to Manchester, while the old line was used for traffic passing down to the Mersey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=173}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830 the new railway opened and by the end of the year was carrying freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=57\u201361}}</ref> In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a [[stroke]], as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=80\u201382, 85}}</ref>\n\nMatters came to a head in 1833, the year in which the canal made its lowest profit since the death of the Duke.<ref name=mather358/> On 19&nbsp;July the Marquess of Stafford (now the 1st Duke of Sutherland) died and the profits from the canal passed to Francis Egerton. On 25&nbsp;September Bradshaw's son, [[James Bradshaw (MP for Brackley)|Captain James Bradshaw]], who had been acting as a deputy superintendent to the Trustees, and who had been expected to succeed his father as Superintendent, committed suicide. The agent for both Francis Egerton and his older brother, who was now the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|2nd Duke of Sutherland]], was [[James Loch]].<ref name=mather84>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=84\u201386}}</ref>  The events that followed were \"stage-managed by Loch\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=85}}</ref> He reported to Francis Egerton that Bradshaw was no longer fit to be Superintendent, and then persuaded Bradshaw to retire on his full salary. It had been expected that he would appoint his other son, William Rigby Bradshaw, as his successor, but Loch persuaded him to appoint James Sothern in the position; Sothern had been the principal agent of the Trust since December 1832. He took over the position of Superintendent on 3&nbsp;February 1834.<ref name=mather84/>  The appointment of Sothern was not a success. Charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism. He entered into disputes and disagreements with Loch, with Francis Egerton, and with the other two trustees. (Sir Archibald Macdonald had died in 1826; by this time his place had been taken by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|10th Earl of Devon]]). To avoid a costly lawsuit, at the end of 1836 Sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of \u00a345,000. On 1&nbsp;March 1837, he was succeeded as Superintendent by James Loch.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=87\u201397}}</ref>\n\nLoch was extremely busy and did not have time to deal with the detailed administration of the Trust. He therefore looked for a deputy to take on these duties. His first choice was Richard Smith who was the mine agent to the Trustees of the [[John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|1st Earl of Dudley]]. However this was perceived as poaching and it led to such controversy that Smith declined the offer and recommended his son, [[George Samuel Fereday Smith]] for the post. Fereday Smith was appointed as Deputy Superintendent in March 1837 on a salary of \u00a3600 a year, half of the salary which had been offered to his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> Loch immediately undertook a reorganisation of the administration and efficiency of the business,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=100\u2013102}}</ref> restored the agreement with the Old Quay Company to raise freight charges, and improved the facilities for passengers, including the introduction of \"swift boats\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=105\u2013110}}</ref>  By 1837, the Trustees employed around 3,000&nbsp;people (including those working in the colliery and in Worsley Yard), making it one of the largest employers in the country at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> Since the death of the Duke the amount of freight carried by the canal had almost trebled; in 1803 it carried {{convert|334495|LT}} of goods and in 1836 {{convert|968795|LT}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1843 a new dock, the Francis Dock, was opened at Runcorn.<ref name=\"Starkeyp179\"/> The late 1830s and early 1840s had seen increased competition between the Bridgewater Canal on the one hand, and other canal companies and the railways on the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=121\u2013151}}</ref> The most dangerous of the rivals was the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company who started to reduce their rates again in 1840.

This was the period in the mid-1840s known as the [[Railway Mania]].  The railways competed with the canals in three ways; by building, or threatening to build, new lines which would be in direct competition with the canals; by amalgamation into giant companies (such as the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] and the [[London and North Western Railway|London and North Western]] companies), which gave them more political power; and by taking over ownership of canal companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=176\u2013180}}</ref>  On 13&nbsp;April 1844 ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported that the canal was to be emptied of water, and converted into a railway,<ref>{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: The Bridgewater Canal | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&fromDate=1785-01-01&currentPageNumber=1&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=default&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08-015&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=1638&addRefineFilters=&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&next_Page=false&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=1&date_mm_From=01&date_yyyy_From=1785&date_dd_to_range=31&date_mm_to_range=12&date_yyyy_to_range=1985&date_dd_from_precise=1&date_mm_from_precise=01&date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText= |date=13 April 1844|accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London |first1=Rachel |last1=Sylvester |first2=Sam |last2=Coates}}</ref> although nothing came of this scheme.

The Express arrived from Liverpool on Saturday evening; but it was yesterday morning before she began to unload. She is lying in the Bridgewater Canal, Knott Mill where the Duke's trustees have constructed a large bonding vault, which Mr. Gibb has taken and had licensed for the purpose, and we believe he is now removing his stock of wine and spirits from other ports to Manchester, for the greater convenience of sampling and sale. The lockers, gaugers, and other officers of Customs were in attendance, superintending the unloading of the vessel and thus have commenced the operations of the Manchester Custom-house. It is a gratifying circumstance that a gentleman who took so prominent a part in the struggle to obtain the boon of bonding for Manchester should be the first to enjoy the fruits of its success.

Although the system has been introduced into Manchester only as an experiment and a large establishment has been formed entirely of old and experienced officers; under the impression that the extent of business there would require the constant services of well tried men, we believe that, up to the present period, little trade has passed through the Manchester Custom-house and the officers' duties are nearly approaching to a sinecure. The total annual expense of this establishment, exclusive of that for the Custom-house and warehouse is \u00a32,620.

Agreements and alliances were made and broken.  Their major opponents were the London and North Western Railway and the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] who reduced tariffs and took business away from the canals.  For the first time the railways carried more trade between Liverpool and the towns of central Lancashire than the canals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=195\u2013225}}</ref>  The value of the traffic carried by the Bridgewater Canal in 1851 was the lowest in the time it was administered by the Trustees.<ref name=mather358/>  In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted [[Royal visits to Manchester and Salford during the reign of Queen Victoria|a visit to Manchester]] by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].  They stayed at Worsley Hall, with a view of the canal, and were given a trip between [[Patricroft railway station]] and Worsley Hall, on state barges.  Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbett|1974|p=43}}</ref>\n\nThe Trustees spent much time between 1851 and 1855 in negotiations to ease the competition, especially that from the London and North Western Railway.  The most likely allies seemed to be other railway companies, including the [[Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway|Shrewsbury and Birmingham]] and the [[Shrewsbury to Chester Line|Shrewsbury and Chester]] railway companies, and the Great Western Railway.  Of these, the most likely seemed to be the Great Western Railway who, in their concern to expand northwards were willing to help the Trustees with the carriage of their traffic to the south.  However years of negotiations came to no agreement and, in the end, the Trustees' railway deal was done with the London and North Western Railway, who agreed to cooperate with the onward passage of the Trustees' traffic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=226\u2013256}}</ref>\n\nOn 28&nbsp;June 1855 James Loch, the Superintendent, died and was succeeded by [[Algernon Egerton|Hon.

During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845.  With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=268\u2013269}}</ref>  During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=259\u2013267}}</ref>  Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion<ref>{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=260}}</ref> and now his opportunity came.

It is localized to the [[mitochondrial]] inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid [[18-hydroxylase]] activity to synthesize [[aldosterone]] and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the [[zona glomerulosa]] at the outer edge of the [[adrenal cortex]]. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by [[angiotensin II]].\n\nAldosterone causes the [[tubules]] of the [[kidneys]] to retain [[sodium]] and [[water]]. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up [[blood pressure]].\n\nSteroid hormones are synthesized from [[cholesterol]] within the [[adrenal cortex]]. [[Aldosterone]] and [[corticosterone]] share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the [[11\u03b2-hydroxylase]] (for [[corticosterone]]).\n\n:'''[[Steroid metabolism|Aldosterone synthesis]] is stimulated by several factors:'''\n::by increase in the plasma concentration of [[angiotensin III]].\n::by increased plasma [[angiotensin II]], [[ACTH]], or [[potassium]] levels.\n::The [[ACTH stimulation test]] is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with [[cortisol]] to determine if primary or secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]] is present.\n::by plasma [[acidosis]].\n::by the [[Mechanoreceptors|stretch receptors]] located in the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] of the [[heart]].\n::by [[adrenoglomerulotropin]], a [[lipid]] factor, obtained from [[pineal]] extracts.

It is localized to the [[mitochondrial]] inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid [[18-hydroxylase]] activity to synthesize [[aldosterone]] and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the [[zona glomerulosa]] at the outer edge of the [[adrenal cortex]]. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by [[angiotensin II]].\n\nAldosterone causes the [[tubules]] of the [[kidneys]] to retain [[sodium]] and [[water]]. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up [[blood pressure]].\n\nSteroid hormones are synthesized from [[cholesterol]] within the [[adrenal cortex]]. [[Aldosterone]] and [[corticosterone]] share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the [[11\u03b2-hydroxylase]] (for [[corticosterone]]).\n\n:'''[[Steroid metabolism|Aldosterone synthesis]] is stimulated by several factors:'''\n::by increase in the plasma concentration of [[angiotensin III]].\n::by increased plasma [[angiotensin II]], [[ACTH]], or [[potassium]] levels.\n::The [[ACTH stimulation test]] is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with [[cortisol]] to determine if primary or secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]] is present.\n::by plasma [[acidosis]].\n::by the [[Mechanoreceptors|stretch receptors]] located in the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] of the [[heart]].\n::by [[adrenoglomerulotropin]], a [[lipid]] factor, obtained from [[pineal]] extracts.

Owing to domestic unhappiness he was brought up from the age of four by his grandfather, Charles Wellbeloved (1713\u20131782), a country gentleman at [[Mortlake]], Surrey, an Anglican, and the friend and follower of [[John Wesley]]. He got the best part of his early education from a clergyman named Delafosse at Richmond.  In 1783 he was placed with a firm of drapers on Holborn Hill, but only learned \"how to tie up a parcel\".\n\nIn 1785 he became a student at [[Homerton Academy]] under Benjamin Davies.  Among his fellow-students were [[William Field (Unitarian minister)|William Field]] and David Jones (1765\u20131816).  Jones was expelled for heresy in 1786; his opinions had influenced Wellbeloved, who was allowed to finish the session of 1787, but not to return.  In September 1787 he followed Jones to New College, Hackney, under [[Abraham Rees]], the cyclop\u00e6dist, and [[Andrew Kippis]], and subsequently (1789) under [[Thomas Belsham]] and (1790) [[Gilbert Wakefield]].  Here he formed a close friendship with [[Arthur Aikin]], who entered in 1789.  He attended the ministry of [[Richard Price]] (1723\u20131791).  \n\nHe married his wife Ann Kinder (d. 31 January 1823) on 1 July 1793, at St. Mary's, [[Stoke Newington]], with whom he had several children. Their youngest son, [[Robert Wellbeloved]] (15 July 1803&nbsp;\u2013 21 February 1856), married heiress Sarah Scott on 17 February 1830 and assumed the name and arms of Scott on her father's death in 1832.  Robert was a deputy-lieutenant for [[Worcestershire]] and M.P. for [[Walsall]] (1841\u201346).<ref name=\"DNB00\" /> His youngest daughter, Emma (d. 29 July 1842), married (1831) [[James Carter (judge)|Sir James Carter]], chief justice of New Brunswick.<ref name=\"MacNutt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4883|title=Carter, Sir James|last=MacNutt|first=William Stewart|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, vol. 10|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Ecclesiastical career===\nWellbeloved's first sermon was preached at [[Walthamstow]] on 13 November 1791.  Shortly afterwards he received through Michael Maurice, father of [John] [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], an invitation to become assistant to [[Newcome Cappe]] at [[York Unitarian Chapel|St Saviourgate Chapel]], [[York]].  He accepted on 23 January 1792, and began his duties at York on 5 February.  In 1801 he became sole minister on Cappe's death. The chief feature of his [[exegetical]] work was his treatment of prophecy, limiting the range of its prediction, confining that of Hebrew prophecy to the age of its production, and bounding our Lord's predictions by the destruction of Jerusalem. He broke with the Priestley school, rejecting a general resurrection and fixing the last judgment at death. In these and other points he closely followed the system of [[Newcome Cappe]], but his careful avoidance of dogmatism left his pupils free, and none of them followed him into \u2018Cappism.\u2019 Among his coadjutors were [[Theophilus Browne]], [[William Turner (biographer)|William Turner]]<ref>see [[William Turner (1714\u20131794)]]</ref> and William Hincks.<ref>[see under , [[Robert Dix Hincks]]]</ref> From 1810 he had the invaluable co-operation of [[John Kenrick (historian)|John Kenrick]], who married his elder daughter L\u00e6titia.\n\nIn 1794 he began to take pupils into a Sunday school he had founded. He was invited in November 1797 (after Belsham had declined) to succeed [[Thomas Barnes (Unitarian)|Thomas Barnes]] (1747\u20131810) as divinity tutor in the Manchester academy.  Barnes, an evangelical Arian, gave him no encouragement, but he did not reject the offer till February 1798; it was accepted soon after by [[George Walker (Presbyterian)|George Walker]]. On Walker's resignation the trustees proposed (25 March 1803) to remove the institution to York if Wellbeloved would become its director.  He agreed (11 April), and from September 1803 to June 1840 the institution was known as Manchester College, York, which eventually became [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford]].  Its management was retained by a committee, meeting ordinarily in Manchester.  For thirty-seven years Wellbeloved discharged the duties of the divinity chair in a spirit described by [[James Martineau|Dr. James Martineau]], his pupil, as \"candid and catholic, simple and thorough\".  He followed the method which [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Richard Watson]] (1737\u20131816) had introduced at Cambridge, discarding systematic theology and substituting biblical exegesis.\n\nPresentations of plate (1840) and of 1,000''l'' (1843) were made to him on resigning his divinity chair.  He retained his connection with his chapel until his death, officiating occasionally until 1853, having as assistants John Wright (1845\u201346) and Henry Vaughan Palmer (1846\u201358).  He died at his residence, Monkgate, York, on 29 August 1858, and was buried (3 September) in the graveyard of St.Saviourgate Chapel; a memorial tablet is in the chapel.

The prospectus (May 1814) announced a revised translation with commentary. Between 1819 and 1838 nine parts were issued in large quarto, containing the Pentateuch, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. The text was reprinted, with Wellbeloved's revised version of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and the Minor Prophets, in \u2018The Holy Scriptures of the Old Covenant,\u2019 1859\u201362, 3 vols. 8vo. In 1823 he took up a controversy, begun by Thomas Thrush (1761\u20131843), with [[Francis Wrangham]] [[Sydney Smith]] wrote: \"If I had a cause to gain I would fee Mr. Wellbeloved to plead for me, and double fee Mr. Wrangham to plead against me.\" As a sub-trustee of the [[Sarah Hewley Trust]] he was involved in the suit (1830\u201342) which removed Unitarians from its management and benefits.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the York Subscription Library (1794), the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]] (1822), and the York Institute (1827), and devoted much time to the archaeology of [[York]].

Robert was a deputy-lieutenant for [[Worcestershire]] and M.P. for [[Walsall]] (1841\u201346).<ref name=\"DNB00\" /> His youngest daughter, Emma (d. 29 July 1842), married (1831) [[James Carter (judge)|Sir James Carter]], chief justice of New Brunswick.<ref name=\"MacNutt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4883|title=Carter, Sir James|last=MacNutt|first=William Stewart|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, vol. 10|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Ecclesiastical career===\nWellbeloved's first sermon was preached at [[Walthamstow]] on 13 November 1791.  Shortly afterwards he received through Michael Maurice, father of [John] [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], an invitation to become assistant to [[Newcome Cappe]] at [[York Unitarian Chapel|St Saviourgate Chapel]], [[York]].  He accepted on 23 January 1792, and began his duties at York on 5 February.  In 1801 he became sole minister on Cappe's death. The chief feature of his [[exegetical]] work was his treatment of prophecy, limiting the range of its prediction, confining that of Hebrew prophecy to the age of its production, and bounding our Lord's predictions by the destruction of Jerusalem. He broke with the Priestley school, rejecting a general resurrection and fixing the last judgment at death. In these and other points he closely followed the system of [[Newcome Cappe]], but his careful avoidance of dogmatism left his pupils free, and none of them followed him into \u2018Cappism.\u2019 Among his coadjutors were [[Theophilus Browne]], [[William Turner (biographer)|William Turner]]<ref>see [[William Turner (1714\u20131794)]]</ref> and William Hincks.<ref>[see under , [[Robert Dix Hincks]]]</ref> From 1810 he had the invaluable co-operation of [[John Kenrick (historian)|John Kenrick]], who married his elder daughter L\u00e6titia.\n\nIn 1794 he began to take pupils into a Sunday school he had founded. He was invited in November 1797 (after Belsham had declined) to succeed [[Thomas Barnes (Unitarian)|Thomas Barnes]] (1747\u20131810) as divinity tutor in the Manchester academy.  Barnes, an evangelical Arian, gave him no encouragement, but he did not reject the offer till February 1798; it was accepted soon after by [[George Walker (Presbyterian)|George Walker]]. On Walker's resignation the trustees proposed (25 March 1803) to remove the institution to York if Wellbeloved would become its director.  He agreed (11 April), and from September 1803 to June 1840 the institution was known as Manchester College, York, which eventually became [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford]].  Its management was retained by a committee, meeting ordinarily in Manchester.  For thirty-seven years Wellbeloved discharged the duties of the divinity chair in a spirit described by [[James Martineau|Dr. James Martineau]], his pupil, as \"candid and catholic, simple and thorough\".  He followed the method which [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Richard Watson]] (1737\u20131816) had introduced at Cambridge, discarding systematic theology and substituting biblical exegesis.\n\nPresentations of plate (1840) and of 1,000''l'' (1843) were made to him on resigning his divinity chair.  He retained his connection with his chapel until his death, officiating occasionally until 1853, having as assistants John Wright (1845\u201346) and Henry Vaughan Palmer (1846\u201358).  He died at his residence, Monkgate, York, on 29 August 1858, and was buried (3 September) in the graveyard of St.Saviourgate Chapel; a memorial tablet is in the chapel.  His portrait, painted in 1826 by [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]],<!--  was in the possession of G. W. Rayner Wood at Singleton Lodge, Manchester; copies are in the museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and the vestry of St. Saviourgate Chapel; --> was engraved by [[Samuel Cousins]].<ref name=\"DNB00\" />\n\n===Antiquarian===\nWellbeloved was the Honorary Curator of Antiquities for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society from 1823 until his death in 1858, overseeing the exhibition and interpretation of antiquities in the [[Yorkshire Museum]] from its opening in 1830.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Philosophers and Provincials: The Yorkshire Philosophical Society from 1822 to 1844 |author1=Orange, A.

The prospectus (May 1814) announced a revised translation with commentary. Between 1819 and 1838 nine parts were issued in large quarto, containing the Pentateuch, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. The text was reprinted, with Wellbeloved's revised version of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and the Minor Prophets, in \u2018The Holy Scriptures of the Old Covenant,\u2019 1859\u201362, 3 vols. 8vo. In 1823 he took up a controversy, begun by Thomas Thrush (1761\u20131843), with [[Francis Wrangham]] [[Sydney Smith]] wrote: \"If I had a cause to gain I would fee Mr. Wellbeloved to plead for me, and double fee Mr. Wrangham to plead against me.\" As a sub-trustee of the [[Sarah Hewley Trust]] he was involved in the suit (1830\u201342) which removed Unitarians from its management and benefits.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the York Subscription Library (1794), the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]] (1822), and the York Institute (1827), and devoted much time to the archaeology of [[York]]. His archaeological work included excavation in advance of the construction of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131020154947/http://www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk/Page/Index.aspx Yorkshire Museum and Gardens], the history of which is published in A Handbook to the Antiquties in the Grounds and Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wellbeloved|first=Charles|title=A Handbook to the Antiquities in the Grounds and Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society|year=1881|publisher=J.

He was a trustee of the [[Johns Hopkins University]], who funded research. In 1877 Baker married Elizabeth Elton Livzey. In 1889 Baker incorporated the [[Atlantic Transport Line]] in London, and chose to start construction of the Ingleside Mansion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Atlantic Transport Line, 1881-1931 A History with Details on All Ships|author=Jonathan Kinghorn|page=244}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion was built on {{convert|300|acre}} of property that Baker inherited and an adjoining parcel he purchased. The building was based on an English home, with 49 rooms. The outside was clad in fieldstone. The roof was red tile. Fireplace mantles were hand carved. Several tenant houses and a formal garden were built on the property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beautiful Gardens in America|author=Louise Shelton|page=218}}</ref> A world traveler, Baker described Ingleside as his only true home.\n\nIn April 1918, the Bakers turned the mansion over to Company C of the food production committee of the women's section of the Maryland defense council to support the war efforts. Women farmers would tend crops for $1.20 a day, compared to the going rate of $2.00 a day for male labor. There was some resistance in the community to using women laborers. Governor [[Emerson Harrington]] gave a speech at the mansion porch in support of the efforts in July 1918.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fruits of Victory: The Woman's Land Army of America in the Great War|author=Elaine F.

He was a trustee of the [[Johns Hopkins University]], who funded research. In 1877 Baker married Elizabeth Elton Livzey. In 1889 Baker incorporated the [[Atlantic Transport Line]] in London, and chose to start construction of the Ingleside Mansion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Atlantic Transport Line, 1881-1931 A History with Details on All Ships|author=Jonathan Kinghorn|page=244}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion was built on {{convert|300|acre}} of property that Baker inherited and an adjoining parcel he purchased. The building was based on an English home, with 49 rooms. The outside was clad in fieldstone. The roof was red tile. Fireplace mantles were hand carved. Several tenant houses and a formal garden were built on the property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beautiful Gardens in America|author=Louise Shelton|page=218}}</ref> A world traveler, Baker described Ingleside as his only true home.\n\nIn April 1918, the Bakers turned the mansion over to Company C of the food production committee of the women's section of the Maryland defense council to support the war efforts. Women farmers would tend crops for $1.20 a day, compared to the going rate of $2.00 a day for male labor. There was some resistance in the community to using women laborers. Governor [[Emerson Harrington]] gave a speech at the mansion porch in support of the efforts in July 1918.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fruits of Victory: The Woman's Land Army of America in the Great War|author=Elaine F.

Originally, SLOS patients were classified into two categories (classic and severe) based on physical and mental characteristics, alongside other clinical features. Since the discovery of the specific biochemical defect responsible for SLOS, patients are given a severity score based on their levels of cerebral, ocular, oral, and genital defects. It is then used to classify patients as having mild, classical, or severe SLOS.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\n===Physical characteristics===\n\nThe most common facial features of SLOS include [[microcephaly]], bitemporal narrowing (reduced distance between temples), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], a short and upturned nose, [[micrognathism|micrognathia]], [[epicanthic fold|epicanthal folds]], and [[hemangioma|capillary hemangioma]] of the nose.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" /> Other physical characteristics include:\n\n[[File:Feets with partial simple syndactyly.jpg|350px|thumb|Syndactyly of the second and third toes]]\n\n*low-set and posteriorly rotated ears\n*high-arched, narrow, hard palate\n*[[Cleft lip and palate|cleft lip/palate]]\n*[[agenesis of the corpus callosum|agenesis]] or [[hypoplasia]] of the [[corpus callosum]]\n*cerebellar [[hypoplasia]]\n*increased [[ventricular system|ventricular]] size\n*decreased [[frontal lobe]] size\n*[[polydactyly]] of hands or feet\n*short, proximally placed thumb\n*other finger malformations\n*[[syndactyly]] of second and third toes\n*ambiguous or female-like male genitalia\n*congenital heart defects\n*renal, pulmonary, liver and eye abnormalities\n\n===Behavioural characteristics===\n\nCertain behaviours and attributes are commonly seen among patients suffering from SLOS. They may have low normal intelligence, and react negatively or with hypersensitivity to different sensory stimuli. This is particularly true for certain auditory and visual stimuli. Many patients show aggressiveness and [[self-harm|self-injurious]] behaviours, and sleep disturbances are common.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" /> Specific behaviours resembling those of people with [[autism]] are often present as well as [[hyperactivity]], which provides genetic and biological insights into autism spectrum disorders. The autistic behaviours most characteristic of SLOS patients are opisthokinesis (an upper body movement), stretching of the upper body, and hand flicking.<ref name=\"ASD Met\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2013.05.013 |title=Autism Spectrum Disorders and Inborn Errors of Metabolism: An Update |year=2013 |last1=Ghaziuddin |first1=Mohammad |last2=Al-Owain |first2=Mohammed |journal=Pediatric Neurology |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=232\u20136 |pmid=23921282}}</ref> Autism is typically diagnosed separately from SLOS using the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-V]], and approximately 50\u201375% of SLOS patients meet the criteria for autism.<ref name=AutCaseStud>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07020315 |title=Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder |year=2007 |last1=Bukelis |first1=I. |last2=Porter |first2=F.

For example, infants often show feeding problems or feeding intolerance, and patients may require increased caloric intake due to accelerated metabolism. Recurrent infections, including ear infections and pneumonia, are also common.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\n===Biochemical phenotype===\n\nGiven that SLOS is caused by a mutation in an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, the resulting biochemical characteristics may be predictable. Most patients have lowered plasma cholesterol levels ([[hypocholesterolemia]]). However, approximately 10% may show normal cholesterol levels,<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />  and decreased concentrations of cholesterol are not solely indicative of SLOS. Increased levels of cholesterol precursors are also common in SLOS. In particular, elevated levels of [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] are fairly specific to SLOS.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />\n==Genetics==\n\n===DHCR7===\n\nThe gene encoding [[7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase|DHCR7]] (labeled as ''DHCR7'') was cloned in 1998, and has been mapped to [[chromosome 11|chromosome 11q12-13]].<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> It is 14100 [[base pair]]s of DNA in length, and contains nine [[exon]]s,<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> the corresponding [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] is 2786 base pairs in length (the remaining DNA sequence is intronic). The structure of the ''DHCR7'' rat gene is very similar to the structure of the human gene.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe highest levels of ''DHCR7'' [[gene expression|expression]] have been detected in the adrenal gland, the testis, the liver and in brain tissue.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Its expression is induced by decreased [[sterol]] concentrations via sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBP). There is also evidence that its activity may be regulated by tissue specific transcription, and [[alternative splicing]].\n\nAs outlined above, the enzyme DHCR7 catalyzes the reduction of 7DHC to cholesterol, as well as the reduction of 7-dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol. It requires NADPH as a cofactor for this reduction, and may involve the activity of [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase]]. It is also thought to contain iron.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> DHCR7 is an [[integral membrane protein]] of the endoplasmic reticulum, and computer models have predicted up to nine [[transmembrane domain]]s.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> DHCR7 is most efficient at reducing 7DHC, but it is known to reduce the carbon 7 double bond of other sterols, indicating a range of [[enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] [[specificity constant|specificity]]. The human version of this enzyme is predicted to have a [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 54,489 [[atomic mass unit|kDa]], and an [[isoelectric point]] of 9.05.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe [[amino acid]] sequence that encodes DHCR7 is predicted to contain 475 amino acids, as well as several [[sequence motif|protein motifs]]. It contains multiple sterol reductase motifs, as would be expected given its function. It contains a potential sterol-sensing domain (SSD), whose function is unknown but thought to be necessary for binding sterol substrates. It also includes multiple sites of phosphorylation, including potential [[protein kinase C]] and [[tyrosine kinase]] sites (regulatory enzymes responsible for phosphorylation). The exact function of phosphorylating DHCR7 is yet unknown, but it is thought to be involved in the regulation of its activity.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\n===Mutations and incidence===\n[[File:Missense Mutation Example.jpg|thumb|400px|Missense mutations account for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum]]\nSLOS is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive trait|recessive]] disorder.<ref name=insight>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00515.x |title=Recent insights into the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome |year=2005 |last1=Yu |first1=H |last2=Patel |first2=SB |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=383\u201391 |pmid=16207203 |pmc=1350989}}</ref> More than 130 different types of mutations have been identified.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />  [[Missense mutation]]s (single nucleotide change resulting in a code for a different amino acid) are the most common, accounting for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum. These typically reduce the function of the enzyme but may not inhibit it completely. Much depends on the nature of the mutation (i.e. which amino acid is replaced and where). [[Null allele|Null mutations]] are much less common, these mutations produce either a completely dysfunctional enzyme, or no enzyme at all.<ref name=insight /> Thus, missense mutations may be more common overall because they are less lethal than nonsense mutations; nonsense mutations may simply result in [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]].\n\nThe IVS8-1G>C is the most frequently reported mutation in ''DHCR7''. This disrupts the joining of exons eight and nine, and results in the insertion of 134 [[nucleotide]]s into the ''DHCR7'' transcript. This is a nonsense mutation, thus patients that are [[zygosity|homozygous]] for this allele are severely affected. It is thought that this mutation first occurred in the [[British Isles]], and it has a [[genetic carrier|carrier]] (those that are [[zygosity|heterozygous]] for the allele but not affected) frequency of 1.09% for Caucasians of European heritage. The frequency of mutations differs for various ethnicities, depending on the origin of the mutation. In all Caucasian populations, this particular mutation has an estimated carrier frequency of 3%.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe next most common mutation is 278C>T, and results in a [[threonine]] at the amino acid position 93. It is a missense mutation and tends to be associated with less severe symptoms. This mutation is the most common one seen in patients of Italian, Cuban, and Mediterranean descent.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe third most common mutation is  452G>A. This [[nonsense mutation]] causes protein termination, such that the enzyme DHCR7 would not be formed. It is thought to have arisen in Southern Poland and is most common in Northern Europe.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nOther mutations are less common, although appear to target certain protein domains more so than others. For example, the sterol reductase motifs are common sites of mutation.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Overall, there is an estimated carrier frequency (for any DHCR7 mutation causing SLOS) of 3-4% in Caucasian populations (it is less frequent among Asian and African populations<ref name=\"irons1998\">{{cite book |last=Nowaczyk |first=Malgorzata JM |chapter=Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1143/ |title=GeneReviews |publisher=National Library of Medicine |date=June 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |editor1-first=Roberta A |editor1-last=Pagon |editor2-first=Margaret P |editor2-last=Adam |editor3-first=Thomas D |editor3-last=Bird |editor4-first=Cynthia R |editor4-last=Dolan |editor5-first=Chin-To |editor5-last=Fong |editor6-first=Richard JH |editor6-last=Smith |editor7-first=Karen |editor7-last=Stephens}}</ref>). This number indicates a hypothetical birth [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] between 1/2500 and 1/4500. However, the measured incidence is between 1/10,000 to 1/60,000 (it differs depending on heritage and descent).<ref name=insight /> This is much lower than expected. This indicates that many cases of SLOS are undetected, and is likely due to either spontaneous abortion caused by severe mutations (miscarriage), or mild cases that are undiagnosed. Females lack the characteristic genital malformations that affected males have, and thus are less likely to be correctly diagnosed.<ref name=\"irons1998\" />\n\n==Cholesterol metabolism and function==\n\n===Metabolism===\n\nCholesterol can be obtained through the diet, but it can also be formed by metabolism in the body.

In another pathway leading to cholesterol synthesis, DHCR7 is required for the reduction of [[7-Dehydrodesmosterol]] to [[desmosterol]].\n\n===Regulation===\n\nRegulation of cholesterol synthesis is complex and occurs primarily through the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (catalyst of the rate-limiting step). It involves a [[feedback]] loop that is sensitive to cellular levels of cholesterol. The four main steps of [[regulation of gene expression|regulation]] are:<ref name=biochembook />\n\n* The synthesis of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). This is a [[transcription factor]] that is inactive when cholesterol levels are high, and active when cholesterol levels are low. When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the [[nuclear membrane]] or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], it then migrates to the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and causes the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the HMG-CoA reductase [[gene]].\n* The [[translation (biology)|translation]] (creating the enzyme from the mRNA transcript) of HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by derivatives of mevalonate and by dietary cholesterol.\n* The degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is tightly controlled. The part of the enzyme that is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum senses signals, such as increased cholesterol levels, that lead to its degradation or [[proteolysis]].\n* When HMG-CoA reductase is [[phophorylation|phosphorylated]], its activity decreases. This means cholesterol synthesis is reduced when cell energy (ATP) levels are low.\n\n===Function===\n\nCholesterol is an important [[lipid]] involved in metabolism, cell function, and structure. It is a structural component of the [[cell membrane]],<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> such that it provides structure and regulates the [[membrane fluidity|fluidity]] of the [[lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]]. Furthermore, cholesterol is a constituent in [[lipid raft]]s. These are congregations of [[protein]]s and lipids (including [[sphingolipid]]s and cholesterol) that float within the cell membrane, and play a role in the regulation of membrane function. Lipid rafts are more ordered or rigid than the membrane bilayer surrounding them. Their involvement in regulation stems mostly from their association with proteins; upon binding substrates, some proteins have a higher affinity for attaching to lipid rafts. This brings them in close proximity with other proteins, allowing them to affect [[signal transduction|signaling pathways]]. Cholesterol specifically acts as a spacer and a glue for lipid rafts; absence of cholesterol leads to the dissociation of proteins.<ref name=Lipidraft>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI16390 |title=Cholesterol, lipid rafts, and disease |year=2002 |last1=Simons |first1=Kai |last2=Ehehalt |first2=Robert |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=597\u2013603 |pmid=12208858 |pmc=151114}}</ref>\n\nGiven its prevalence in cell membranes, cholesterol is highly involved in certain [[membrane transport|transport]] processes. It may influence the function of [[ion channel]]s and other membrane transporters. For example, cholesterol is necessary for the [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] binding activity of the [[serotonin]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].<ref name=serotonin>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.04.135 |title=Differential effects of cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol on the ligand binding activity of the hippocampal serotonin1A receptor: Implications in SLOS |year=2007 |last1=Singh |first1=Pushpendra |last2=Paila |first2=Yamuna Devi |last3=Chattopadhyay |first3=Amitabha |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=358 |issue=2 |pages=495\u20139 |pmid=17493586}}</ref> In addition, it appears to be very important in [[exocytosis]]. Cholesterol modulates the properties of the membrane (such as membrane curvature), and may regulate the fusion of [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] with the cell membrane. It may also facilitate the recruitment of complexes necessary for exocytosis. Given that [[neuron]]s rely heavily on exocytosis for the transmission of [[action potential|impulses]], cholesterol is a very important part of the [[nervous system]].<ref name=vesicle>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jcs.060681 |title=Cholesterol reduction impairs exocytosis of synaptic vesicles |year=2010 |last1=Linetti |first1=A. |last2=Fratangeli |first2=A. |last3=Taverna |first3=E. |last4=Valnegri |first4=P. |last5=Francolini |first5=M. |last6=Cappello |first6=V. |last7=Matteoli |first7=M. |last8=Passafaro |first8=M. |last9=Rosa |first9=P. |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=595\u2013605 |pmid=20103534 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cholesterolfunction.jpg|thumb|400px|Functions and derivatives of cholesterol.]]\nOne particularly relevant pathway in which cholesterol takes place is the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway]]. This pathway is very important during [[human embryogenesis|embryonic development]], and involved in deciding the fate of cells (i.e., which tissue they need to migrate to). Hedgehog proteins are also involved in the transcription of genes that regulate cell [[cell growth|proliferation]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Cholesterol is important to this pathway because it undergoes [[covalent bond]]ing to Hedgehog proteins, resulting in their activation. Without cholesterol, the signaling activity is disrupted and cell differentiation may be impaired.<ref name=Hedgehog>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.050 |title=Hedgehog signalling |year=2008 |last1=Ingham |first1=Philip W. |journal=Current Biology |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=R238\u201341 |pmid=18364223}}</ref>\n\nCholesterol is a precursor for many important molecules. These include [[bile acid]]s (important in processing dietary fats), [[oxysterols]], [[neuroactive steroid|neurosteroids]] (involved in neurotransmission and excitation), [[glucocorticoid]]s (involved in immune and inflammatory processes), [[mineralocorticoid]]s (osmotic balance), and [[sex steroid]]s (i.e. [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone]]; wide range of function but involved in genital development prenatally).<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Finally, cholesterol is a major component of [[myelin]], a protective layer around neurons. Myelination occurs most rapidly during prenatal development, meaning that the demand for cholesterol biosynthesis is very high.<ref name=\"Imaging\" />\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n\nGiven that the function of [[cholesterol]] encompasses a very wide range, it is unlikely that the symptoms of SLOS are due to a single molecular mechanism. Some of the molecular effects are yet unknown, but could be extrapolated based on the role of cholesterol. In general, the negative effects are due to decreased levels of cholesterol and increased levels of cholesterol precursors-most notably, [[7-Dehydrocholesterol|7DHC]]. Although 7DHC is structurally similar to cholesterol, and could potentially act as a substitute, the effects of this are still being studied.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />\n\nMost patients with SLOS present decreased cholesterol levels, particularly in the brain (where cholesterol levels rely primarily on new synthesis). This also means that any sterol derivatives of cholesterol would also have reduced concentrations. For example, reduced levels of [[neuractive steroid|neurosteroids]] may be seen in SLOS. These are lipids which take part in signaling within the brain, and must be produced within the brain itself. They are responsible for interacting with [[nuclear receptor|nuclear steroid receptors]], and bind to [[neurotransmitter]]-gated ion channels. Specifically, they modulate the effects of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptors, resulting in calming effects, improved memory, and more. Thus, given that some characteristics of SLOS are the opposite of these effects (hyperactivity, anxiety), a reduction in neurosteroids could influence both neurological development and behaviour.<ref name=neurosteroid>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.steroids.2003.09.013 |title=The implications of 7-dehydrosterol-7-reductase deficiency (Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome) to neurosteroid production |year=2004 |last1=Marcos |first1=Josep |last2=Guo |first2=Li-Wei |last3=Wilson |first3=William K |last4=Porter |first4=Forbes D |last5=Shackleton |first5=Cedric |journal=Steroids |volume=69 |pages=51\u201360 |pmid=14715377 |issue=1}}</ref>\n[[File:PathogenesisSLOS.png|thumb|right|500px|Pathogenesis of Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome.]]\nFurthermore, as outlined above, cholesterol is an important aspect in Hedgehog signaling. With lower levels of cholesterol, hedgehog proteins would not undergo the necessary covalent modification and subsequent activation. This would result in impaired embryonic development, and may contribute to the observed physical [[congenital disorder|birth defects]] in SLOS. One particular hedgehog signaling protein, [[sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), is important in the pattern of the central nervous system, facial features, and limbs.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> Other hedghehog proteins may be involved in the development of the genital tract and the skeleon.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\nThe altered sterol levels in SLOS are particularly relevant to cell membranes, which are made primarily of lipids.

It also increases the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis). 7DHC leads to novel [[oxysterol]] and [[steroid]] derivatives, and many of their functions or effects are yet unknown.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> A very important finding with respect to 7DHC is that it is the most reactive lipid for [[lipid peroxidation]], and results in systemic [[oxidative stress]]. Lipid peroxidation is known to destroy membranes of both cells and membrane-bound [[organelle]]s. The derivative of 7DHC that is used to indicate oxidative stress is 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-dihydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO); it is formed from a primary product of 7DHC peroxidation, 7-DHC-5\u03b1,6\u03b1-epoxide.

Normal [[ultraviolet|UVA]] exposure may lead to oxidative stress in skin cells. Given that 7DHC is more readily oxidized, it enhances the effects of UVA, leading to increased membrane lipid oxidation and increased production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).<ref name=UVA />\n\nTypically, more altered the levels of 7DHC and cholesterol lead to more severe symptoms of SLOS. The levels of these metabolites also correspond to the severity of the mutation (nonsense versus missense); some mutations of DHCR7 may still show residual cholesterol synthesis, and others may not. However, even individuals with the same mutations or genotype may still show variability in their symptoms. This may be due to maternal factors, such as the transfer of cholesterol to the fetus during pregnancy, as well as the amount of cholesterol present in the brain before the blood\u2013brain barrier forms prenatally. The rate of accumulation and [[excretion]] of toxic metabolites may vary from person to person. Maternal [[apolipoprotein E]] has also been implicated in individual variability in SLOS, although the exact nature of this relationship is unknown.<ref name=insight /> There are likely more factors contributing to the wide spectrum of effects in SLOS which have not yet been discovered.\n\n==Screening and diagnosis==\n\n===Prenatally===\n\nThe most characteristic biochemical indicator of SLOS is an increased concentration of [[7-dehydrocholesterol|7DHC]] (reduced [[cholesterol]] levels are also typical, but appear in other disorders as well). Thus, [[prenatal diagnosis|prenatally]], SLOS is diagnosed upon finding an elevated 7DHC:total sterol ratio in fetal tissues, or increased levels of 7DHC in [[amniotic fluid]]. The 7DHC:total sterol ratio can be measured at 11\u201312 weeks of [[gestation]] by [[chorionic villus sampling]], and elevated 7DHC in amniotic fluid can be measured by 13 weeks. Furthermore, if parental mutations are known, DNA testing of amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples may be performed.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n[[File:Chorionic villi - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Micrograph showing chorionic vili, the tissue that is collected with chorionic villus sampling and used to test for SLOS.]]\n[[Amniocentesis]] (process of sampling amniotic fluid) and chorionic villus sampling cannot be performed until approximately 3 months into the pregnancy. Given that SLOS is a very severe syndrome, parents may want to choose to terminate their pregnancy if their fetus is affected. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling leave very little time to make this decision (abortions become more difficult as the pregnancy advances), and can also pose severe risks to the mother and baby. Thus, there is a very large desire for noninvasive midgestation diagnostic tests.<ref name=midgestation>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0039-128X(99)00026-4 |title=Midgestational maternal urine steroid markers of fetal Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz (SLO) syndrome (7-dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase deficiency) |year=1999 |last1=Shackleton |first1=C |journal=Steroids |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=446\u201352 |pmid=10443900 |last2=Roitman |first2=E |last3=Kratz |first3=LE |last4=Kelley |first4=RI}}</ref> Examining the concentrations of [[sterol]]s in maternal urine is one potential way to identify SLOS prenatally. During pregnancy, the fetus is solely responsible for synthesizing the cholesterol needed to produce [[estriol]]. A fetus with SLOS cannot produce cholesterol, and may use 7DHC or 8DHC as precursors for estriol instead. This creates 7- or 8-dehydrosteroids (such as 7-dehydroestriol), which may show up in the maternal urine. These are novel metabolites due to the presence of a normally reduced [[double bond]] at carbon 7 (caused by the inactivity of DHCR7), and may be used as indicators of SLOS.<ref name=pregmouse>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.04.011 |title=Steroid production and excretion by the pregnant mouse, particularly in relation to pregnancies with fetuses deficient in \u03947-sterol reductase (Dhcr7), the enzyme associated with Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome |year=2009 |last1=Matabosch |first1=Xavier |last2=Rahman |first2=Mahbuba |last3=Hughes |first3=Beverly |last4=Patel |first4=Shailendra B. |last5=Watson |first5=Gordon |last6=Shackleton |first6=Cedric |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=116 |pages=61\u201370 |pmid=19406241 |issue=1\u20132 |pmc=2929956}}</ref> Other cholesterol derivatives which possess a double bond at the 7th or 8th position and are present in maternal urine may also be indicators of SLOS. 7- and 8-dehydropregnanetriols have been shown to be present in the urine of mothers with an affected fetus but not with an unaffected fetus, and thus are used in diagnosis.

This is a simple [[colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetric]] assay developed with the intention of use for large scale screening. When treated with the LB reagent, SLOS samples turn pink immediately and gradually become blue; normal blood samples are initially colorless and develop a faint blue color. Although this method has limitations and is not used to give a definitive diagnosis, it has appeal in that it is a much faster method than using cell cultures.<ref name=LB>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0009-3084(01)00205-5 |title=A colorimetric assay for 7-dehydrocholesterol with potential application to screening for Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome |year=2002 |last1=Xiong |first1=Quanbo |last2=Ruan |first2=Benfang |last3=Whitby |first3=Frank G. |last4=Tuohy |first4=Richard P. |last5=Belanger |first5=Thomas L. |last6=Kelley |first6=Richard I. |last7=Wilson |first7=William K. |last8=Schroepfer |first8=George J. |journal=Chemistry and Physics of Lipids |volume=115 |pages=1\u201315 |pmid=12047895 |issue=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of detecting 7DHC is through [[gas chromatography]], a technique used to separate and analyze compounds.

Given that this [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, inhibiting it would reduce the buildup of toxic metabolites such as 7DHC.<ref name=residual /> [[Simvastatin]] is a known inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and most importantly is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.

Simvastatin increases the [[gene expression|expression]] of ''DHCR7'', likely leading to increased activity of DHCR7. It has also been shown to increase the expression of other genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. However, these benefits are dependent on the amount of residual cholesterol synthesis. Because some individuals possess less severe mutations and demonstrate some amount of DCHR7 activity, these people benefit the most from simvastatin therapy as they still have a partially functioning enzyme. For individuals that show no residual DCHR7 activity, such as those [[zygosity|homozygous]] for null alleles or mutations, simvastatin therapy may actually be toxic.<ref name=residual /> This highlights the importance of identifying the specific [[genotype]] of the SLOS patient before administering treatment. It is still unknown if simvastatin will improve the behavioural or learning deficits in SLOS.<ref name=mousesimvastatin />\n\n===Antioxidant supplementation===\n\n[[Antioxidant]]s are those which inhibit the oxidation of molecules or reduce metabolites that were previously oxidized. Given that some symptoms of SLOS are thought to result from the [[lipid peroxidation|peroxidation]] of 7DHC and its derivatives, inhibiting this peroxidation would likely have beneficial effects. Antioxidants have been shown to increase the level of lipid transcripts in SLOS cells, these transcripts play a role in lipid (cholesterol) biosynthesis and are known to be down-regulated in SLOS. Furthermore, [[vitamin E]] specifically is known to decrease DHCEO levels, which is an indicator of [[oxidative stress]] in SLOS, as well as present beneficial changes in gene expression. Vitamin E appears to be the most powerful antioxidant for treating SLOS, and in mouse models has reduced the levels of [[oxysterol]]s in the brain. However, antioxidants have only been studied in animal models of SLOS or isolated SLOS cells. Thus, their clinical significance and negative side effects are still unknown, and their use has yet to be studied in humans.<ref name=antioxidant>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.06.013 |pmid=23896203 |title=Antioxidant Supplementation Ameliorates Molecular Deficits in Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome |year=2013 |last1=Korade |first1=Zeljka |last2=Xu |first2=Libin |last3=Harrison |first3=Fiona E. |last4=Ahsen |first4=Refayat |last5=Hart |first5=Sarah E. |last6=Folkes |first6=Oakleigh M. |last7=Mirnics |first7=K\u00e1roly |last8=Porter |first8=Ned A. |journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=215\u201322 |pmc=3874268 }}</ref>\n\n===Further considerations===\n\nWhen treating SLOS, a recurring issue is whether or not the intellectual and behavioural deficits are due to fixed developmental problems (i.e. fixed brain malformations), or due to ongoing abnormal sterol levels that interrupt the normal function of the brain and other tissues.<ref name=residual /> If the latter is true, then treatments which change the sterol levels and ratios, particularly in the brain, will likely improve the developmental outcome of the patient. However, if the former is true, then treatment is likely to help only with symptoms and not with specific developmental deficits.\n\n==Research==\nThe most common animal used to study SLOS is the [[mouse]]. According to [[BioCyc database collection|BioCyc]], cholesterol biosynthesis in mice is very similar to that of humans.

All teratogenic models can be effectively used to study SLOS; however, they present lower levels of 7-DHC and 8-DHC than are seen in humans. This can be explained by the fact that humans experience a permanent block in their DHCR7 activity, where mice and rats treated with inhibitors experience only transient blocks. Furthermore, different species of mice and rats are more [[drug resistance|resistant]] to teratogens, and may be less effective as models of SLOS.<ref name=ratinhibitor /> Teratogenic models are most commonly used to study more long-term effects of SLOS, because they survive longer than genetic models. For example, one study examined the retinal degeneration of SLOS, which in rats does not occur until at least one month after birth.<ref name=ratretinal />\n\n===Genetic models===\n[[Animal model|Genetic models]] of SLOS are created by [[gene knockout|knocking out]] the ''DHCR7'' gene. One study used [[homologous recombination]] to disrupt ''DCHR7'' in mouse [[embryonic stem cell]]s. Similar to what is found in humans, heterozygous mice (having only one mutated allele) were [[phenotype|phentoypically]] normal, and were crossed to produce pups (young mice) homozygous for the mutated allele. Although these pups died within the first day of life due to their inability to feed, they showed characteristics similar to humans with SLOS. They had decreased levels of cholesterol, increased levels of 7- and 8DHC, showed less growth and smaller birth weights, had [[craniofacial]] malformations, and less movement. Many also had a [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and decreased neuronal responses to [[glutamic acid|glutamate]]. Overall however, the pups had fewer dysmorphic features than human patients with SLOS; they did not present limb, renal, adrenal or [[central nervous system]] malformations. This is explained by the fact that in rodents, maternal cholesterol can cross the [[placenta]], and actually appears to be essential for the development of the fetus. In humans, very little maternal cholesterol is transferred to the fetus.

Originally, SLOS patients were classified into two categories (classic and severe) based on physical and mental characteristics, alongside other clinical features. Since the discovery of the specific biochemical defect responsible for SLOS, patients are given a severity score based on their levels of cerebral, ocular, oral, and genital defects. It is then used to classify patients as having mild, classical, or severe SLOS.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\n===Physical characteristics===\n\nThe most common facial features of SLOS include [[microcephaly]], bitemporal narrowing (reduced distance between temples), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], a short and upturned nose, [[micrognathism|micrognathia]], [[epicanthic fold|epicanthal folds]], and [[hemangioma|capillary hemangioma]] of the nose.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" /> Other physical characteristics include:\n\n[[File:Feets with partial simple syndactyly.jpg|350px|thumb|Syndactyly of the second and third toes]]\n\n*low-set and posteriorly rotated ears\n*high-arched, narrow, hard palate\n*[[Cleft lip and palate|cleft lip/palate]]\n*[[agenesis of the corpus callosum|agenesis]] or [[hypoplasia]] of the [[corpus callosum]]\n*cerebellar [[hypoplasia]]\n*increased [[ventricular system|ventricular]] size\n*decreased [[frontal lobe]] size\n*[[polydactyly]] of hands or feet\n*short, proximally placed thumb\n*other finger malformations\n*[[syndactyly]] of second and third toes\n*ambiguous or female-like male genitalia\n*congenital heart defects\n*renal, pulmonary, liver and eye abnormalities\n\n===Behavioural characteristics===\n\nCertain behaviours and attributes are commonly seen among patients suffering from SLOS. They may have low normal intelligence, and react negatively or with hypersensitivity to different sensory stimuli. This is particularly true for certain auditory and visual stimuli. Many patients show aggressiveness and [[self-harm|self-injurious]] behaviours, and sleep disturbances are common.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" /> Specific behaviours resembling those of people with [[autism]] are often present as well as [[hyperactivity]], which provides genetic and biological insights into autism spectrum disorders.

For example, infants often show feeding problems or feeding intolerance, and patients may require increased caloric intake due to accelerated metabolism. Recurrent infections, including ear infections and pneumonia, are also common.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\n===Biochemical phenotype===\n\nGiven that SLOS is caused by a mutation in an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, the resulting biochemical characteristics may be predictable. Most patients have lowered plasma cholesterol levels ([[hypocholesterolemia]]). However, approximately 10% may show normal cholesterol levels,<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />  and decreased concentrations of cholesterol are not solely indicative of SLOS. Increased levels of cholesterol precursors are also common in SLOS. In particular, elevated levels of [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] are fairly specific to SLOS.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />\n==Genetics==\n\n===DHCR7===\n\nThe gene encoding [[7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase|DHCR7]] (labeled as ''DHCR7'') was cloned in 1998, and has been mapped to [[chromosome 11|chromosome 11q12-13]].<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> It is 14100 [[base pair]]s of DNA in length, and contains nine [[exon]]s,<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> the corresponding [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] is 2786 base pairs in length (the remaining DNA sequence is intronic). The structure of the ''DHCR7'' rat gene is very similar to the structure of the human gene.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe highest levels of ''DHCR7'' [[gene expression|expression]] have been detected in the adrenal gland, the testis, the liver and in brain tissue.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Its expression is induced by decreased [[sterol]] concentrations via sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBP). There is also evidence that its activity may be regulated by tissue specific transcription, and [[alternative splicing]].\n\nAs outlined above, the enzyme DHCR7 catalyzes the reduction of 7DHC to cholesterol, as well as the reduction of 7-dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol. It requires NADPH as a cofactor for this reduction, and may involve the activity of [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase]]. It is also thought to contain iron.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> DHCR7 is an [[integral membrane protein]] of the endoplasmic reticulum, and computer models have predicted up to nine [[transmembrane domain]]s.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> DHCR7 is most efficient at reducing 7DHC, but it is known to reduce the carbon 7 double bond of other sterols, indicating a range of [[enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] [[specificity constant|specificity]]. The human version of this enzyme is predicted to have a [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 54,489 [[atomic mass unit|kDa]], and an [[isoelectric point]] of 9.05.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe [[amino acid]] sequence that encodes DHCR7 is predicted to contain 475 amino acids, as well as several [[sequence motif|protein motifs]]. It contains multiple sterol reductase motifs, as would be expected given its function. It contains a potential sterol-sensing domain (SSD), whose function is unknown but thought to be necessary for binding sterol substrates. It also includes multiple sites of phosphorylation, including potential [[protein kinase C]] and [[tyrosine kinase]] sites (regulatory enzymes responsible for phosphorylation). The exact function of phosphorylating DHCR7 is yet unknown, but it is thought to be involved in the regulation of its activity.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\n===Mutations and incidence===\n[[File:Missense Mutation Example.jpg|thumb|400px|Missense mutations account for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum]]\nSLOS is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive trait|recessive]] disorder.<ref name=insight>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00515.x |title=Recent insights into the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome |year=2005 |last1=Yu |first1=H |last2=Patel |first2=SB |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=383\u201391 |pmid=16207203 |pmc=1350989}}</ref> More than 130 different types of mutations have been identified.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />  [[Missense mutation]]s (single nucleotide change resulting in a code for a different amino acid) are the most common, accounting for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum. These typically reduce the function of the enzyme but may not inhibit it completely. Much depends on the nature of the mutation (i.e. which amino acid is replaced and where). [[Null allele|Null mutations]] are much less common, these mutations produce either a completely dysfunctional enzyme, or no enzyme at all.<ref name=insight /> Thus, missense mutations may be more common overall because they are less lethal than nonsense mutations; nonsense mutations may simply result in [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]].\n\nThe IVS8-1G>C is the most frequently reported mutation in ''DHCR7''. This disrupts the joining of exons eight and nine, and results in the insertion of 134 [[nucleotide]]s into the ''DHCR7'' transcript. This is a nonsense mutation, thus patients that are [[zygosity|homozygous]] for this allele are severely affected. It is thought that this mutation first occurred in the [[British Isles]], and it has a [[genetic carrier|carrier]] (those that are [[zygosity|heterozygous]] for the allele but not affected) frequency of 1.09% for Caucasians of European heritage. The frequency of mutations differs for various ethnicities, depending on the origin of the mutation. In all Caucasian populations, this particular mutation has an estimated carrier frequency of 3%.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe next most common mutation is 278C>T, and results in a [[threonine]] at the amino acid position 93. It is a missense mutation and tends to be associated with less severe symptoms. This mutation is the most common one seen in patients of Italian, Cuban, and Mediterranean descent.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nThe third most common mutation is  452G>A. This [[nonsense mutation]] causes protein termination, such that the enzyme DHCR7 would not be formed. It is thought to have arisen in Southern Poland and is most common in Northern Europe.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" />\n\nOther mutations are less common, although appear to target certain protein domains more so than others. For example, the sterol reductase motifs are common sites of mutation.<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Overall, there is an estimated carrier frequency (for any DHCR7 mutation causing SLOS) of 3-4% in Caucasian populations (it is less frequent among Asian and African populations<ref name=\"irons1998\">{{cite book |last=Nowaczyk |first=Malgorzata JM |chapter=Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1143/ |title=GeneReviews |publisher=National Library of Medicine |date=June 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |editor1-first=Roberta A |editor1-last=Pagon |editor2-first=Margaret P |editor2-last=Adam |editor3-first=Thomas D |editor3-last=Bird |editor4-first=Cynthia R |editor4-last=Dolan |editor5-first=Chin-To |editor5-last=Fong |editor6-first=Richard JH |editor6-last=Smith |editor7-first=Karen |editor7-last=Stephens}}</ref>).

However, the measured incidence is between 1/10,000 to 1/60,000 (it differs depending on heritage and descent).<ref name=insight /> This is much lower than expected. This indicates that many cases of SLOS are undetected, and is likely due to either spontaneous abortion caused by severe mutations (miscarriage), or mild cases that are undiagnosed. Females lack the characteristic genital malformations that affected males have, and thus are less likely to be correctly diagnosed.<ref name=\"irons1998\" />\n\n==Cholesterol metabolism and function==\n\n===Metabolism===\n\nCholesterol can be obtained through the diet, but it can also be formed by metabolism in the body.

In another pathway leading to cholesterol synthesis, DHCR7 is required for the reduction of [[7-Dehydrodesmosterol]] to [[desmosterol]].\n\n===Regulation===\n\nRegulation of cholesterol synthesis is complex and occurs primarily through the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (catalyst of the rate-limiting step). It involves a [[feedback]] loop that is sensitive to cellular levels of cholesterol. The four main steps of [[regulation of gene expression|regulation]] are:<ref name=biochembook />\n\n* The synthesis of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). This is a [[transcription factor]] that is inactive when cholesterol levels are high, and active when cholesterol levels are low. When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the [[nuclear membrane]] or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], it then migrates to the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and causes the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the HMG-CoA reductase [[gene]].\n* The [[translation (biology)|translation]] (creating the enzyme from the mRNA transcript) of HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by derivatives of mevalonate and by dietary cholesterol.\n* The degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is tightly controlled. The part of the enzyme that is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum senses signals, such as increased cholesterol levels, that lead to its degradation or [[proteolysis]].\n* When HMG-CoA reductase is [[phophorylation|phosphorylated]], its activity decreases. This means cholesterol synthesis is reduced when cell energy (ATP) levels are low.\n\n===Function===\n\nCholesterol is an important [[lipid]] involved in metabolism, cell function, and structure. It is a structural component of the [[cell membrane]],<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> such that it provides structure and regulates the [[membrane fluidity|fluidity]] of the [[lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]]. Furthermore, cholesterol is a constituent in [[lipid raft]]s. These are congregations of [[protein]]s and lipids (including [[sphingolipid]]s and cholesterol) that float within the cell membrane, and play a role in the regulation of membrane function. Lipid rafts are more ordered or rigid than the membrane bilayer surrounding them. Their involvement in regulation stems mostly from their association with proteins; upon binding substrates, some proteins have a higher affinity for attaching to lipid rafts. This brings them in close proximity with other proteins, allowing them to affect [[signal transduction|signaling pathways]]. Cholesterol specifically acts as a spacer and a glue for lipid rafts; absence of cholesterol leads to the dissociation of proteins.<ref name=Lipidraft>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI16390 |title=Cholesterol, lipid rafts, and disease |year=2002 |last1=Simons |first1=Kai |last2=Ehehalt |first2=Robert |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=597\u2013603 |pmid=12208858 |pmc=151114}}</ref>\n\nGiven its prevalence in cell membranes, cholesterol is highly involved in certain [[membrane transport|transport]] processes. It may influence the function of [[ion channel]]s and other membrane transporters. For example, cholesterol is necessary for the [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] binding activity of the [[serotonin]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].<ref name=serotonin>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.04.135 |title=Differential effects of cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol on the ligand binding activity of the hippocampal serotonin1A receptor: Implications in SLOS |year=2007 |last1=Singh |first1=Pushpendra |last2=Paila |first2=Yamuna Devi |last3=Chattopadhyay |first3=Amitabha |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=358 |issue=2 |pages=495\u20139 |pmid=17493586}}</ref> In addition, it appears to be very important in [[exocytosis]]. Cholesterol modulates the properties of the membrane (such as membrane curvature), and may regulate the fusion of [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] with the cell membrane. It may also facilitate the recruitment of complexes necessary for exocytosis. Given that [[neuron]]s rely heavily on exocytosis for the transmission of [[action potential|impulses]], cholesterol is a very important part of the [[nervous system]].<ref name=vesicle>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jcs.060681 |title=Cholesterol reduction impairs exocytosis of synaptic vesicles |year=2010 |last1=Linetti |first1=A. |last2=Fratangeli |first2=A. |last3=Taverna |first3=E. |last4=Valnegri |first4=P. |last5=Francolini |first5=M. |last6=Cappello |first6=V. |last7=Matteoli |first7=M. |last8=Passafaro |first8=M. |last9=Rosa |first9=P. |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=595\u2013605 |pmid=20103534 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cholesterolfunction.jpg|thumb|400px|Functions and derivatives of cholesterol.]]\nOne particularly relevant pathway in which cholesterol takes place is the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway]]. This pathway is very important during [[human embryogenesis|embryonic development]], and involved in deciding the fate of cells (i.e., which tissue they need to migrate to). Hedgehog proteins are also involved in the transcription of genes that regulate cell [[cell growth|proliferation]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Cholesterol is important to this pathway because it undergoes [[covalent bond]]ing to Hedgehog proteins, resulting in their activation. Without cholesterol, the signaling activity is disrupted and cell differentiation may be impaired.<ref name=Hedgehog>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.050 |title=Hedgehog signalling |year=2008 |last1=Ingham |first1=Philip W. |journal=Current Biology |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=R238\u201341 |pmid=18364223}}</ref>\n\nCholesterol is a precursor for many important molecules. These include [[bile acid]]s (important in processing dietary fats), [[oxysterols]], [[neuroactive steroid|neurosteroids]] (involved in neurotransmission and excitation), [[glucocorticoid]]s (involved in immune and inflammatory processes), [[mineralocorticoid]]s (osmotic balance), and [[sex steroid]]s (i.e. [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone]]; wide range of function but involved in genital development prenatally).<ref name=\"DHCR7 and SLOS\" /> Finally, cholesterol is a major component of [[myelin]], a protective layer around neurons. Myelination occurs most rapidly during prenatal development, meaning that the demand for cholesterol biosynthesis is very high.<ref name=\"Imaging\" />\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n\nGiven that the function of [[cholesterol]] encompasses a very wide range, it is unlikely that the symptoms of SLOS are due to a single molecular mechanism. Some of the molecular effects are yet unknown, but could be extrapolated based on the role of cholesterol. In general, the negative effects are due to decreased levels of cholesterol and increased levels of cholesterol precursors-most notably, [[7-Dehydrocholesterol|7DHC]]. Although 7DHC is structurally similar to cholesterol, and could potentially act as a substitute, the effects of this are still being studied.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" />\n\nMost patients with SLOS present decreased cholesterol levels, particularly in the brain (where cholesterol levels rely primarily on new synthesis). This also means that any sterol derivatives of cholesterol would also have reduced concentrations. For example, reduced levels of [[neuractive steroid|neurosteroids]] may be seen in SLOS. These are lipids which take part in signaling within the brain, and must be produced within the brain itself. They are responsible for interacting with [[nuclear receptor|nuclear steroid receptors]], and bind to [[neurotransmitter]]-gated ion channels. Specifically, they modulate the effects of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptors, resulting in calming effects, improved memory, and more. Thus, given that some characteristics of SLOS are the opposite of these effects (hyperactivity, anxiety), a reduction in neurosteroids could influence both neurological development and behaviour.<ref name=neurosteroid>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.steroids.2003.09.013 |title=The implications of 7-dehydrosterol-7-reductase deficiency (Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome) to neurosteroid production |year=2004 |last1=Marcos |first1=Josep |last2=Guo |first2=Li-Wei |last3=Wilson |first3=William K |last4=Porter |first4=Forbes D |last5=Shackleton |first5=Cedric |journal=Steroids |volume=69 |pages=51\u201360 |pmid=14715377 |issue=1}}</ref>\n[[File:PathogenesisSLOS.png|thumb|right|500px|Pathogenesis of Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome.]]\nFurthermore, as outlined above, cholesterol is an important aspect in Hedgehog signaling. With lower levels of cholesterol, hedgehog proteins would not undergo the necessary covalent modification and subsequent activation. This would result in impaired embryonic development, and may contribute to the observed physical [[congenital disorder|birth defects]] in SLOS. One particular hedgehog signaling protein, [[sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), is important in the pattern of the central nervous system, facial features, and limbs.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> Other hedghehog proteins may be involved in the development of the genital tract and the skeleon.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n\nThe altered sterol levels in SLOS are particularly relevant to cell membranes, which are made primarily of lipids.

It also increases the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis). 7DHC leads to novel [[oxysterol]] and [[steroid]] derivatives, and many of their functions or effects are yet unknown.<ref name=\"SLOS review\" /> A very important finding with respect to 7DHC is that it is the most reactive lipid for [[lipid peroxidation]], and results in systemic [[oxidative stress]]. Lipid peroxidation is known to destroy membranes of both cells and membrane-bound [[organelle]]s. The derivative of 7DHC that is used to indicate oxidative stress is 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-dihydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO); it is formed from a primary product of 7DHC peroxidation, 7-DHC-5\u03b1,6\u03b1-epoxide.

Given that 7DHC is more readily oxidized, it enhances the effects of UVA, leading to increased membrane lipid oxidation and increased production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).<ref name=UVA />\n\nTypically, more altered the levels of 7DHC and cholesterol lead to more severe symptoms of SLOS. The levels of these metabolites also correspond to the severity of the mutation (nonsense versus missense); some mutations of DHCR7 may still show residual cholesterol synthesis, and others may not. However, even individuals with the same mutations or genotype may still show variability in their symptoms. This may be due to maternal factors, such as the transfer of cholesterol to the fetus during pregnancy, as well as the amount of cholesterol present in the brain before the blood\u2013brain barrier forms prenatally. The rate of accumulation and [[excretion]] of toxic metabolites may vary from person to person. Maternal [[apolipoprotein E]] has also been implicated in individual variability in SLOS, although the exact nature of this relationship is unknown.<ref name=insight /> There are likely more factors contributing to the wide spectrum of effects in SLOS which have not yet been discovered.\n\n==Screening and diagnosis==\n\n===Prenatally===\n\nThe most characteristic biochemical indicator of SLOS is an increased concentration of [[7-dehydrocholesterol|7DHC]] (reduced [[cholesterol]] levels are also typical, but appear in other disorders as well). Thus, [[prenatal diagnosis|prenatally]], SLOS is diagnosed upon finding an elevated 7DHC:total sterol ratio in fetal tissues, or increased levels of 7DHC in [[amniotic fluid]]. The 7DHC:total sterol ratio can be measured at 11\u201312 weeks of [[gestation]] by [[chorionic villus sampling]], and elevated 7DHC in amniotic fluid can be measured by 13 weeks. Furthermore, if parental mutations are known, DNA testing of amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples may be performed.<ref name=\"SLOS novel met\" />\n[[File:Chorionic villi - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Micrograph showing chorionic vili, the tissue that is collected with chorionic villus sampling and used to test for SLOS.]]\n[[Amniocentesis]] (process of sampling amniotic fluid) and chorionic villus sampling cannot be performed until approximately 3 months into the pregnancy. Given that SLOS is a very severe syndrome, parents may want to choose to terminate their pregnancy if their fetus is affected. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling leave very little time to make this decision (abortions become more difficult as the pregnancy advances), and can also pose severe risks to the mother and baby. Thus, there is a very large desire for noninvasive midgestation diagnostic tests.<ref name=midgestation>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0039-128X(99)00026-4 |title=Midgestational maternal urine steroid markers of fetal Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz (SLO) syndrome (7-dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase deficiency) |year=1999 |last1=Shackleton |first1=C |journal=Steroids |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=446\u201352 |pmid=10443900 |last2=Roitman |first2=E |last3=Kratz |first3=LE |last4=Kelley |first4=RI}}</ref> Examining the concentrations of [[sterol]]s in maternal urine is one potential way to identify SLOS prenatally. During pregnancy, the fetus is solely responsible for synthesizing the cholesterol needed to produce [[estriol]]. A fetus with SLOS cannot produce cholesterol, and may use 7DHC or 8DHC as precursors for estriol instead. This creates 7- or 8-dehydrosteroids (such as 7-dehydroestriol), which may show up in the maternal urine. These are novel metabolites due to the presence of a normally reduced [[double bond]] at carbon 7 (caused by the inactivity of DHCR7), and may be used as indicators of SLOS.<ref name=pregmouse>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.04.011 |title=Steroid production and excretion by the pregnant mouse, particularly in relation to pregnancies with fetuses deficient in \u03947-sterol reductase (Dhcr7), the enzyme associated with Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome |year=2009 |last1=Matabosch |first1=Xavier |last2=Rahman |first2=Mahbuba |last3=Hughes |first3=Beverly |last4=Patel |first4=Shailendra B. |last5=Watson |first5=Gordon |last6=Shackleton |first6=Cedric |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=116 |pages=61\u201370 |pmid=19406241 |issue=1\u20132 |pmc=2929956}}</ref> Other cholesterol derivatives which possess a double bond at the 7th or 8th position and are present in maternal urine may also be indicators of SLOS. 7- and 8-dehydropregnanetriols have been shown to be present in the urine of mothers with an affected fetus but not with an unaffected fetus, and thus are used in diagnosis.

This is a simple [[colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetric]] assay developed with the intention of use for large scale screening. When treated with the LB reagent, SLOS samples turn pink immediately and gradually become blue; normal blood samples are initially colorless and develop a faint blue color. Although this method has limitations and is not used to give a definitive diagnosis, it has appeal in that it is a much faster method than using cell cultures.<ref name=LB>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0009-3084(01)00205-5 |title=A colorimetric assay for 7-dehydrocholesterol with potential application to screening for Smith\u2013Lemli\u2013Opitz syndrome |year=2002 |last1=Xiong |first1=Quanbo |last2=Ruan |first2=Benfang |last3=Whitby |first3=Frank G. |last4=Tuohy |first4=Richard P. |last5=Belanger |first5=Thomas L. |last6=Kelley |first6=Richard I. |last7=Wilson |first7=William K. |last8=Schroepfer |first8=George J. |journal=Chemistry and Physics of Lipids |volume=115 |pages=1\u201315 |pmid=12047895 |issue=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of detecting 7DHC is through [[gas chromatography]], a technique used to separate and analyze compounds.

Simvastatin increases the [[gene expression|expression]] of ''DHCR7'', likely leading to increased activity of DHCR7. It has also been shown to increase the expression of other genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. However, these benefits are dependent on the amount of residual cholesterol synthesis. Because some individuals possess less severe mutations and demonstrate some amount of DCHR7 activity, these people benefit the most from simvastatin therapy as they still have a partially functioning enzyme. For individuals that show no residual DCHR7 activity, such as those [[zygosity|homozygous]] for null alleles or mutations, simvastatin therapy may actually be toxic.<ref name=residual /> This highlights the importance of identifying the specific [[genotype]] of the SLOS patient before administering treatment. It is still unknown if simvastatin will improve the behavioural or learning deficits in SLOS.<ref name=mousesimvastatin />\n\n===Antioxidant supplementation===\n\n[[Antioxidant]]s are those which inhibit the oxidation of molecules or reduce metabolites that were previously oxidized. Given that some symptoms of SLOS are thought to result from the [[lipid peroxidation|peroxidation]] of 7DHC and its derivatives, inhibiting this peroxidation would likely have beneficial effects. Antioxidants have been shown to increase the level of lipid transcripts in SLOS cells, these transcripts play a role in lipid (cholesterol) biosynthesis and are known to be down-regulated in SLOS. Furthermore, [[vitamin E]] specifically is known to decrease DHCEO levels, which is an indicator of [[oxidative stress]] in SLOS, as well as present beneficial changes in gene expression. Vitamin E appears to be the most powerful antioxidant for treating SLOS, and in mouse models has reduced the levels of [[oxysterol]]s in the brain. However, antioxidants have only been studied in animal models of SLOS or isolated SLOS cells.

All teratogenic models can be effectively used to study SLOS; however, they present lower levels of 7-DHC and 8-DHC than are seen in humans. This can be explained by the fact that humans experience a permanent block in their DHCR7 activity, where mice and rats treated with inhibitors experience only transient blocks. Furthermore, different species of mice and rats are more [[drug resistance|resistant]] to teratogens, and may be less effective as models of SLOS.<ref name=ratinhibitor /> Teratogenic models are most commonly used to study more long-term effects of SLOS, because they survive longer than genetic models. For example, one study examined the retinal degeneration of SLOS, which in rats does not occur until at least one month after birth.<ref name=ratretinal />\n\n===Genetic models===\n[[Animal model|Genetic models]] of SLOS are created by [[gene knockout|knocking out]] the ''DHCR7'' gene. One study used [[homologous recombination]] to disrupt ''DCHR7'' in mouse [[embryonic stem cell]]s. Similar to what is found in humans, heterozygous mice (having only one mutated allele) were [[phenotype|phentoypically]] normal, and were crossed to produce pups (young mice) homozygous for the mutated allele. Although these pups died within the first day of life due to their inability to feed, they showed characteristics similar to humans with SLOS. They had decreased levels of cholesterol, increased levels of 7- and 8DHC, showed less growth and smaller birth weights, had [[craniofacial]] malformations, and less movement. Many also had a [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and decreased neuronal responses to [[glutamic acid|glutamate]]. Overall however, the pups had fewer dysmorphic features than human patients with SLOS; they did not present limb, renal, adrenal or [[central nervous system]] malformations. This is explained by the fact that in rodents, maternal cholesterol can cross the [[placenta]], and actually appears to be essential for the development of the fetus. In humans, very little maternal cholesterol is transferred to the fetus.

From 1657 the village owned by a boyar [[Bogdan Khitrovo]], who built there stone church of Intercession of the Virgin, preserved to our time. At that time (1680), in Brattsevo was 24 peasant yards and 49 residents. After the death of Khitrovo and his widow Maria Ivanovna, the village has been received by Cyril Naryshkin, relative of [[Peter the Great]] on his mother (1695).\n\nNaryshkins owned of Brattsevo nearly a century. In 1780 the village was bought from the daughters of Cyril Naryshkin be Count Alexander Stroganoff, who immediately conveyed Brattsevo to his wife Catherine Petrovna. Soon after Count Stroganoff divorced the Countess because of her romance with Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov (former favorite of [[Catherine the Great]]), leaving Brattsevo to Catherine Petrovna. Countess Catherine P. Stroganoff lived in Brattsevo with Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov until her death (1815). After her death, Brattsevo was owned by Rimsky-Korsakov. Apparently, c. 1813 upon a picturesque hill near the village was created a complex estates and parks, existing to our time. The architect is expected to be [[Andrey Voronikhin]], a former serf of Counts Stroganoff. Palace was built as an imitation of [[Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\"|Villa Rotonda]] by [[Andrea Palladio]].  After the death of Rimsky-Korsakov  (1831), Brattsevo was owned by his illegitimate son from Catherine Stroganoff, Colonel Vassily Ladomirsky. In summer 1866 in Brattsevo lived the artist [[Ivan Shishkin]]. His picture \"Noon. Neighborhoods of Moscow\" is based on his etudes of Brattsevo. In 1852 there were 25 peasant yards and 168 residents in Brattsevo, in 1898 - 49 yards and 209 residents. In 1888 was opened the parish school. In 1879, on the banks of Skhodnya on the site of mill, first referred to in the will in 1565, was constructed a cloth factory of Ivan Suvirov. The local farmers were not employed at this factory, as the manufacturer has wished the workers to be absolutely dependent.

After the February Revolution of 1917 a conflict happened between Hutarev and its workers. Hutarev tried to declare a lockout, but the factory committee had a factory management in their own hands. Hutarev refused to pay, while workers locked him in a shed and released him only after his wife brought the money from Moscow. In November 1917 the new conflict occurred, when in October some of the factory workers, being members of the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], took part in the passages of arms in Moscow and Hutarev refused to admit them to work after their return. As a result, he was arrested again by workers, but successfully escaped never to return again, leaving the factory under the rule of workers.\n\nThe last owner of estate was an archaeologist, director of the [[State Historical Museum|Imperial Historical Museum]], Prince Nikolai Shcherbatov. After the revolution of 1917, he willingly transferred Brattsevo to the State, insisting, however, that it must be taken under state protection as a monument of architecture.  For some time there was a museum in the palace, but soon (1922) it was closed. After that, the estate was turned into a relaxation house for [[Revolutionary Military Council]] ''(Revvoensoviet)'' and was reorganized as a [[sovkhoz]] by ''Revvoensoviet'', by  based on landowner's economy.
