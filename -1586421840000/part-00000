As owner of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', he was an early developer of popular journalism, and he exercised vast influence over British popular opinion during the [[Edwardian era]]. [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] said he was \"the greatest figure who ever strode down [[Fleet Street]].\"<ref>Lord Beaverbrook, ''Politicians and the War, 1914\u20131916'' (1928) 1:93.</ref> About the beginning of the 20th century there were increasing attempts to develop popular journalism intended for the working class and tending to emphasize sensational topics. Harmsworth was the main innovator. \n\nNorthcliffe had a powerful role during the First World War, especially by criticizing the government regarding the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]]. He directed a mission to the new ally, the United States, during 1917, and was director of enemy propaganda during 1918.\n\nHis [[Amalgamated Press]] employed writers such as [[Arthur Mee]] and [[John Alexander Hammerton|John Hammerton]], and its subsidiary, the Educational Book Company, published ''[[The Harmsworth Self-Educator]]'', ''[[The Children's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]'', and ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and success===\n\nBorn in [[Chapelizod]], [[County Dublin]], the son of [[Alfred Harmsworth (barrister)|Alfred]] and Geraldine Harmsworth, he was educated at [[Stamford School]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England, from 1876 and at Henley House School in [[Kilburn, London]] from 1878.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33717|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> A master at Henley House who was to prove important to his future was J.

Wells]], ''An Experiment in Autobiography'', Chapter 6</ref> In 1880 he first visited the [[Sylvan Debating Club]], founded by his father, and of which he later served as Treasurer.\n\nBeginning as a freelance journalist, he initiated his first newspaper, ''Answers'' (original title: ''Answers to Correspondents''), and was later assisted by his brother [[Harold Harmsworth|Harold]], who was adept in business matters. Harmsworth had an intuitive sense for what the reading public wanted to buy, and began a series of cheap but successful periodicals, such as ''[[Comic Cuts]]'' (tagline: \"Amusing without being Vulgar\") and the journal ''Forget-Me-Not'' for women. From these periodicals, he developed the largest periodical publishing company in the world, [[Amalgamated Press]].<ref> Boyce (2004).</ref> His half-penny periodicals published in the 1890s played a role in the decline of the Victorian [[penny dreadful]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Springhall |first=John |title=Youth, Popular Culture and Moral Panics |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/youthpopularcult00john/page/75 75] |isbn=978-0-312-21394-7 |oclc=38206817 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/youthpopularcult00john/page/75 }}</ref>\n\nHarmsworth was an early developer of popular journalism. He bought several failing newspapers and made them into an enormously profitable news group, primarily by appealing to the general public. He began with [[Evening News (London)|''The Evening News'']] during 1894, and then merged two Edinburgh papers to form the ''Edinburgh Daily Record''. That same year he funded an [[Jackson\u2013Harmsworth expedition|expedition]] to [[Franz Joseph Land]] in the Arctic with the intention of making attempts to travel to the North Pole.<ref> Brice, Arthur Montefiore, and H.

Boyish the limited range of his intellect, which seldom concerns itself with anything but the immediate, the obvious, the popular.

Lord Northcliffe's newspapers propagandized for creating a [[Minister of Munitions]] (a job first held by [[David Lloyd George]]) and helped to bring about Lloyd George's appointment as prime minister during 1916.

He was monolingual and not well-educated; he knew little history or science. He had a lust for power and for money, while leaving the accounting paperwork to his brother Harold.  He imagined himself Napoleon reborn, and did resemble the emperor physically and in terms of enormous energy and ambition. Above all, he had a boyish enthusiasm for everything. Norman Fyfe, an intimate friend, states he was:\n<blockquote>Boyish in his power of concentration upon the matter of the moment, boyish in his readiness to turn swiftly to a different matter and concentrate on that. . . . Boyish the limited range of his intellect, which seldom concerns itself with anything but the immediate, the obvious, the popular. Boyish his irresponsibility, his disinclination to take himself or his publications seriously; his conviction that whatever benefits them is justifiable, and that it is not his business to consider the effect of their contents on the public mind.<ref>Hamilton Fyfe, ''Northcliffe an Intimate Biography'' (1930) p. 106. </ref></blockquote>\n\n==Sport==\n\nIn 1903 Harmsworth initiated the [[Harmsworth Cup]], the first international award for [[motorboat]] racing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Harmsworth-Cup|title=Harmsworth Cup {{!}} motorboat racing award|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Motoring===\n\nHarmsworth was a friend of [[Claude Johnson]], chief executive of [[Rolls-Royce Limited]], and during the years preceding the First World war became an enthusiast of the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] car.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Peter|title=The Magic of a Name The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years|publisher=Icon Books|year=2001|isbn=978-1-84046-151-0}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Lord Northcliffe circa 1921 driving Fordson at Dearborn.png|thumb|Lord Northcliffe circa 1921 driving a [[Fordson]] tractor at [[Henry Ford]]'s farm near [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

The scheme promised land in [[Western Australia]] to British settlers prepared to emigrate and develop the land. A town founded specifically to assist the new settlements was named [[Northcliffe, Western Australia|Northcliffe]], in recognition of Lord Northcliffe's promotion of the scheme.\n\nNorthcliffe lived for a time at 31 Pandora Road, West Hampstead \u2013 this site is now marked with an English Heritage blue plaque.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|''Daily Mail'' aviation prizes]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Boyce, D.

His contribution to Allied victory lay chiefly in logistics. He was particularly adept at converting data into clear charts to promote a strategy. But despite his credentials, his judgment about technology was often flawed. He tried to block the development of radar in favour of infra-red beams. He discounted the first reports of the enemy's \"V\" weapons programme. He pressed the case for the strategic area bombing of cities on a false premise about the impact of such bombing on civilian morale.\n\nHis abiding influence on Churchill stemmed from close personal friendship, as a member of the latter's country-house set, including [[Evelyn Waugh]], the [[Mitford family|Mitfords]] and the [[The Sitwells|Sitwells]].

Instead of subscribing to what he called 'the fetish of equality', Lindemann recommended that human differences should be accepted and indeed enhanced by means of science.

He appointed to the Clarendon one of Churchill's social set that included the [[Mitford family|Mitfords]] and the Cavendish family, the young Welshman [[Derek Jackson]]. This brilliant young physicist, the son of [[Charles James Jackson|Sir Charles Jackson]], transferred from the Nobel prize-winning labs at Cambridge and worked on Lindemann's top-secret nuclear energy projects.{{efn| Proceedings of the Royal Society, 'hyperfine structure in the arc spectrum of caesium and nuclear rotation'.}}\n\nLindemann moved in rich circles at [[Biddesden House|Biddesden]], the [[Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh|Earl of Iveagh]]'s home, hosted with literary luminaries [[Augustus John]], [[Lytton Strachey]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], the Carringtons and the Mitfords, the Sitwells and the Huxley families.  One frequently intoxicated visitor was a wayward [[Randolph Churchill]].\n\nIn 1932, Lindemann joined Winston to complete a road trip throughout Europe and were dismayed at what they saw. Churchill later said, \"A terrible process is astir. Germany is arming.\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mukerjee|2010|p=45}}</ref> Lindemann was prevailed upon to release Jackson in 1940 to join the RAF at Loughbourgh; he flew in the Battle of Britain and won a DFC. Lindemann also assisted the new Prime Minister in the rescue of a number of German Jewish physicists, primarily at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], to emigrate to Britain supplementing the vital war work developing at the Clarendon Laboratory, including the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nChurchill got Lindemann onto the \"Committee for the Study of Aerial Defence\" which under [[Henry Tizard|Sir Henry Tizard]] was putting its resources behind the development of [[radar]].  Lindemann's presence was disruptive, insisting instead that his own ideas of aerial mines and [[infra-red]] beams be given priority over radar.

This branch scrutinised the performance of the regular ministries and prioritised the logistical machinery of warfare. S-Branch distilled thousands of sources of data into succinct charts and figures, so that the status of the nation's food supplies (for example) could be instantly evaluated. The bar charts now on display in the [[Cabinet War Rooms]] which compare allied shipping tonnage lost to new ships delivered each month and those comparing bomb tonnage dropped by Germany on Britain with that dropped by the allies on Germany each month are mute testaments to both the intellectual and the psychological power of his statistical presentations. Lindemann's statistical branch often caused tensions between government departments, but because it allowed Churchill to make quick decisions based on accurate data which directly affected the war effort, its importance should not be underestimated.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1940, Lindemann supported the experimental department [[MD1]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref>{{cite book\n | first = Stuart\n | last = Macrae\n | authorlink=<!--Stuart Macrae (inventor)-->\n | title = Winston Churchill's Toyshop\n | publisher = Roundwood Press\n | year = 1971\n | id= SBN 900093-22-6\n}}</ref> He worked on [[hollow charge]] weapons, the [[sticky bomb]] and other new weapons.

In his appointment as Personal Assistant to the Prime Minister no field of activity was closed to him.

Instead of subscribing to what he called 'the fetish of equality', Lindemann recommended that human differences should be accepted and indeed enhanced by means of science.

In 1915, he joined the staff of the [[Royal Aircraft Factory]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]]. He developed a mathematical theory of [[Spin (flight)|aircraft spin]] recovery, and later learned to fly so that he could test his ideas himself.<ref name=\"frs\"/> Prior to Lindemann's work, a spinning aircraft was almost invariably unrecoverable and the result to the pilot fatal.\n\nIn 1919 Lindemann was appointed professor of experimental philosophy (physics) at the [[University of Oxford]] and director of the [[Clarendon Laboratory]], largely on the recommendation of [[Henry Tizard]] who had been a colleague in Berlin.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Also in 1919, he was one of the first people to suggest that an electrically neutral [[solar wind|wind]] of positively charged [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s is emitted from the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lindemann, F.|date=December 1919|title=Note on the theory of magnetic storms|url=|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|series=Series 6|volume=38|issue=228|pages=669\u2013684|doi=10.1080/14786441208636000}}</ref> He might have been unaware that [[Kristian Birkeland]] had speculated three years earlier that the solar wind might be a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYM_AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|title=Kristian Birkeland: The First Space Scientist|last1=Egeland|first1=Alv|last2=Burke|first2=William J.|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-3294-3|page=80}}</ref> At the same time he worked on the theory of [[specific heat]]s and on [[temperature inversion]] in the [[stratosphere]], and began to bring the two scientific disciplines together.<ref name=Laidler>[[Keith J.

Although the two men had very different lifestyles, they both excelled at a sport: Churchill's was [[polo]]. Lindemann's ability to explain scientific issues concisely, and his excellent flying skills, probably impressed Churchill, who had given up trying to earn a pilot's licence because of Clementine's grave concerns.

He appointed to the Clarendon one of Churchill's social set that included the [[Mitford family|Mitfords]] and the Cavendish family, the young Welshman [[Derek Jackson]]. This brilliant young physicist, the son of [[Charles James Jackson|Sir Charles Jackson]], transferred from the Nobel prize-winning labs at Cambridge and worked on Lindemann's top-secret nuclear energy projects.{{efn| Proceedings of the Royal Society, 'hyperfine structure in the arc spectrum of caesium and nuclear rotation'.}}\n\nLindemann moved in rich circles at [[Biddesden House|Biddesden]], the [[Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh|Earl of Iveagh]]'s home, hosted with literary luminaries [[Augustus John]], [[Lytton Strachey]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], the Carringtons and the Mitfords, the Sitwells and the Huxley families.  One frequently intoxicated visitor was a wayward [[Randolph Churchill]].\n\nIn 1932, Lindemann joined Winston to complete a road trip throughout Europe and were dismayed at what they saw. Churchill later said, \"A terrible process is astir. Germany is arming.\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mukerjee|2010|p=45}}</ref> Lindemann was prevailed upon to release Jackson in 1940 to join the RAF at Loughbourgh; he flew in the Battle of Britain and won a DFC.

This branch scrutinised the performance of the regular ministries and prioritised the logistical machinery of warfare. S-Branch distilled thousands of sources of data into succinct charts and figures, so that the status of the nation's food supplies (for example) could be instantly evaluated. The bar charts now on display in the [[Cabinet War Rooms]] which compare allied shipping tonnage lost to new ships delivered each month and those comparing bomb tonnage dropped by Germany on Britain with that dropped by the allies on Germany each month are mute testaments to both the intellectual and the psychological power of his statistical presentations. Lindemann's statistical branch often caused tensions between government departments, but because it allowed Churchill to make quick decisions based on accurate data which directly affected the war effort, its importance should not be underestimated.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1940, Lindemann supported the experimental department [[MD1]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref>{{cite book\n | first = Stuart\n | last = Macrae\n | authorlink=<!--Stuart Macrae (inventor)-->\n | title = Winston Churchill's Toyshop\n | publisher = Roundwood Press\n | year = 1971\n | id= SBN 900093-22-6\n}}</ref> He worked on [[hollow charge]] weapons, the [[sticky bomb]] and other new weapons.

This sequence can be used to approximate the distribution (e.g. to generate a [[histogram]]) or to [[Monte Carlo integration|compute an integral]] (e.g. an [[expected value]]).  Metropolis\u2013Hastings and other MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high.  For single-dimensional distributions, there are usually other methods (e.g. [[adaptive rejection sampling]]) that can directly return independent samples from the distribution, and these are free from the problem of [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] samples that is inherent in MCMC methods.\n\n==History==\nThe algorithm was named after [[Nicholas Metropolis]], who authored the 1953 article ''[[Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines]]'' together with [[Arianna W. Rosenbluth]], [[Marshall Rosenbluth]], [[Augusta H. Teller]] and [[Edward Teller]].  This article proposed the algorithm for the case of symmetrical proposal distributions, and [[W. K. Hastings]] extended it to the more general case in 1970.<ref name=Hastings/>\n\nSome controversy exists with regard to credit for development of the algorithm.  Metropolis had coined the term \"Monte Carlo\" in an earlier article with [[Stanislav Ulam]], was familiar with the computational aspects of the method, and led the group in the Theoretical Division that designed and built the [[MANIAC I]] computer used in the experiments in 1952.  However, prior to 2003, there was no detailed account of the algorithm's development.  Then, shortly before his death, [[Marshall Rosenbluth]] attended a 2003 conference at LANL marking the 50th anniversary of the 1953 publication.  At this conference, Rosenbluth described the algorithm and its development in a presentation titled \"Genesis of the Monte Carlo Algorithm for Statistical Mechanics\".<ref name=Rosenbluth/>  Further historical clarification is made by Gubernatis in a 2005 journal article<ref name=Gubernatis/> recounting the 50th anniversary conference. Rosenbluth makes it clear that he and his wife Arianna did the work, and that Metropolis played no role in the development other than providing computer time.\n\nThis contradicts an account by Edward Teller, who states in his memoirs that the five authors of the 1953 article worked together for \"days (and nights)\".<ref name=Teller/> In contrast, the detailed account by Rosenbluth credits Teller with a crucial but early suggestion to \"take advantage of statistical mechanics and take ensemble averages instead of following detailed kinematics\".  This, says Rosenbluth, started him thinking about the generalized Monte Carlo approach \u2013 a topic which he says he had discussed often with [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]].  Arianna recounted (to Gubernatis in 2003) that Augusta Teller started the computer work, but that Arianna herself took it over and wrote the code from scratch.  In an oral history recorded shortly before his death,<ref name=Barth/> Rosenbluth again credits Teller with posing the original problem, himself with solving it, and Arianna with programming the computer.  In terms of reputation, there is little reason to question Rosenbluth's account.  In a biographical memoir of Rosenbluth, [[Freeman Dyson]] writes:<ref name=Dyson/>\n{{Quote\n|text=Many times I came to Rosenbluth, asking him a question [...] and receiving an answer in two minutes.  Then it would usually take me a week of hard work to understand in detail why Rosenbluth's answer was right.  He had an amazing ability to see through a complicated physical situation and reach the right answer by physical arguments.  Enrico Fermi was the only other physicist I have known who was equal to Rosenbluth in his intuitive grasp of physics.\n}}\n\n==Intuition==\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm can draw samples from any [[probability distribution]] <math>P(x)</math>, provided that we know a function <math>f(x)</math> proportional to the [[Probability density function|density]] of <math>P</math> and the values of <math>f(x)</math> can be calculated. The requirement that <math>f(x)</math> must only be proportional to the density, rather than exactly equal to it, makes the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm particularly useful, because calculating the necessary normalization factor is often extremely difficult in practice.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm works by generating a sequence of sample values in such a way that, as more and more sample values are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>. These sample values are produced iteratively, with the distribution of the next sample being dependent only on the current sample value (thus making the sequence of samples into a [[Markov chain]]). Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next sample value based on the current sample value. Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)\u2014the probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function <math>f(x)</math> of the current and candidate sample values with respect to the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nFor the purpose of illustration, the Metropolis algorithm, a special case of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm where the proposal function is symmetric, is described below.\n<!---The sample values are linked in a [[Markov chain]], which means that the probability of each sample is conditionally independent of any earlier sample, given the sample immediately before it. In other words, \ngeneral idea is to generate a sequence of samples which are linked in a [[Markov chain]]; in other words, where each sample in the sequence is conditionally independent of any earlier sample, given the sample immediately before it. The procedure for choosing successive samples guarantees that the distribution of sample values will match the desired distribution ''P''(''x'') after a long time.!-->\n\n'''Metropolis algorithm (symmetric proposal distribution)'''\n\nLet <math>f(x)</math> be a function that is proportional to the desired probability distribution <math>P(x)</math> (a.k.a. a target distribution).\n\n# Initialization: Choose an arbitrary point <math>x_t</math> to be the first sample and choose an arbitrary probability density <math>g(x\\mid y)</math> (sometimes written <math>Q(x\\mid y)</math>) that suggests a candidate for the next sample value <math>x</math>, given the previous sample value <math>y</math>. In this section, <math>g</math> is assumed to be symmetric; in other words, it must satisfy <math>g(x\\mid y) = g(y\\mid x)</math>. A usual choice is to let <math>g(x\\mid y)</math> be a [[Gaussian distribution]] centered at <math>y</math>, so that points closer to <math>y</math> are more likely to be visited next, making the sequence of samples into a [[random walk]].  The function <math>g</math> is referred to as the ''proposal density'' or ''jumping distribution''.\n# For each iteration ''t'':\n#* ''Generate'' a candidate <math>x'</math> for the next sample by picking from the distribution <math>g(x'\\mid x_t)</math>.\n#* ''Calculate'' the ''acceptance ratio'' <math>\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t)</math>, which will be used to decide whether to accept or reject the candidate. Because ''f'' is proportional to the density of ''P'', we have that <math>\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t) = P(x')/P(x_t)</math>.\n#* ''Accept or reject'': \n#** Generate a uniform random number <math>u \\in [0, 1]</math>.\n#** If <math>u \\le \\alpha</math>, then ''accept'' the candidate by setting <math>x_{t+1} = x'</math>,\n#** If <math>u > \\alpha</math>, then ''reject'' the candidate and set <math>x_{t+1} = x_t</math> instead.\n\nThis algorithm proceeds by randomly attempting to move about the sample space, sometimes accepting the moves and sometimes remaining in place.  Note that the acceptance ratio <math>\\alpha</math> indicates how probable the new proposed sample is with respect to the current sample, according to the distribution <math>P(x)</math>.  If we attempt to move to a point that is more probable than the existing point (i.e. a point in a higher-density region of <math>P(x)</math>), we will always accept the move.  However, if we attempt to move to a less probable point, we will sometimes reject the move, and the more the relative drop in probability, the more likely we are to reject the new point.  Thus, we will tend to stay in (and return large numbers of samples from) high-density regions of <math>P(x)</math>, while only occasionally visiting low-density regions.  Intuitively, this is why this algorithm works and returns samples that follow the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nCompared with an algorithm like [[adaptive rejection sampling]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title = Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Gibbs Sampling |jstor = 2347565 |journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Even though over the long term they do correctly follow <math>P(x)</math>, a set of nearby samples will be correlated with each other and not correctly reflect the distribution.  This means that if we want a set of independent samples, we have to throw away the majority of samples and only take every ''n''th sample, for some value of ''n'' (typically determined by examining the [[autocorrelation]] between adjacent samples).  Autocorrelation can be reduced by increasing the ''jumping width'' (the average size of a jump, which is related to the variance of the jumping distribution), but this will also increase the likelihood of rejection of the proposed jump.  Too large or too small a jumping size will lead to a ''slow-mixing'' Markov chain, i.e. a highly correlated set of samples, so that a very large number of samples will be needed to get a reasonable estimate of any desired property of the distribution.\n* Although the Markov chain eventually converges to the desired distribution, the initial samples may follow a very different distribution, especially if the starting point is in a region of low density.  As a result, a ''burn-in'' period is typically necessary,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bayesian data analysis |date=2004 |publisher=Chapman & Hall / CRC |others=Gelman, Andrew |isbn=978-1584883883 |edition= 2nd |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |oclc=51991499}}</ref> where an initial number of samples (e.g. the first 1000 or so) are thrown away.\n\nOn the other hand, most simple [[rejection sampling]] methods suffer from the \"[[curse of dimensionality]]\", where the probability of rejection increases exponentially as a function of the number of dimensions.  Metropolis\u2013Hastings, along with other MCMC methods, do not have this problem to such a degree, and thus are often the only solutions available when the number of dimensions of the distribution to be sampled is high.  As a result, MCMC methods are often the methods of choice for producing samples from [[hierarchical Bayesian model]]s and other high-dimensional statistical models used nowadays in many disciplines.\n\nIn [[multivariate distribution|multivariate]] distributions, the classic Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm as described above involves choosing a new multi-dimensional sample point.  When the number of dimensions is high, finding the suitable jumping distribution to use can be difficult, as the different individual dimensions behave in very different ways, and the jumping width (see above) must be \"just right\" for all dimensions at once to avoid excessively slow mixing.  An alternative approach that often works better in such situations, known as [[Gibbs sampling]], involves choosing a new sample for each dimension separately from the others, rather than choosing a sample for all dimensions at once.  This is especially applicable when the multivariate distribution is composed of a set of individual [[random variable]]s in which each variable is conditioned on only a small number of other variables, as is the case in most typical [[hierarchical Bayesian model|hierarchical models]].  The individual variables are then sampled one at a time, with each variable conditioned on the most recent values of all the others.  Various algorithms can be used to choose these individual samples, depending on the exact form of the multivariate distribution: some possibilities are the [[adaptive rejection sampling]] methods,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal |title = Concave-Convex Adaptive Rejection Sampling |journal = Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics |date = 2011-01-01 |issn = 1061-8600 |pages = 670\u2013691 |volume = 20 |issue = 3 |doi = 10.1198/jcgs.2011.09058 |first = Dilan |last = G\u00f6r\u00fcr |first2 = Yee Whye |last2 = Teh}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title = A Rejection Technique for Sampling from T-concave Distributions |journal = ACM Trans.

To accomplish this, the algorithm uses a [[Markov process]], which asymptotically reaches a unique [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|stationary distribution]] <math>\\pi(x)</math> such that <math>\\pi(x) = P(x)</math>.<ref name=Roberts_Casella/>\n\nA Markov process is uniquely defined by its transition probabilities <math>P(x' \\mid x)</math>, the probability of transitioning from any given state <math>x</math> to any other given state <math>x'</math>. It has a unique stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> when the following two conditions are met:<ref name=Roberts_Casella/>\n# ''Existence of stationary distribution'': there must exist a stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math>. A sufficient but not necessary condition is [[Markov chain#Reversible Markov chain|detailed balance]], which requires that each transition <math>x \\to x'</math> is reversible: for every pair of states <math>x, x'</math>, the probability of being in state <math>x</math> and transitioning to state <math>x'</math> must be equal to the probability of being in state <math>x'</math> and transitioning to state <math>x</math>, <math>\\pi(x) P(x' \\mid x) = \\pi(x') P(x \\mid x')</math>.\n# ''Uniqueness of stationary distribution'': the stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> must be unique. This is guaranteed by [[Markov Chain#Ergodicity|ergodicity]] of the Markov process, which requires that every state must (1) be aperiodic\u2014the system does not return to the same state at fixed intervals; and (2) be positive recurrent\u2014the expected number of steps for returning to the same state is finite.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm involves designing a Markov process (by constructing transition probabilities) that fulfills the two above conditions, such that its stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> is chosen to be <math>P(x)</math>. The derivation of the algorithm starts with the condition of detailed balance:\n\n: <math>P(x' \\mid x) P(x) = P(x \\mid x') P(x'),</math>\n\nwhich is re-written as\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(x' \\mid x)}{P(x \\mid x')} = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}.</math>\n\nThe approach is to separate the transition in two sub-steps; the proposal and the acceptance-rejection. The proposal distribution <math>g(x' \\mid x)</math> is the conditional probability of proposing a state <math>x'</math> given <math>x</math>, and the acceptance distribution <math>A(x', x)</math> is the probability to accept the proposed state <math>x'</math>. The transition probability can be written as the product of them:\n\n: <math>P(x'\\mid x) = g(x' \\mid x) A(x', x).</math>\n\nInserting this relation in the previous equation, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{A(x', x)}{A(x, x')} = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}\\frac{g(x \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x)}.</math>\n\nThe next step in the derivation is to choose an acceptance ratio that fulfills the condition above. One common choice is the Metropolis choice:\n\n: <math>A(x', x) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)} \\frac{g(x \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x)}\\right).</math>\n\nFor this Metropolis acceptance ratio <math>A</math>, either <math>A(x', x) = 1</math> or <math>A(x, x') = 1</math> and, either way, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm thus consists in the following:\n# Initialise \n## Pick an initial state <math>x_0</math>.\n## Set <math>t = 0</math>.\n# Iterate\n## ''Generate'' a random candidate state <math>x'</math> according to <math>g(x' \\mid x_t)</math>.\n## ''Calculate'' the acceptance probability <math>A(x', x_t) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)} \\frac{g(x_t \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x_t)}\\right)</math>;.\n## ''Accept or reject'':\n### generate a uniform random number <math>u \\in [0, 1]</math>;\n### if <math>u \\le A(x' , x_t)</math>, then ''accept'' the new state and set <math>x_{t+1} = x'</math>;\n### if <math>u >   A(x' , x_t)</math>, then ''reject'' the new state, and copy the old state forward <math>x_{t+1} = x_{t}</math>.\n## ''Increment'': set <math>t = t + 1</math>.\n\nProvided that specified conditions are met, the empirical distribution of saved states <math>x_0, \\ldots, x_T</math> will approach <math>P(x)</math>. The number of iterations (<math>T</math>) required to effectively estimate <math>P(x)</math> depends on the number of factors, including the relationship between <math>P(x)</math> and the proposal distribution and the desired accuracy of estimation.<ref>Raftery, Adrian E., and Steven Lewis. \"How Many Iterations in the Gibbs Sampler?\" ''In Bayesian Statistics 4''. 1992.</ref>  For distribution on discrete state spaces, it has to be of the order of the [[autocorrelation]] time of the Markov process.<ref name=Newman_Barkema/>\n\nIt is important to notice that it is not clear, in a general problem, which distribution <math>g(x' \\mid x)</math> one should use or the number of iterations necessary for proper estimation; both are free parameters of the method, which must be adjusted to the particular problem in hand.\n\n== Use in numerical integration ==\n\n{{main|Monte Carlo integration}}\n\nA common use of Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm is to compute an integral. Specifically, consider a space <math>\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}</math> and a probability distribution <math>P(x)</math> over <math>\\Omega</math>, <math>x \\in \\Omega</math>. Metropolis\u2013Hastings can estimate an integral of the form of\n\n: <math>P(E) = \\int_\\Omega A(x) P(x) \\,dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A(x)</math> is a (measurable) function of interest. \n\nFor example, consider a [[statistic]] <math>E(x)</math> and its probability distribution <math>P(E)</math>, which is a [[marginal distribution]]. Suppose that the goal is to estimate <math>P(E)</math> for <math>E</math> on the tail of <math>P(E)</math>. Formally, <math>P(E)</math> can be written as\n\n: <math>\nP(E) = \\int_\\Omega P(E\\mid x) P(x) \\,dx = \\int_\\Omega \\delta\\big(E - E(x)\\big) P(x) \\,dx = E \\big(P(E\\mid X)\\big)\n</math>\nand, thus, estimating <math>P(E)</math> can be accomplished by estimating the expected value of the [[indicator function]] <math>A_E(x) \\equiv \\mathbf{1}_E(x)</math>, which is 1 when <math>E(x) \\in [E, E + \\Delta E]</math> and zero otherwise.\nBecause <math>E</math> is on the tail of <math>P(E)</math>, the probability to draw a state <math>x</math> with <math>E(x)</math> on the tail of <math>P(E)</math> is proportional to <math>P(E)</math>, which is small by definition. The Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm can be used here to sample (rare) states more likely and thus increase the number of samples used to estimate <math>P(E)</math> on the tails. This can be done e.g. by using a sampling distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> to favor those states (e.g. <math>\\pi(x) \\propto e^{a E}</math> with <math>a > 0</math>).\n\n==Step-by-step instructions==\n\nSuppose that the most recent value sampled is <math>x_t</math>. To follow the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm, we next draw a new proposal state <math>x'</math> with probability density <math>g(x' \\mid x_t)</math> and calculate a value\n\n: <math>a = a_1 a_2,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>a_1 = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)}</math>\n\nis the probability (e.g., Bayesian posterior) ratio between the proposed sample <math>x'</math> and the previous sample <math>x_t</math>, and\n\n: <math>a_2 = \\frac{g(x_t \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x_t)}</math>\n\nis the ratio of the proposal density in two directions (from <math>x_t</math> to <math>x'</math> and conversely).\nThis is equal to 1 if the proposal density is symmetric.\nThen the new state <math>x_{t+1}</math> is chosen according to the following rules.\n\n: If <math>a \\geq 1{:}</math>\n:: <math>x_{t+1} = x',</math>\n: else:\n:: <math>x_{t+1} =\n \\begin{cases}\n  x' & \\text{with probability } a, \\\\\n  x_t & \\text{with probability } 1 - a.\n \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe Markov chain is started from an arbitrary initial value <math>x_0</math>, and the algorithm is run for many iterations until this initial state is \"forgotten\".  \nThese samples, which are discarded, are known as ''burn-in''. The remaining set of accepted values of <math>x</math> represent a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nThe algorithm works best if the proposal density matches the shape of the target distribution <math>P(x)</math>, from which direct sampling is difficult, that is <math>g(x' \\mid x_t) \\approx P(x')</math>.\nIf a Gaussian proposal density <math>g</math> is used, the variance parameter <math>\\sigma^2</math> has to be tuned during the burn-in period.\nThis is usually done by calculating the ''acceptance rate'', which is the fraction of proposed samples that is accepted in a window of the last <math>N</math> samples.\nThe desired acceptance rate depends on the target distribution, however it has been shown theoretically that the ideal acceptance rate for a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution is about 50%, decreasing to about 23% for an <math>N</math>-dimensional Gaussian target distribution.<ref name=Roberts/>\n\nIf <math>\\sigma^2</math> is too small, the chain will ''mix slowly'' (i.e., the acceptance rate will be high, but successive samples will move around the space slowly, and the chain will converge only slowly to <math>P(x)</math>).  On the other hand,\nif <math>\\sigma^2</math> is too large, the acceptance rate will be very low because the proposals are likely to land in regions of much lower probability density, so <math>a_1</math> will be very small, and again the chain will converge very slowly. One typically tunes the proposal distribution so that the algorithms accepts on the order of 30% of all samples \u2013 in line with the theoretical estimates mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n[[Image:3dRosenbrock.png|thumb|350px|The result of three [[Markov chain]]s running on the 3D [[Rosenbrock function]] using the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm.

This sequence can be used to approximate the distribution (e.g. to generate a [[histogram]]) or to [[Monte Carlo integration|compute an integral]] (e.g. an [[expected value]]).  Metropolis\u2013Hastings and other MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high.  For single-dimensional distributions, there are usually other methods (e.g. [[adaptive rejection sampling]]) that can directly return independent samples from the distribution, and these are free from the problem of [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] samples that is inherent in MCMC methods.\n\n==History==\nThe algorithm was named after [[Nicholas Metropolis]], who authored the 1953 article ''[[Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines]]'' together with [[Arianna W. Rosenbluth]], [[Marshall Rosenbluth]], [[Augusta H. Teller]] and [[Edward Teller]].  This article proposed the algorithm for the case of symmetrical proposal distributions, and [[W. K. Hastings]] extended it to the more general case in 1970.<ref name=Hastings/>\n\nSome controversy exists with regard to credit for development of the algorithm.  Metropolis had coined the term \"Monte Carlo\" in an earlier article with [[Stanislav Ulam]], was familiar with the computational aspects of the method, and led the group in the Theoretical Division that designed and built the [[MANIAC I]] computer used in the experiments in 1952.  However, prior to 2003, there was no detailed account of the algorithm's development.  Then, shortly before his death, [[Marshall Rosenbluth]] attended a 2003 conference at LANL marking the 50th anniversary of the 1953 publication.  At this conference, Rosenbluth described the algorithm and its development in a presentation titled \"Genesis of the Monte Carlo Algorithm for Statistical Mechanics\".<ref name=Rosenbluth/>  Further historical clarification is made by Gubernatis in a 2005 journal article<ref name=Gubernatis/> recounting the 50th anniversary conference. Rosenbluth makes it clear that he and his wife Arianna did the work, and that Metropolis played no role in the development other than providing computer time.\n\nThis contradicts an account by Edward Teller, who states in his memoirs that the five authors of the 1953 article worked together for \"days (and nights)\".<ref name=Teller/> In contrast, the detailed account by Rosenbluth credits Teller with a crucial but early suggestion to \"take advantage of statistical mechanics and take ensemble averages instead of following detailed kinematics\".  This, says Rosenbluth, started him thinking about the generalized Monte Carlo approach \u2013 a topic which he says he had discussed often with [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]].  Arianna recounted (to Gubernatis in 2003) that Augusta Teller started the computer work, but that Arianna herself took it over and wrote the code from scratch.  In an oral history recorded shortly before his death,<ref name=Barth/> Rosenbluth again credits Teller with posing the original problem, himself with solving it, and Arianna with programming the computer.  In terms of reputation, there is little reason to question Rosenbluth's account.  In a biographical memoir of Rosenbluth, [[Freeman Dyson]] writes:<ref name=Dyson/>\n{{Quote\n|text=Many times I came to Rosenbluth, asking him a question [...] and receiving an answer in two minutes.  Then it would usually take me a week of hard work to understand in detail why Rosenbluth's answer was right.  He had an amazing ability to see through a complicated physical situation and reach the right answer by physical arguments.  Enrico Fermi was the only other physicist I have known who was equal to Rosenbluth in his intuitive grasp of physics.\n}}\n\n==Intuition==\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm can draw samples from any [[probability distribution]] <math>P(x)</math>, provided that we know a function <math>f(x)</math> proportional to the [[Probability density function|density]] of <math>P</math> and the values of <math>f(x)</math> can be calculated. The requirement that <math>f(x)</math> must only be proportional to the density, rather than exactly equal to it, makes the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm particularly useful, because calculating the necessary normalization factor is often extremely difficult in practice.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm works by generating a sequence of sample values in such a way that, as more and more sample values are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>. These sample values are produced iteratively, with the distribution of the next sample being dependent only on the current sample value (thus making the sequence of samples into a [[Markov chain]]). Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next sample value based on the current sample value. Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)\u2014the probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function <math>f(x)</math> of the current and candidate sample values with respect to the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nFor the purpose of illustration, the Metropolis algorithm, a special case of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm where the proposal function is symmetric, is described below.\n<!---The sample values are linked in a [[Markov chain]], which means that the probability of each sample is conditionally independent of any earlier sample, given the sample immediately before it. In other words, \ngeneral idea is to generate a sequence of samples which are linked in a [[Markov chain]]; in other words, where each sample in the sequence is conditionally independent of any earlier sample, given the sample immediately before it. The procedure for choosing successive samples guarantees that the distribution of sample values will match the desired distribution ''P''(''x'') after a long time.!-->\n\n'''Metropolis algorithm (symmetric proposal distribution)'''\n\nLet <math>f(x)</math> be a function that is proportional to the desired probability distribution <math>P(x)</math> (a.k.a. a target distribution).\n\n# Initialization: Choose an arbitrary point <math>x_t</math> to be the first sample and choose an arbitrary probability density <math>g(x\\mid y)</math> (sometimes written <math>Q(x\\mid y)</math>) that suggests a candidate for the next sample value <math>x</math>, given the previous sample value <math>y</math>. In this section, <math>g</math> is assumed to be symmetric; in other words, it must satisfy <math>g(x\\mid y) = g(y\\mid x)</math>. A usual choice is to let <math>g(x\\mid y)</math> be a [[Gaussian distribution]] centered at <math>y</math>, so that points closer to <math>y</math> are more likely to be visited next, making the sequence of samples into a [[random walk]].  The function <math>g</math> is referred to as the ''proposal density'' or ''jumping distribution''.\n# For each iteration ''t'':\n#* ''Generate'' a candidate <math>x'</math> for the next sample by picking from the distribution <math>g(x'\\mid x_t)</math>.\n#* ''Calculate'' the ''acceptance ratio'' <math>\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t)</math>, which will be used to decide whether to accept or reject the candidate. Because ''f'' is proportional to the density of ''P'', we have that <math>\\alpha = f(x')/f(x_t) = P(x')/P(x_t)</math>.\n#* ''Accept or reject'': \n#** Generate a uniform random number <math>u \\in [0, 1]</math>.\n#** If <math>u \\le \\alpha</math>, then ''accept'' the candidate by setting <math>x_{t+1} = x'</math>,\n#** If <math>u > \\alpha</math>, then ''reject'' the candidate and set <math>x_{t+1} = x_t</math> instead.\n\nThis algorithm proceeds by randomly attempting to move about the sample space, sometimes accepting the moves and sometimes remaining in place.  Note that the acceptance ratio <math>\\alpha</math> indicates how probable the new proposed sample is with respect to the current sample, according to the distribution <math>P(x)</math>.  If we attempt to move to a point that is more probable than the existing point (i.e. a point in a higher-density region of <math>P(x)</math>), we will always accept the move.  However, if we attempt to move to a less probable point, we will sometimes reject the move, and the more the relative drop in probability, the more likely we are to reject the new point.  Thus, we will tend to stay in (and return large numbers of samples from) high-density regions of <math>P(x)</math>, while only occasionally visiting low-density regions.  Intuitively, this is why this algorithm works and returns samples that follow the desired distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nCompared with an algorithm like [[adaptive rejection sampling]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title = Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Gibbs Sampling |jstor = 2347565 |journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Even though over the long term they do correctly follow <math>P(x)</math>, a set of nearby samples will be correlated with each other and not correctly reflect the distribution.  This means that if we want a set of independent samples, we have to throw away the majority of samples and only take every ''n''th sample, for some value of ''n'' (typically determined by examining the [[autocorrelation]] between adjacent samples).  Autocorrelation can be reduced by increasing the ''jumping width'' (the average size of a jump, which is related to the variance of the jumping distribution), but this will also increase the likelihood of rejection of the proposed jump.  Too large or too small a jumping size will lead to a ''slow-mixing'' Markov chain, i.e. a highly correlated set of samples, so that a very large number of samples will be needed to get a reasonable estimate of any desired property of the distribution.\n* Although the Markov chain eventually converges to the desired distribution, the initial samples may follow a very different distribution, especially if the starting point is in a region of low density.  As a result, a ''burn-in'' period is typically necessary,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bayesian data analysis |date=2004 |publisher=Chapman & Hall / CRC |others=Gelman, Andrew |isbn=978-1584883883 |edition= 2nd |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |oclc=51991499}}</ref> where an initial number of samples (e.g. the first 1000 or so) are thrown away.\n\nOn the other hand, most simple [[rejection sampling]] methods suffer from the \"[[curse of dimensionality]]\", where the probability of rejection increases exponentially as a function of the number of dimensions.  Metropolis\u2013Hastings, along with other MCMC methods, do not have this problem to such a degree, and thus are often the only solutions available when the number of dimensions of the distribution to be sampled is high.  As a result, MCMC methods are often the methods of choice for producing samples from [[hierarchical Bayesian model]]s and other high-dimensional statistical models used nowadays in many disciplines.\n\nIn [[multivariate distribution|multivariate]] distributions, the classic Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm as described above involves choosing a new multi-dimensional sample point.  When the number of dimensions is high, finding the suitable jumping distribution to use can be difficult, as the different individual dimensions behave in very different ways, and the jumping width (see above) must be \"just right\" for all dimensions at once to avoid excessively slow mixing.  An alternative approach that often works better in such situations, known as [[Gibbs sampling]], involves choosing a new sample for each dimension separately from the others, rather than choosing a sample for all dimensions at once.  This is especially applicable when the multivariate distribution is composed of a set of individual [[random variable]]s in which each variable is conditioned on only a small number of other variables, as is the case in most typical [[hierarchical Bayesian model|hierarchical models]].  The individual variables are then sampled one at a time, with each variable conditioned on the most recent values of all the others.  Various algorithms can be used to choose these individual samples, depending on the exact form of the multivariate distribution: some possibilities are the [[adaptive rejection sampling]] methods,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal |title = Concave-Convex Adaptive Rejection Sampling |journal = Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics |date = 2011-01-01 |issn = 1061-8600 |pages = 670\u2013691 |volume = 20 |issue = 3 |doi = 10.1198/jcgs.2011.09058 |first = Dilan |last = G\u00f6r\u00fcr |first2 = Yee Whye |last2 = Teh}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title = A Rejection Technique for Sampling from T-concave Distributions |journal = ACM Trans.

To accomplish this, the algorithm uses a [[Markov process]], which asymptotically reaches a unique [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|stationary distribution]] <math>\\pi(x)</math> such that <math>\\pi(x) = P(x)</math>.<ref name=Roberts_Casella/>\n\nA Markov process is uniquely defined by its transition probabilities <math>P(x' \\mid x)</math>, the probability of transitioning from any given state <math>x</math> to any other given state <math>x'</math>. It has a unique stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> when the following two conditions are met:<ref name=Roberts_Casella/>\n# ''Existence of stationary distribution'': there must exist a stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math>. A sufficient but not necessary condition is [[Markov chain#Reversible Markov chain|detailed balance]], which requires that each transition <math>x \\to x'</math> is reversible: for every pair of states <math>x, x'</math>, the probability of being in state <math>x</math> and transitioning to state <math>x'</math> must be equal to the probability of being in state <math>x'</math> and transitioning to state <math>x</math>, <math>\\pi(x) P(x' \\mid x) = \\pi(x') P(x \\mid x')</math>.\n# ''Uniqueness of stationary distribution'': the stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> must be unique. This is guaranteed by [[Markov Chain#Ergodicity|ergodicity]] of the Markov process, which requires that every state must (1) be aperiodic\u2014the system does not return to the same state at fixed intervals; and (2) be positive recurrent\u2014the expected number of steps for returning to the same state is finite.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm involves designing a Markov process (by constructing transition probabilities) that fulfills the two above conditions, such that its stationary distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> is chosen to be <math>P(x)</math>. The derivation of the algorithm starts with the condition of detailed balance:\n\n: <math>P(x' \\mid x) P(x) = P(x \\mid x') P(x'),</math>\n\nwhich is re-written as\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(x' \\mid x)}{P(x \\mid x')} = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}.</math>\n\nThe approach is to separate the transition in two sub-steps; the proposal and the acceptance-rejection. The ''proposal distribution'' <math>g(x' \\mid x)</math> is the conditional probability of proposing a state <math>x'</math> given <math>x</math>, and the ''acceptance distribution'' <math>A(x', x)</math> is the probability to accept the proposed state <math>x'</math>. The transition probability can be written as the product of them:\n\n: <math>P(x'\\mid x) = g(x' \\mid x) A(x', x).</math>\n\nInserting this relation in the previous equation, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{A(x', x)}{A(x, x')} = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}\\frac{g(x \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x)}.</math>\n\nThe next step in the derivation is to choose an acceptance ratio that fulfills the condition above. One common choice is the Metropolis choice:\n\n: <math>A(x', x) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)} \\frac{g(x \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x)}\\right).</math>\n\nFor this Metropolis acceptance ratio <math>A</math>, either <math>A(x', x) = 1</math> or <math>A(x, x') = 1</math> and, either way, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThe Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm thus consists in the following:\n# Initialise \n## Pick an initial state <math>x_0</math>.\n## Set <math>t = 0</math>.\n# Iterate\n## ''Generate'' a random candidate state <math>x'</math> according to <math>g(x' \\mid x_t)</math>.\n## ''Calculate'' the acceptance probability <math>A(x', x_t) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)} \\frac{g(x_t \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x_t)}\\right)</math>;.\n## ''Accept or reject'':\n### generate a uniform random number <math>u \\in [0, 1]</math>;\n### if <math>u \\le A(x' , x_t)</math>, then ''accept'' the new state and set <math>x_{t+1} = x'</math>;\n### if <math>u >   A(x' , x_t)</math>, then ''reject'' the new state, and copy the old state forward <math>x_{t+1} = x_{t}</math>.\n## ''Increment'': set <math>t = t + 1</math>.\n\nProvided that specified conditions are met, the empirical distribution of saved states <math>x_0, \\ldots, x_T</math> will approach <math>P(x)</math>. The number of iterations (<math>T</math>) required to effectively estimate <math>P(x)</math> depends on the number of factors, including the relationship between <math>P(x)</math> and the proposal distribution and the desired accuracy of estimation.<ref>Raftery, Adrian E., and Steven Lewis. \"How Many Iterations in the Gibbs Sampler?\" ''In Bayesian Statistics 4''. 1992.</ref>  For distribution on discrete state spaces, it has to be of the order of the [[autocorrelation]] time of the Markov process.<ref name=Newman_Barkema/>\n\nIt is important to notice that it is not clear, in a general problem, which distribution <math>g(x' \\mid x)</math> one should use or the number of iterations necessary for proper estimation; both are free parameters of the method, which must be adjusted to the particular problem in hand.\n\n== Use in numerical integration ==\n\n{{main|Monte Carlo integration}}\n\nA common use of Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm is to compute an integral. Specifically, consider a space <math>\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}</math> and a probability distribution <math>P(x)</math> over <math>\\Omega</math>, <math>x \\in \\Omega</math>. Metropolis\u2013Hastings can estimate an integral of the form of\n\n: <math>P(E) = \\int_\\Omega A(x) P(x) \\,dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A(x)</math> is a (measurable) function of interest. \n\nFor example, consider a [[statistic]] <math>E(x)</math> and its probability distribution <math>P(E)</math>, which is a [[marginal distribution]]. Suppose that the goal is to estimate <math>P(E)</math> for <math>E</math> on the tail of <math>P(E)</math>. Formally, <math>P(E)</math> can be written as\n\n: <math>\nP(E) = \\int_\\Omega P(E\\mid x) P(x) \\,dx = \\int_\\Omega \\delta\\big(E - E(x)\\big) P(x) \\,dx = E \\big(P(E\\mid X)\\big)\n</math>\nand, thus, estimating <math>P(E)</math> can be accomplished by estimating the expected value of the [[indicator function]] <math>A_E(x) \\equiv \\mathbf{1}_E(x)</math>, which is 1 when <math>E(x) \\in [E, E + \\Delta E]</math> and zero otherwise.\nBecause <math>E</math> is on the tail of <math>P(E)</math>, the probability to draw a state <math>x</math> with <math>E(x)</math> on the tail of <math>P(E)</math> is proportional to <math>P(E)</math>, which is small by definition. The Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm can be used here to sample (rare) states more likely and thus increase the number of samples used to estimate <math>P(E)</math> on the tails. This can be done e.g. by using a sampling distribution <math>\\pi(x)</math> to favor those states (e.g. <math>\\pi(x) \\propto e^{a E}</math> with <math>a > 0</math>).\n\n==Step-by-step instructions==\n\nSuppose that the most recent value sampled is <math>x_t</math>. To follow the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm, we next draw a new proposal state <math>x'</math> with probability density <math>g(x' \\mid x_t)</math> and calculate a value\n\n: <math>a = a_1 a_2,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>a_1 = \\frac{P(x')}{P(x_t)}</math>\n\nis the probability (e.g., Bayesian posterior) ratio between the proposed sample <math>x'</math> and the previous sample <math>x_t</math>, and\n\n: <math>a_2 = \\frac{g(x_t \\mid x')}{g(x' \\mid x_t)}</math>\n\nis the ratio of the proposal density in two directions (from <math>x_t</math> to <math>x'</math> and conversely).\nThis is equal to 1 if the proposal density is symmetric.\nThen the new state <math>x_{t+1}</math> is chosen according to the following rules.\n\n: If <math>a \\geq 1{:}</math>\n:: <math>x_{t+1} = x',</math>\n: else:\n:: <math>x_{t+1} =\n \\begin{cases}\n  x' & \\text{with probability } a, \\\\\n  x_t & \\text{with probability } 1 - a.\n \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe Markov chain is started from an arbitrary initial value <math>x_0</math>, and the algorithm is run for many iterations until this initial state is \"forgotten\".  \nThese samples, which are discarded, are known as ''burn-in''. The remaining set of accepted values of <math>x</math> represent a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the distribution <math>P(x)</math>.\n\nThe algorithm works best if the proposal density matches the shape of the target distribution <math>P(x)</math>, from which direct sampling is difficult, that is <math>g(x' \\mid x_t) \\approx P(x')</math>.\nIf a Gaussian proposal density <math>g</math> is used, the variance parameter <math>\\sigma^2</math> has to be tuned during the burn-in period.\nThis is usually done by calculating the ''acceptance rate'', which is the fraction of proposed samples that is accepted in a window of the last <math>N</math> samples.\nThe desired acceptance rate depends on the target distribution, however it has been shown theoretically that the ideal acceptance rate for a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution is about 50%, decreasing to about 23% for an <math>N</math>-dimensional Gaussian target distribution.<ref name=Roberts/>\n\nIf <math>\\sigma^2</math> is too small, the chain will ''mix slowly'' (i.e., the acceptance rate will be high, but successive samples will move around the space slowly, and the chain will converge only slowly to <math>P(x)</math>).  On the other hand,\nif <math>\\sigma^2</math> is too large, the acceptance rate will be very low because the proposals are likely to land in regions of much lower probability density, so <math>a_1</math> will be very small, and again the chain will converge very slowly.
