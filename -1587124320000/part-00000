In the 3rd century CE it was superseded by the construction of the larger [[Aurelian Walls]] as the city of Rome grew beyond the boundary of the Servian Wall.\n\n==History==\nThe wall is named after the sixth [[Roman Kingdom|Roman King]], [[Servius Tullius]]. The literary tradition stating that there was some type of defensive wall or earthen works that encircled the city of Rome dating to the 6th century BCE has been found to be false.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Jesse Benedict|title=The evolution of the city of Rome from its origin to the Gallic catastrophe|publisher=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|year=1909|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}</ref> The main extent of the Servian Wall was built in the early 4th century, during what is known as the [[Roman Republic]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe Servian Wall was originally built from large blocks of Cappellaccio [[tuff]] (a volcanic rock made from ash and rock fragments that are ejected during a volcanic eruption) that was quarried from [[Alban Hills]] volcanic complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/archeosciences/2599?lang=en|title=The tuffs of the \"Servian Wall\"|last=Panei|first=Liliana|date=|website=Archeo-Sciences|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  After the Romans defeated [[Veii]] in the 390s the superior Grotta Oscura tuff was used instead.

This effectively thickened the wall and also gave the defenders of Rome a base to stand while repelling an attack. The wall was also outfitted with defensive war engines, including [[Catapult|catapult'''s''']]'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/AJA/22/2/Servian_Wall*.html|title=Notes on the Servian Wall|last=|first=|date=|website=American Journal of Archaeology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>'''.\n\n==Usage==\nThe Servian Wall was maintained through the end of the Late Republic and into the [[Roman Empire]]. By this time, Rome had already begun to outgrow the original boundaries of the Servian Wall.\n\nThe Servian Wall became unnecessary as Rome became well protected by the ever-expanding strength of the field armies Republic and of the later Empire. As the city continued to grow and prosper, Rome was essentially unwalled for the first three centuries of the Empire.

Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

It took a month later on May 13, 1997 when the SRN Fast Seacrafts, Inc. was formally organized, amended and registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].

The company was founded and headed by Hadji Ahmad W. Sakaluran as President and Hadji Wahab A. Amil his nephew in [[Zamboanga City]]. Established on April 17, 1997, it started with a vessel plying from Zamboanga City to [[Sandakan]], [[Malaysia]], and made them as one of the initial shipping companies plying the BIMP-EAGA route directly from Zamboanga City to Sandakan, Sabah, Malaysia and vice versa route. Weesam Express is now expanding their reach to [[Leyte]], [[Bohol]] and [[Bacolod]].\n\n== History ==\nIt was during the inaugural or maiden voyage of MS Express (a passenger ferry boat of A. Sakaluran Shipping Corporation) headed by Hadji Ahmad W. Sakaluran as their President, last February 19, 1997 and Hadji Wahab A. Amil, a nephew of Hadji Ahmad W. Sakaluran was a guest, that when they were able to conferred later, Hadji Ahmad W. Sakaluran suggested to Hadji Wahab A. Amil that he can also partake in this type of business as the sea is a big area for all of them. It was during this talk that my name was suggested by Hadji Ahmad W. Sakaluran to prepare all the documents necessary for an entity to operate a passenger ferry boat within Zamboanga City.\n\nThe Weesam Express was started last April 17, 1997, when the main proponent, Hadji Wahab A. Amil contacted the undersigned to create a company to operate a passenger ferry boat in southern Philippines. It took a month later on May 13, 1997 when the SRN Fast Seacrafts, Inc. was formally organized, amended and registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]]. SRN Fast Seacrafts was then working with the MV ''Lady Mary Joy 1'' of [[Aleson Shipping Lines]] as its \"Hepe De Viaje\" (Chief of the cruise). It was the only ship then plying the [[BIMP-EAGA]] route<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adb.org/sites/default/files/BIMP-EAGA-Roadmap-Development-2006-2010_0.pdf|title=BIMP-EAGA ROADMAP TO DEVELOPMENT 2006-2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.portcalls.com/development-of-15-sea-routes-to-bimp-eaga-eyed/#|title=Development of 15 sea routes to BIMP-EAGA eyed {{!}} PortCalls Asia {{!}} Asian Shipping and Maritime News|website=www.portcalls.com|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref> directly from [[Zamboanga City]] to [[Sandakan]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] and vice versa route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thephilsouthangle.com/?p=6476|title=Zamboanga-Sandakan Route {{!}} The PhilSouth Angle|website=thephilsouthangle.com|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> A few days later, the undersigned arrived from [[Sandakan]] which prompted the beginning of organizing a company to manage a passenger ferry boat.\n\nAs for the passenger ferry boat acquisition, contact were made with Yong Choo Kui, owner of the Yong Choo Kui Shipyard. at Sibu, [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. The first passenger steel hull boat was acquired from the operator of the Bullet Express, Upon acquisition, it was renamed as MV ''Weesam Express'', named after the youngest son of Hadji Wahab A. Amil, Weesam. The inaugural voyage of the seacraft was on September 21, 1997, from Zamboanga City to Jolo, Sulu.\n\nThey soon expanded to Visayan waters with the acquisition of their succeeding Weesam ships. New routes included Cebu City to Ormoc and Cebu City to Dumaguete to Dapitan. However, their Zamboanga City - Sandakan, Malaysia route was later abandoned due to [[Aleson Shipping Lines Inc.|Aleson Shipping Lines]] cheaper rates. Later on, they introduced new routes for Basilan through [[Zamboanga City]] - [[Isabela City, Basilan|Isabela City]] route.\n\nToday, they are now in concentration of developing their existing routes, including their launch to their online booking<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/weesamexpressofficial|title=Weesam Express Page {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weesam.ph/|title=Home - Weesam Express|website=Weesam Express|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref> through [[Facebook]] and developing their terminals on the ports where they're serving at.\n\n== Ports of call ==\nAll of Weesam Express's are registered for the [[Port of Zamboanga]].
