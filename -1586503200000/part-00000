Between 1,400 and 2,000 sailors lost their lives aboard the wrecked vessels, making the incident one of the worst maritime disasters in British naval history.<ref name=EarlySources> The earliest reports of the disaster appeared in the [[Daily Courant]], and were rather brief. The account for 1 November 1707 read: \"an Account, that Sir Cloudsly Shovel with about 20 Sail of Men of War coming from the Streights, having made an Observation the 21st, lay the 22d from 12 to about 6 in the Afternoon; but the Weather being very hazy and rainy and Night coming on dark, the Wind being S.S.W, they Stearing E by N, supposing they had the Channel open, were some of them upon the Rocks to the Westward of Scilly before they were aware, about 8 a Clock at Night.

Great Britain dispatched a fleet to provide naval support led by the [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleets]], [[Cloudesley Shovell|Sir Cloudesley Shovell]]. The ships sailed to the Mediterranean, attacked Toulon and managed to inflict damage on the French fleet caught in the siege. However, the overall campaign was unsuccessful, and the British fleet was ordered to return home, setting sail from [[Gibraltar]] for [[Portsmouth]] in late September.

As the fleet sailed out on the [[Atlantic]], passing the [[Bay of Biscay]] on their way to England, the weather worsened, and on most days it was impossible to take the observations needed to determine their latitude. On 21 October they came into the soundings, with depths of 93-130 fathoms (about 170-240 metres), indicating that they were coming onto the edge of the continental shelf<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stuart |title=Sir Cloudesley Shovell Stuart Admiral |date=2001 |publisher=Spellmount |location=Staplehurst |page=332}}</ref>.

A small memorial was later erected at this site. The circumstances under which the admiral's remains were found gave rise to stories (see below). Shovell was temporarily buried on the beach on St Mary's ([https://archive.is/20120913024516/http://www.submerged.co.uk/association%205%20big.jpg see image]).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120913024516/http://www.submerged.co.uk/association%205%20big.jpg A photograph by Frank W.Gibson] of Admiral Shovell's temporary grave in Porthellick Cove.</ref> By order of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] his body was later exhumed, embalmed and taken to London where he was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=submerged/> His large marble monument in the south choir aisle was sculpted by [[Grinling Gibbons]].<ref name=\"westminster\"/> There is a memorial depicting the sinking of the ''Association'' in the church at the Narboroughs' home of [[Knowlton, Kent|Knowlton]] near Dover.\n\n==Legends of the disaster==\nA number of myths and legends have arisen concerning the disaster. The story about Shovell summoning the sailing masters to the flagship on 22 October seems to have first appeared in a paper by James Herbert Cooke presented at a meeting of the Royal Society of Antiquaries in 1883, based on an account by Edmund Herbert who was on the Isles of Scilly in 1709. Although such a council was not in itself improbable, it would have been a significant operation, involving the launching of the ships' boats in heavy weather, and it would be expected to be recorded in the ships' logs. The surviving logs do indeed record previous such events, but no mention is made of a council on the 22nd<ref name=pickwell>{{cite journal |first=J. G. |last=Pickwell |title=Improbable Legends surrounding Sir Clowdisley Shovell |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=59 |issue=2 |date=1973 |pages=221\u2013223 |doi=10.1080/00253359.1973.10657899}}</ref>.\n\nAnother myth associated with the disaster alleges that a common sailor on the flagship tried to warn Shovell that the fleet was off course but the Admiral had him hanged at the [[yardarm]] for inciting mutiny. The story first appeared in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native who recognised the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the Admiral. It was claimed that grass will never grow on the grave where Shovell was first buried at Porthellick Cove because of his tyrannical act against an islander. The myth was embellished in the 19th century when the punishment became instant execution and the sailor's knowledge of the fleet's position was attributed to superior navigational skills instead of local knowledge. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate, such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by [[Samuel Pepys]] in 1684. Naval historians have repeatedly discredited the story, noting the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins.<ref name=cooke/><ref name=powell>{{cite journal |last=Damer Powell |first=J. W. |title=Notes: The Wreck of Sir Cloudesley Shovell |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=43 |issue=4|date=1957 |pages=333\u2013336|doi=10.1080/00253359.1957.10658366}}</ref><ref name=pickwell/> However, the myth was revived in 1997 when author [[Dava Sobel]] presented it as an unqualified truth in her book ''[[Longitude (book)|Longitude]]''.{{r|Longitude|page1=11-16}}\n\nAnother story that is often told is that Shovell was alive, at least barely, when he reached the shore of Scilly at Porthellick Cove, but was murdered by a woman for the sake of his priceless [[emerald]] ring, which had been given to him by a close friend, Captain [[James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley|James Lord Dursley]]. At that time, the Scillies had a wild and lawless reputation.<ref name=legacy/> According to a letter written in 1709 by Edmund Herbert, who was sent to Scilly by Shovell's family to help locate and recover items belonging to the admiral, Sir Cloudesley's body was first found by two women \"stript of his shirt\" and \"his ring was also lost off his hand, which however left ye impression on his finger.\"  Shovell's widow, Elizabeth, had offered a large reward for the recovery of any family property.<ref name=\"legacy\"/> It is claimed that the murder only came to light some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, produced the stolen ring and confessed to a clergyman that she had killed the admiral.<ref name=\"Longitude\"/> The clergyman supposedly sent it back to the [[James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley|3rd Earl of Berkeley]],<ref name=royalnavalmuseum>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_cloudesley_shovell.htm|title=Biography: Cloudesley Shovell|website=Royal Naval Museum|date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> although several historians doubt the murder legend as there is no record of the ring's return and the story stems from a romantic and unverifiable \"deathbed confession\".<ref name=powell/><ref name=pickwell/>\n\n==Longitude and latitude==\nThere was much discussion of the difficulties facing mariners approaching the channel in the years both before and after the Scilly disaster. In 1700, Edmond Halley published an \"advertisement\" (warning) concerning the dangers of ships mistakenly passing north of Scilly, rather than to the south, as intended, \"not without great danger, and the loss of many of them\". He identified two factors, the failure to take account of magnetic variation, then about 7\u00b0 west, and errors in the pilot books, placing the islands up to 15 miles north of their true position. He recommended a course not more northerly than 49\u00b0 40' to stay safely to the south of both the Scillies and the Lizard<ref name=Halley>{{cite journal |last1=Halley |first1=Edmond |title=An Advertisement Necessary for All Navigators Bound up the Channel of England |journal=Philosophical Transactions |date=1700 |volume=22 |pages=725\u2013726 |jstor=102790 }}</ref>. Another possible factor, suspected by some mariners at the time, but not documented for nearly another 100 years was the existence of a north-setting current, Rennell's Current, that could run at 15 miles in 24 hours, quite sufficient to put a ship into danger. The current builds up with strong westerly or south-westerly winds, as was the case in October 1707<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rennell |first1=James |title=Observations on a current that often prevails to the westward of Scilly; endangering the safety of ships that approach the British Channel |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1793 |volume=83 |pages=182\u2013201 |url=https://archive.org/details/rennell1793philosophicaltra8317roya}}</ref><ref name=Marcus/>.\n\nWriting about the Scilly disaster in 1720, Josiah Burchett wrote: \"I cannot but have a lively idea of the danger fleets are exposed to upon entering the British Channel, when coming from foreign parts, but more especially when their officers have not the advantage of knowing their latitude by a good observation\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burchett |first1=Josiah |title=Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea |date=1720 |publisher=J. Walthoe |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/completehistoryo00burc/page/733 733] |url=https://archive.org/details/completehistoryo00burc}}</ref>.  Thus both these writers identified the importance of errors in latitude.\n\nLongitude was also, obviously, important for a ship approaching the channel. Before astronomical methods of determining longitude became available, navigators used soundings of the ocean depth with lead and line. The continental shelf extends to about the 100 fathom line (180 m) then drops very sharply to thousands of metres. A ship coming \"into the soundings\", where the depth could be measured with a 100-150 fathom sounding line thus knew its approximate longitude.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kemp |first1=John |title=The Cinderella Navigation Aid The use of the Lead and Line in British ships from the 16th to 20th Century |journal=Journal of Navigation |date=2017 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=671\u2013685 |doi=10.1017/S0373463316000862 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/cinderella-navigation-aid-the-use-of-the-lead-and-line-in-british-ships-from-the-16th-to-20th-century/54E0A4523ABE0B0ED76EE7826A786D68}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scilly naval disaster 1707 Track.jpg|thumb|October 1707.

It has sometimes been assumed that the bad weather on the voyage prevented the determination of latitude, but the weather cleared enough for some observations to be made. Thus the positions calculated are a mixture of dead reckoning, soundings, and observations of latitude. The approximate course of the fleet is shown at right, with positions shown for the last two days from the logs of ships that survived the disaster. The chart also shows Halley's recommended northern limit. They were clearly too far north to continue heading E by N. Again, this suggests an error in latitude. May notes that while the latitudes recorded in the log-books was more accurate than the longitudes, there was still a spread of over 40 nautical miles in the recorded latitudes {{r|May1960|p=331}}.\n\nH.M.S. Orford, and Lieutenant Lochard's log, survived the disaster. H.M.S. Association and her logs did not, so we have no way of knowing exactly what information Shovell had. The account of a council of the ships' masters that discussed their position is almost certainly one of the myths of the disaster, as suggested above. But if Shovell headed E by N towards the Channel at night-time, he presumably believed he was safely to the south of the Scillies<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=William E. |title=The British longitude act reconsidered |journal=American Scientist |date=2012 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=102\u2013105|doi=10.1511/2012.95.102 }}</ref>.

The Royal Navy conducted a court-martial of the officers of the Firebrand, who were acquitted, but no officers survived from the other lost ships, so no other courts-martial took place. The Navy also conducted a survey of compasses from the surviving ships and of those at Chatham and Portsmouth dockyards, following comments from Sir William Jumper, captain of the Lenox, that errors in the compasses had caused the navigational error. This showed what a poor state many were in; at Portsmouth, for example, only four of the 112 wooden cased compasses from nine of the returning vessels were found to be serviceable<ref>{{cite journal |first=W.

As transoceanic travel grew in significance, so did the importance of reliable navigation. While no contemporary discussions are known that appear to have related the disaster to longitude, concern about navigation led to the Longitude Act in 1714<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1707 Isles of Scilly Disaster \u2013 Part 1 |url=https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/1707-isles-scilly-disaster-%E2%80%93-part-1 |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The 1707 Isles of Scilly Disaster \u2013 Part 2 |url=https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/1707-isles-scilly-disaster-%E2%80%93-part-2 |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>. This established the Board of Longitude and offered large financial rewards for anyone who could find a method of determining longitude accurately at sea. After many years, the consequence of the Act was that accurate [[Marine_chronometer|marine chronometers]] were produced and the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]] was developed, both of which became used throughout the world for navigation at sea.\n\n==Discovery of the wrecks==\nThe ships of Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet lay undisturbed on the seabed for over 250 years,<ref name=\"wreck\"/> despite several salvage attempts in pursuit of the flagship's cargo of valuable coins, [[Prize of war|spoils of war]] from several battles, weapons, and personal effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukdiving.co.uk/places/coastal/articles/scilly4.htm |title=HMS ''Association |website=ukdiving.co.uk |accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref> In June 1967, the Royal Navy [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{HMS|Puttenham|M2784|6}}, manned with twelve divers under the command of [[Engineer Officer (Royal Navy)|Engineer-Lieutenant]] Roy Graham, sailed to the Isles of Scilly and dropped anchor off Gilstone Ledge, just to the southeast of [[Bishop Rock, Isles of Scilly|Bishop Rock]]<ref name=Farrell>{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Nigel |authorlink=Nigel Farrell |title=An Island Parish.

Great Britain dispatched a fleet to provide naval support led by the [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleets]], [[Cloudesley Shovell|Sir Cloudesley Shovell]]. The ships sailed to the Mediterranean, attacked Toulon and managed to inflict damage on the French fleet caught in the siege. However, the overall campaign was unsuccessful, and the British fleet was ordered to return home, setting sail from [[Gibraltar]] for [[Portsmouth]] in late September.

As the fleet sailed out on the [[Atlantic]], passing the [[Bay of Biscay]] on their way to England, the weather worsened, and on most days it was impossible to take the observations needed to determine their latitude. On 21 October they came into the soundings, with depths of 93-130 fathoms (about 170-240 metres), indicating that they were coming onto the edge of the continental shelf<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stuart |title=Sir Cloudesley Shovell Stuart Admiral |date=2001 |publisher=Spellmount |location=Staplehurst |page=332}}</ref>.

At 4 p.m. on the 22nd, the fleet hove-to and again took soundings. The wind continued to be favourable, though visibility was poor and night was approaching.

The story about Shovell summoning the sailing masters to the flagship on 22 October seems to have first appeared in a paper by James Herbert Cooke presented at a meeting of the Royal Society of Antiquaries in 1883, based on an account by Edmund Herbert who was on the Isles of Scilly in 1709. Although such a council was not in itself improbable, it would have been a significant operation, involving the launching of the ships' boats in heavy weather, and it would be expected to be recorded in the ships' logs. The surviving logs do indeed record previous such events, but no mention is made of a council on the 22nd<ref name=pickwell>{{cite journal |first=J. G. |last=Pickwell |title=Improbable Legends surrounding Sir Clowdisley Shovell |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=59 |issue=2 |date=1973 |pages=221\u2013223 |doi=10.1080/00253359.1973.10657899}}</ref>.\n\nAnother myth associated with the disaster alleges that a common sailor on the flagship tried to warn Shovell that the fleet was off course but the Admiral had him hanged at the [[yardarm]] for inciting mutiny. The story first appeared in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native who recognised the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the Admiral. It was claimed that grass will never grow on the grave where Shovell was first buried at Porthellick Cove because of his tyrannical act against an islander. The myth was embellished in the 19th century when the punishment became instant execution and the sailor's knowledge of the fleet's position was attributed to superior navigational skills instead of local knowledge. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate, such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by [[Samuel Pepys]] in 1684. Naval historians have repeatedly discredited the story, noting the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins.<ref name=cooke/><ref name=powell>{{cite journal |last=Damer Powell |first=J.

At that time, the Scillies had a wild and lawless reputation.<ref name=legacy/> According to a letter written in 1709 by Edmund Herbert, who was sent to Scilly by Shovell's family to help locate and recover items belonging to the admiral, Sir Cloudesley's body was first found by two women \"stript of his shirt\" and \"his ring was also lost off his hand, which however left ye impression on his finger.\"  Shovell's widow, Elizabeth, had offered a large reward for the recovery of any family property.<ref name=\"legacy\"/> It is claimed that the murder only came to light some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, produced the stolen ring and confessed to a clergyman that she had killed the admiral.<ref name=\"Longitude\"/> The clergyman supposedly sent it back to the [[James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley|3rd Earl of Berkeley]],<ref name=royalnavalmuseum>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_cloudesley_shovell.htm|title=Biography: Cloudesley Shovell|website=Royal Naval Museum|date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> although several historians doubt the murder legend as there is no record of the ring's return and the story stems from a romantic and unverifiable \"deathbed confession\".<ref name=powell/><ref name=pickwell/>\n\n==Longitude and latitude==\nThere was much discussion of the difficulties facing mariners approaching the channel in the years both before and after the Scilly disaster. In 1700, Edmond Halley published an \"advertisement\" (warning) concerning the dangers of ships mistakenly passing north of Scilly, rather than to the south, as intended, \"not without great danger, and the loss of many of them\". He identified two factors, the failure to take account of magnetic variation, then about 7\u00b0 west, and errors in the pilot books, placing the islands up to 15 miles north of their true position. He recommended a course not more northerly than 49\u00b0 40' to stay safely to the south of both the Scillies and the Lizard<ref name=Halley>{{cite journal |last1=Halley |first1=Edmond |title=An Advertisement Necessary for All Navigators Bound up the Channel of England |journal=Philosophical Transactions |date=1700 |volume=22 |pages=725\u2013726 |jstor=102790 }}</ref>. Another possible factor, suspected by some mariners at the time, but not documented for nearly another 100 years was the existence of a north-setting current, Rennell's Current, that could run at 15 miles in 24 hours, quite sufficient to put a ship into danger. The current builds up with strong westerly or south-westerly winds, as was the case in October 1707<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rennell |first1=James |title=Observations on a current that often prevails to the westward of Scilly; endangering the safety of ships that approach the British Channel |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1793 |volume=83 |pages=182\u2013201 |url=https://archive.org/details/rennell1793philosophicaltra8317roya}}</ref><ref name=Marcus/>.\n\nWriting about the Scilly disaster in 1720, Josiah Burchett wrote: \"I cannot but have a lively idea of the danger fleets are exposed to upon entering the British Channel, when coming from foreign parts, but more especially when their officers have not the advantage of knowing their latitude by a good observation\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burchett |first1=Josiah |title=Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea |date=1720 |publisher=J. Walthoe |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/completehistoryo00burc/page/733 733] |url=https://archive.org/details/completehistoryo00burc}}</ref>.  Thus both these writers identified the importance of errors in latitude.\n\nLongitude was also, obviously, important for a ship approaching the channel. Before astronomical methods of determining longitude became available, navigators used soundings of the ocean depth with lead and line. The continental shelf extends to about the 100 fathom line (180 m) then drops very sharply to thousands of metres. A ship coming \"into the soundings\", where the depth could be measured with a 100-150 fathom sounding line thus knew its approximate longitude.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kemp |first1=John |title=The Cinderella Navigation Aid The use of the Lead and Line in British ships from the 16th to 20th Century |journal=Journal of Navigation |date=2017 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=671\u2013685 |doi=10.1017/S0373463316000862 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/cinderella-navigation-aid-the-use-of-the-lead-and-line-in-british-ships-from-the-16th-to-20th-century/54E0A4523ABE0B0ED76EE7826A786D68}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scilly naval disaster 1707 Track.jpg|thumb|October 1707.

It has sometimes been assumed that the bad weather on the voyage prevented the determination of latitude, but the weather cleared enough for some observations to be made. Thus the positions calculated are a mixture of dead reckoning, soundings, and observations of latitude. The approximate course of the fleet is shown at right, with positions shown for the last two days from the logs of ships that survived the disaster. The chart also shows Halley's recommended northern limit. They were clearly too far north to continue heading E by N. Again, this suggests an error in latitude. May notes that while the latitudes recorded in the log-books was more accurate than the longitudes, there was still a spread of over 40 nautical miles in the recorded latitudes {{r|May1960|p=331}}.\n\nH.M.S. Orford, and Lieutenant Lochard's log, survived the disaster. H.M.S. Association and her logs did not, so we have no way of knowing exactly what information Shovell had. The account of a council of the ships' masters that discussed their position is almost certainly one of the myths of the disaster, as suggested above. But if Shovell headed E by N towards the Channel at night-time, he presumably believed he was safely to the south of the Scillies<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=William E. |title=The British longitude act reconsidered |journal=American Scientist |date=2012 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=102\u2013105|doi=10.1511/2012.95.102 }}</ref>.

The Royal Navy conducted a court-martial of the officers of the Firebrand, who were acquitted, but no officers survived from the other lost ships, so no other courts-martial took place. The Navy also conducted a survey of compasses from the surviving ships and of those at Chatham and Portsmouth dockyards, following comments from Sir William Jumper, captain of the Lenox, that errors in the compasses had caused the navigational error. This showed what a poor state many were in; at Portsmouth, for example, only four of the 112 wooden cased compasses from nine of the returning vessels were found to be serviceable<ref>{{cite journal |first=W.

As transoceanic travel grew in significance, so did the importance of reliable navigation. While no contemporary discussions are known that appear to have related the disaster to longitude, concern about navigation led to the Longitude Act in 1714<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1707 Isles of Scilly Disaster \u2013 Part 1 |url=https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/1707-isles-scilly-disaster-%E2%80%93-part-1 |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The 1707 Isles of Scilly Disaster \u2013 Part 2 |url=https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/1707-isles-scilly-disaster-%E2%80%93-part-2 |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>. This established the Board of Longitude and offered large financial rewards for anyone who could find a method of determining longitude accurately at sea. After many years, the consequence of the Act was that accurate [[Marine_chronometer|marine chronometers]] were produced and the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]] was developed, both of which became used throughout the world for navigation at sea.\n\n==Discovery of the wrecks==\nThe ships of Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet lay undisturbed on the seabed for over 250 years,<ref name=\"wreck\"/> despite several salvage attempts in pursuit of the flagship's cargo of valuable coins, [[Prize of war|spoils of war]] from several battles, weapons, and personal effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukdiving.co.uk/places/coastal/articles/scilly4.htm |title=HMS ''Association |website=ukdiving.co.uk |accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref> In June 1967, the Royal Navy [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{HMS|Puttenham|M2784|6}}, manned with twelve divers under the command of [[Engineer Officer (Royal Navy)|Engineer-Lieutenant]] Roy Graham, sailed to the Isles of Scilly and dropped anchor off Gilstone Ledge, just to the southeast of [[Bishop Rock, Isles of Scilly|Bishop Rock]]<ref name=Farrell>{{cite book |last=Farrell |first=Nigel |authorlink=Nigel Farrell |title=An Island Parish.

It was written by [[Casey Alexander (cartoonist)|Casey Alexander]], [[Zeus Cervas]], [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]], [[Steven Banks]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], and the animation was directed by supervising director, [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]]. Alexander, Cervas and Mitchell also function as [[storyboard]] directors. The episode originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on April 13, 2007.\n\nThe series follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, [[Mr. Krabs]] reveals to [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] that he and his business rival [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]] were actually [[best friend (friendship)|best friends]] during their childhood. Through a series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Mr. Krabs tells the story of how that friendship deteriorated, the cause of their rivalry, how Mr. Krabs became bad guy, how Plankton became his enemy, and how the Krabby Patty sandwich was created in the process. The episode became available on DVD on April 17, 2007. \"Friend or Foe\" received positive reviews upon release.\n\n==Plot==\n===Patchy the Pirate Subplot===\nPatchy and Potty are working at a restaurant called \"Poop Deck,\" hoping to be just like [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]]. Patchy has new ideas (he makes three burgers of his own he calls \"Buried Treasure\", Walk-the-Plank\", and the \"Patchy Patty\") which Potty disagrees with, and after an argument with Potty, Patchy ends their friendship and goes home. He compares himself and Potty to [[Mr. Krabs]] and [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]], starting the SpongeBob Plot. \n\nLater, Potty appears to Patchy and tells him that he is now assistant manager. Potty says that his fancy book smarts got him the promotion and Patchy thinks it's unfair. When Patchy realizes his food is terrible, Potty tells him that he needs to practice his cooking skills. After a montage of training, Patchy makes his first burger. He tries it and realizes it's just as bad and has it walk the plank (in other words, throw it into the garbage).  Patchy shrugs and says that SpongeBob's first patty probably didn't go so well. However, Potty shows SpongeBob (as a baby) making his first patty and it's perfect on the first try. \n\nPotty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary environment (such as keeping ground beef in an old boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch the rest of the SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.\n\nAfter the episode is over, Patchy claims he took some time off, but Potty then tells the viewers that Patchy actually got fired, and Patchy gets back at Potty by saying that he got fired too, which is also true (but Potty also got a golden parachute). Patchy then says that they cannot replace him, but Potty tells him that they already did. When Patchy finds out that he's been replaced by a gorilla, he calls it a \"smelly, hairy fleabag\", to which the gorilla fiercely responds to by throwing patties at Patchy. The narrator then tell the Viewers to always follow your dreams (unless you're Patchy), and then the episode ends. \n\n===Main Plot===\nAfter yet another attack at the [[Krusty Krab]] by [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] asks [[Mr. Krabs]] why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells his side of the story, in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did everything together. Both were outcasts, Plankton being viewed as a nerd for his intelligence and Mr. Krabs (ironically) being extremely poor, and victims of cold-hearted ridicule and social prejudice by other children. One day, Mr. Krabs finds a penny at the carnival, his first exposure to money, which he spends on a balloon for Plankton. Later, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a [[landfill]], is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger, saying that freaks like them are bad for business, Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but no one wants to try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open \"Plabs Burgers\" at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.\n\nBack at the Krusty Krab, Plankton comes in and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story is the same as Mr. Krab's, except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Krabs wanting to rule the money of the children and when they disagreed shot Plankton out of a straw into the dump. Plankton and Krabs begin arguing about the story, until [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)#Karen|Karen]] arrives and tells the real story. In the story, the restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins, an elderly resident and an old friend of Krab's family, is the first to try their burger, but collapses, having been poisoned by the patty. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two. Their friendship over, Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. Mr. Krabs' \"Krabby Patty\" became a success, while Plankton's Chum Burger is horrible, making him to swear stealing the formula and taking revenge.\n\nAfter hearing the story, Plankton and Krabs begin to make up, until Plankton takes the formula from his pocket.

It was written by [[Casey Alexander (cartoonist)|Casey Alexander]], [[Zeus Cervas]], [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]], [[Steven Banks]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], and the animation was directed by supervising director, [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]]. Alexander, Cervas and Mitchell also function as [[storyboard]] directors. The episode originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on April 13, 2007.\n\nThe series follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, [[Mr. Krabs]] reveals to [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] that he and his business rival [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]] were actually [[best friend (friendship)|best friends]] during their childhood. Through a series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Mr. Krabs tells the story of how that friendship deteriorated, the cause of their rivalry, how Mr. Krabs became bad guy, how Plankton became his enemy, and how the Krabby Patty sandwich was created in the process. The episode became available on DVD on April 17, 2007. \"Friend or Foe\" received positive reviews upon release.\n\n==Plot==\n===Patchy the Pirate Subplot===\nPatchy and Potty are working at a restaurant called \"Poop Deck,\" hoping to be just like [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]]. Patchy has new ideas (he makes three burgers of his own he calls \"Buried Treasure\", Walk-the-Plank\", and the \"Patchy Patty\") which Potty disagrees with, and after an argument with Potty, Patchy ends their friendship and goes home. He compares himself and Potty to [[Mr. Krabs]] and [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]], starting the SpongeBob Plot. \n\nLater, Potty appears to Patchy and tells him that he is now assistant manager. Potty says that his fancy book smarts got him the promotion and Patchy thinks it's unfair. When Patchy realizes his food is terrible, Potty tells him that he needs to practice his cooking skills. After a montage of training, Patchy makes his first burger. He tries it and realizes it's just as bad and has it walk the plank (in other words, throw it into the garbage).  Patchy shrugs and says that SpongeBob's first patty probably didn't go so well. However, Potty shows SpongeBob (as a baby) making his first patty and it's perfect on the first try. \n\nPotty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary environment (such as keeping ground beef in an old boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch the rest of the SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.\n\nAfter the episode is over, Patchy claims he took some time off, but Potty then tells the viewers that Patchy actually got fired, and Patchy gets back at Potty by saying that he got fired too, which is also true (but Potty also got a golden parachute). Patchy then says that they cannot replace him, but Potty tells him that they already did. When Patchy finds out that he's been replaced by a gorilla, he calls it a \"smelly, hairy fleabag\", to which the gorilla fiercely responds to by throwing patties at Patchy. The narrator then tell the Viewers to always follow your dreams (unless you're Patchy), and then the episode ends. \n\n===Main Plot===\nAfter yet another attack at the [[Krusty Krab]] by [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] asks [[Mr. Krabs]] why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells his side of the story, in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did everything together. Both were outcasts, Plankton being viewed as a nerd for his intelligence and Mr. Krabs (ironically) being extremely poor, and victims of cold-hearted ridicule and social prejudice by other children. One day, Mr. Krabs finds a penny at the carnival, his first exposure to money, which he spends on a balloon for Plankton. Later, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a [[landfill]], is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger, saying that freaks like them are bad for business, Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but no one wants to try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open \"Plabs Burgers\" at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.\n\nBack at the Krusty Krab, Plankton comes in and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story is the same as Mr. Krab's, except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Krabs wanting to rule the money of the children and when they disagreed shot Plankton out of a straw into the dump. Plankton and Krabs begin arguing about the story, until [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)#Karen|Karen]] arrives and tells the real story. In the story, the restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins, an elderly resident and an old friend of Krab's family, is the first to try their burger, but collapses, having been poisoned by the patty. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two. Their friendship over, Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. Mr. Krabs' \"Krabby Patty\" became a success, while Plankton's Chum Burger is horrible, making him to swear stealing the formula and taking revenge.\n\nAfter hearing the story, Plankton and Krabs begin to make up, until Plankton takes the formula from his pocket. Then the two start chasing after each other.\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Kenny]] - [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]], Kid #5, Kid #2, [[Patchy the Pirate]]\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] - Mr. Pirateson\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] - [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]\n* [[Clancy Brown]] - [[Mr. Krabs]]\n* [[Mr. Lawrence]] - [[Plankton (SpongeBob)|Plankton]], Kid #4, Kid #5\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] - Kid #1, Old Man Jenkins, Male 1, Kid #3\n* [[Jill Talley]] - [[Karen Plankton|Karen]], Girl Fish, Customer\n* [[Sirena Irwin]] - Kid #2, Kid #3, Mama Krabs\n* [[Tom Wilson]] - Stinky\n* [[Paul Tibbitt]] - [[Gorilla]], Potty\n* [[Tom Fountain]] - Potty Puppeteer\n* [[Kevin Carlson]] - Rat Puppeteer\n* [[Christian Papalexis]] - Potty Puppeteer\n\n== Portrayed by ==\n* [[Rugrats]]\n\n==Production==\n\"Friend or Foe\" is a [[television special|special episode]] written by [[Casey Alexander (cartoonist)|Casey Alexander]], [[Zeus Cervas]], [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]], [[Steven Banks]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], with [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]] serving as [[animation director]]s.

In the years 1922-1923, the legalist movement united with the [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists|Socialist-Revolutionary-Maximalist]] groups and the Socialist-Revolutionary \"People's\" group in the [[Narodniks|Association of Left Narodism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The leaders who survived this stage, either in prison or in internal exile, fell victims to the [[Great Purge]] in the late 1930s (Algasov, Kamkov and Karelin were shot in 1938, while Spiridonova was executed in 1941). <ref name=\u201dKowalski11\u201d>{{cite journal| last = Kowalski| first = R.| title = \u2018Fellow travelers\u2019 or revolutionary dreamers?

In their opinion, industrial enterprises should be transferred to the self-government of labor collectives, united in a common federation of manufacturers. Consumption had to be organized through a [[cooperative federation|union of cooperatives]] - local self-governing [[consumer cooperatives|consumer societies]], united in a common federation. Economic life should be organized by the joint arrangements of these two associations, for which it was necessary to create special economic councils, elected from production and consumer organizations. Political and military power should have been concentrated in the hands of political councils elected by the working people on a territorial basis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Ukrainian Left Socialist Revolutionaries (led by [[Yakov Brown]]) believed that along with economic and political councils, councils on ethnic issues should elected by representatives of various ethnic communities of workers - [[Jews]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Greeks]], etc., which, in their opinion, would be especially relevant for multinational Ukraine. Each person received the right to freely \"enroll\" in any community of their choice - ethnicity was considered by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to be a matter of free self-determination of a person, the result of his personal choice, and not a question of blood. The ethnic councils of workers, forming, as it were, the third chamber of power of councils, were to deal with the development of culture, schools, institutions, educational systems in local languages, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]\n* [[Russian Revolution]]/[[Russian Civil War]]\n* [[Left SR Uprising]]\n* [[Tambov Rebellion]]\n* [[Green armies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Russian Revolution 1917}}\n[[Category:1917 establishments in Russia]]\n[[Category:Defunct socialist parties in Russia]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1917]]\n[[Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution]]\n[[Category:Socialist Revolutionary Party]]\n[[Category:Soviet opposition groups]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref name fixedWP:REFNAME", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries"}

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1897 by E. Taylor of [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1458>{{cite NSW SHR|5051357|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks|hr=01458|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in expanding and improving the New South Wales road network. Before the bridges were built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high-priced wool clip of the time could carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed before the truss bridge's construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited use of iron and steel, which had to be imported from England,<ref name=nswshr-1458/> until the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] opened in the early 20th century.\n\n[[Allan truss]]es were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nOpened in October 1897 and built by Messrs. Taylor and Murphy of Balmain, the bridge is maintained by the [[Roads and Maritime Services]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan truss bridges|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/timber-tuss-strat-approach-appendix-1c.pdf|publisher=[[Roads and Maritime Services]]|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge is an Allan-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are two approach spans at one end and one at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|300|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The timber truss spans are supported by painted twin cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The approach spans are supported by timber trestles. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|15|ft|m|0}}. A post and rail timber guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be intact and in good condition as at 22 October 1998. The structure is currently carrying more load than it is designed for and, as it is not unique, if it had to be rebuilt it would not be retained. Its design is seen elsewhere as are the iron cylinders supporting it.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4300155|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1897, the Wallaby Rocks Bridge is amongst the oldest examples of an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The bridge has iron piers, which is a rare technical and aesthetic feature, and has the ability to demonstrate much about the manufacturing technology of the late 19th century. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Turon River bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive, and the large three main span construction is an imposing presence. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Turon River Bridge is held in some esteem by the people of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and contributes in a small way to the heritage tourism which is popular in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n*[[:Category:Allan truss bridges|List of Allan truss bridges]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nOpened in October 1897 and built by Messrs. Taylor and Murphy of Balmain, the bridge is maintained by the [[Roads and Maritime Services]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan truss bridges|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/timber-tuss-strat-approach-appendix-1c.pdf|publisher=[[Roads and Maritime Services]]|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge is an Allan-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are two approach spans at one end and one at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|300|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The timber truss spans are supported by painted twin cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The approach spans are supported by timber trestles. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|15|ft|m|0}}. A post and rail timber guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be intact and in good condition as at 22 October 1998. The structure is currently carrying more load than it is designed for and, as it is not unique, if it had to be rebuilt it would not be retained. Its design is seen elsewhere as are the iron cylinders supporting it.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4300155|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1897, the Wallaby Rocks Bridge is amongst the oldest examples of an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The bridge has iron piers, which is a rare technical and aesthetic feature, and has the ability to demonstrate much about the manufacturing technology of the late 19th century. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Turon River bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive, and the large three main span construction is an imposing presence. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Turon River Bridge is held in some esteem by the people of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and contributes in a small way to the heritage tourism which is popular in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n*[[:Category:Allan truss bridges|List of Allan truss bridges]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

{"title_page": "System of polynomial equations", "text_new": "A '''system of polynomial equations''' (sometimes simply a '''polynomial system''') is a set of [[simultaneous equations]] {{math|1=''f''<sub>1</sub> = 0, ..., ''f''<sub>''h''</sub> = 0}} where the {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are [[polynomial]]s in several variables, say {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, over some [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|''k''}}. \n\nA ''solution'' of a polynomial system is a set of values for the {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}s which belong to some [[algebraically closed]] [[field extension]] {{math|''K''}} of {{math|''k''}}, and make all equations true. When {{math|''k''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s, {{math|''K''}} is generally assumed to be the field of [[complex number]]s, because each solution belongs to a [[field extension]] of {{math|''k''}}, which is isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers.\n\nThis article is about the methods for solving, that is, finding all solutions or describing them. As these methods are designed for being implemented in a computer, emphasis is given on fields {{math|''k''}} in which computation (including equality testing) is easy and efficient, that is the field of [[rational number]]s and [[finite field]]s.\n\nSearching for solutions that belong to a specific set is a problem which is generally much more difficult, and is outside the scope of this article, except for the case of the solutions in a given finite field. For the case of solutions of which all components are integers or rational numbers, see [[Diophantine equation]].\n\n==Examples and extensions==\n===Trigonometric equations===\nA trigonometric equation is an equation {{math|1=''g'' = 0}} where {{math|''g''}} is a [[trigonometric polynomial]]. Such an equation may be converted into a polynomial system by expanding the sines and cosines in it (using [[trigonometric functions#Sum and difference formulas|sum and difference formulas]]), replacing {{math|sin(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'')}} by two new variables {{math|''s''}} and {{math|''c''}} and adding the new equation {{math|1=''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 1 = 0}}.\n\nFor example, because of the identity\n:<math>\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^3(x)-3\\cos(x),</math>\nsolving the equation\n:<math> \\sin^3(x)+\\cos(3x)=0 </math>\nis equivalent to solving the polynomial system\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\ns^3+4c^3-3c&=0\\\\\ns^2+c^2-1&=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFor each solution {{math|(''c''{{sub|0}}, ''s''{{sub|0}})}} of this system, there is a unique solution {{mvar|x}} of the equation such that {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' < 2{{pi}}}}.\n\nIn the case of this simple example, it may be unclear whether the system is, or not, easier to solve than the equation. On more complicated examples, one lacks systematics methods for solving directly the equation, while software are available for automatically solving the corresponding system.\n\n=== Solutions in a finite field ===\nWhen solving a system over a finite field {{math|''k''}} with {{math|''q''}} elements, one is primarily interested in the solutions in {{math|''k''}}. As the elements of {{math|''k''}} are exactly the solutions of the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>''q''</sup> \u2013 ''x'' = 0}}, it suffices, for restricting the solutions to {{math|''k''}}, to add the equation {{math|1=''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''q''</sup> \u2013 ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0}} for each variable&nbsp;{{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.\n\n=== Coefficients in a number field or in a finite field with non-prime order ===\n\nThe elements of a [[number field]] are usually represented as polynomials in a generator of the field which satisfies some univariate polynomial equation. To work with a polynomial system whose coefficients belong to a number field, it suffices to consider this generator as a new variable and to add the equation of the generator to the equations of the system. Thus solving a polynomial system over a number field is reduced to solving another system over the rational numbers.\n\nFor example, if a system contains <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, a system over the rational numbers is obtained by adding the equation {{math|1=''r''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> \u2013 2 = 0}} and replacing <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> by {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} in the other equations.\n\nIn the case of a finite field, the same transformation allows always to suppose that the field {{math|''k''}} has a prime order.\n\n==Basic properties and definitions==\nA system is [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] if the number of equations is higher than the number of variables. A system is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]] if it has no solutions. By [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] this means that 1 is a [[linear combination]] (with polynomials as coefficients) of the first members of the equations. Most but not all overdetermined systems, when constructed with random coefficients, are inconsistent. For example, the system {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2013 1 = 0, ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 1 = 0}} is overdetermined (having two equations but only one unknown), but it is not inconsistent since it has the solution {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}.\n\nA system is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] if the number of equations is lower than the number of the variables. An underdetermined system is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions in an algebraically closed extension {{math|''K''}} of&nbsp;{{math|''k''}}.\n\nA system is [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] if it has a finite number of solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&nbsp;''k''. This terminology comes from the fact that the [[algebraic variety]] of the solutions has [[Dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] zero. A system with infinitely many solutions is said to be ''positive-dimensional''.\n\nA zero-dimensional system with as many equations as variables is sometimes said to be ''well-behaved''.<ref>Songxin Liang, J. Gerhard, D.J. Jeffrey, G. Moroz, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Stoutemyer/publication/235941679_Unit_normalization_of_multinomials_over_Gaussian_integers/links/02e7e532ddec858b2a000000.pdf#page=2 A Package for Solving Parametric Polynomial Systems]''. Communications in Computer Algebra (2009)</ref>\n[[B\u00e9zout's theorem]] asserts that a well-behaved system whose equations have degrees {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} has at most {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} solutions. This bound is sharp. If all the degrees are equal to {{math|''d''}}, this bound becomes {{math|''d''<sup>''n''</sup>}} and is exponential in the number of variables. (The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] is the special case {{math|1= ''n'' = 1}}.)\n\nThis exponential behavior makes solving polynomial systems difficult and explains why there are few solvers that are able to automatically solve systems with B\u00e9zout's bound higher than, say, 25 (three equations of degree 3 or five equations of degree 2 are beyond this bound).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== What is solving? ==\nThe first thing to do in solving a polynomial system is to decide if it is inconsistent, zero-dimensional or positive dimensional. This may be done by the computation of a [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] of the left-hand sides of the equations. The system is ''inconsistent'' if this Gr\u00f6bner basis is reduced to 1. The system is ''zero-dimensional'' if, for every variable there is a [[Gr\u00f6bner basis|leading monomial]] of some element of the Gr\u00f6bner basis which is a pure power of this variable. For this test, the best [[monomial order]] is usually the [[monomial order#Graded reverse lexicographic order|graded reverse lexicographic]] one (grevlex).\n\nIf the system is ''positive-dimensional'', it has infinitely many solutions. It is thus not possible to enumerate them. It follows that, in this case, solving may only mean \"finding a description of the solutions from which the relevant properties of the solutions are easy to extract\". There is no commonly accepted such description. In fact there are many different \"relevant properties\", which involve almost every subfield of [[algebraic geometry]].\n\nA natural example of such a question positive-dimensional systems is the following: ''decide if a polynomial system over the [[rational number]]s has a finite number of real solutions and compute them''. A generalization of this question is ''find at least one solution in each [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of the set of real solutions of a polynomial system''.  The classical algorithm for solving these question is [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which has a [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] [[computational complexity]] and therefore cannot be used in practice, except for very small examples.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, solving consists of computing all the solutions. There are two different ways of outputting the solutions. The most common, possible for real or complex solutions, consists of outputting numeric approximations of the solutions. Such a solution is called ''numeric''. A solution is ''certified'' if it is provided with a bound on the error of the approximations which separates the different solutions.\n\nThe other way to represent the solutions is said to be ''algebraic''. It uses the fact that, for a zero-dimensional system, the solutions belong to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field ''k'' of the coefficients of the system. There are several ways to represent the solution in an algebraic closure, which are discussed below. All of them allow one to compute a numerical approximation of the solutions by solving one or several univariate equations. For this computation, the representation involving the solving of only one univariate polynomial for each solution is preferable: computing the roots of a polynomial which has approximate coefficients is a highly unstable problem.\n\n== Algebraic representation of the solutions==\n=== Regular chains ===\n{{main|Regular chain}}\nThe usual way of representing the solutions is through zero-dimensional regular chains. Such a chain consists of a sequence of polynomials {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}}, {{math|''f''<sub>2</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that, for every {{math|''i''}} such that {{math|1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}}\n* {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} only, which has a degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0}} in {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}};\n* the coefficient of {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''d''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}} in {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i'' \u22121 </sub>}} which does not have any common zero with {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''i'' \u2212 1</sub>}}.\n\nTo such a [[regular chain]] is associated a ''triangular system of equations''\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(x_1)= 0\\\\\nf_2(x_1,x_2)=0\\\\\n\\quad\\vdots\\\\\nf_n(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe solutions of this system are obtained by solving the first univariate equation, substituting the solutions in the other equations, then solving the second equation which is now univariate, and so on. The definition of regular chains implies that the univariate equation obtained from {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} has degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and thus that the system has {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub> ... ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} solutions, provided that there is no multiple root in this resolution process ([[fundamental theorem of algebra]]).\n\nEvery zero-dimensional system of polynomial equations is equivalent (i.e. has the same solutions) to a finite number of regular chains. Several regular chains may be needed, as it is the case for the following system which has three solutions.\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2-1=0\\\\\n(x-1)(y-1)=0\\\\\ny^2-1=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThere are several algorithms for computing a [[triangular decomposition]] of an arbitrary polynomial system (not necessarily zero-dimensional)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aubry | first1 = P. | last2 = Maza | first2 = M.

It consists in computing first the [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] for the [[monomial order|graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex)]], then deducing the lexicographical Gr\u00f6bner basis by FGLM algorithm<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Faug\u00e8re | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Gianni | first2 = P. | last3 = Lazard | first3 = D. | last4 = Mora | first4 = T. | title = Efficient Computation of Zero-Dimensional Gr\u00f6bner Basis by Change of Ordering | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 16 | issue = 4| year = 1993 | doi=10.1006/jsco.1993.1051 | pages=329\u2013344}}</ref> and finally applying the Lextriangular algorithm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | title = Solving zero-dimensional algebraic systems | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 13 | issue = 2| year = 1992 | doi=10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80086-7 | pages=117\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nThis representation of the solutions are fully convenient for coefficients in a finite field. However, for rational coefficients, two aspects have to be taken care of:\n* The output may involve huge integers which may make the computation and the use of the result problematic.\n* To deduce the numeric values of the solutions from the output, one has to solve univariate polynomials with approximate coefficients, which is a highly unstable problem.\n\nThe first issue has been solved by Dahan and Schost:<ref>Xavier Dahan and Eric Schost. ''[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/publications/DaSc.ps Sharp Estimates for Triangular Sets]''. Moreover, recent algorithms for decomposing polynomial systems into triangular decompositions produce regular chains with coefficients matching the results of Dahan and Schost.  In proc.

ISSAC'2011, pages 83-90, ACM Press, 2011 and Journal of Symbolic Computation (to appear)</ref>\n\nThe second issue is generally solved by outputting regular chains of a special form, sometimes called ''shape lemma'', for which all {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} but the first one are equal to {{math|1}}. For getting such regular chains, one may have to add a further variable, called ''separating variable'', which is given the index {{math|0}}. The ''rational univariate representation'', described below,  allows computing such a special regular chain, satisfying Dahan\u2013Schost bound, by starting from either a regular chain or a Gr\u00f6bner basis.\n\n===Rational univariate representation===\nThe ''rational univariate representation'' or RUR is a representation of the solutions of a zero-dimensional polynomial system over the rational numbers which has been introduced by  F. Rouillier.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| first=Fabrice\n| last=Rouillier\n| title=Solving Zero-Dimensional Systems Through the Rational Univariate Representation\n|journal=Appl. Algebra Eng. Commun.

In particular {{math|''h''}} and the {{math|''g''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are defined independently of any algorithm to compute them.\n* The solutions of the system are in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of {{math|''h''}} and the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of each root of {{math|''h''}} equals the multiplicity of the corresponding solution.\n* The solutions of the system are obtained by substituting the roots of {{math|''h''}} in the other equations.\n* If {{math|''h''}} does not have any multiple root then {{math|''g''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[formal derivative|derivative]] of {{math|''h''}}.\n\nFor example, for the system in the previous section, every linear combination of the variable, except the multiples of {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}, is a separating variable. If one chooses {{math|1=''t'' = {{sfrac|''x'' \u2013 ''y''|2}}}} as a separating variable, then the RUR is\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nt^3-t=0\\\\\nx=\\frac{t^2+2t-1}{3t^2-1}\\\\\ny=\\frac{t^2-2t-1}{3t^2-1}.\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe RUR is uniquely defined for a given separating variable, independently of any algorithm, and it preserves the multiplicities of the roots. This is a notable difference with triangular decompositions (even the equiprojectable decomposition), which, in general, do not preserve multiplicities. The RUR shares with equiprojectable decomposition the property of producing an output with coefficients of relatively small size.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, the RUR allows retrieval of the numeric values of the solutions by solving a single univariate polynomial and substituting them in rational functions. This allows production of certified approximations of the solutions to any given precision.\n\nMoreover, the univariate polynomial {{math|''h''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} of the RUR may be factorized, and this gives a RUR for every irreducible factor. This provides the ''prime decomposition'' of the given ideal (that is the [[primary decomposition]] of the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal). In practice, this provides an output with much smaller coefficients, especially in the case of systems with high multiplicities.\n\nContrarily to triangular decompositions and equiprojectable decompositions, the RUR is not defined in positive dimension.\n\n==Algorithms for numerically solving==\n===General solving algorithms===\nThe general numerical algorithms which are designed for any [[system of nonlinear equations]] work also for polynomial systems. However the specific methods will generally be preferred, as the general methods generally do not allow one to find ''all'' solutions. In particular, when a general method does not find any solution, this is usually not an indication that there is no solution.\n\nNevertheless, two methods deserve to be mentioned here.\n\n*[[Newton's method]] may be used if the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. It does not allow one to find all the solutions nor to prove that there is no solution. But it is very fast when starting from a point which is close to a solution. Therefore, it is a basic tool for the homotopy continuation method described below.\n*[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] is rarely used for solving polynomial systems, but it succeeded, around 1970, in showing that a system of 81 quadratic equations in 56 variables is not inconsistent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = Daniel | year = 2009| title = Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? | journal = J. Symb. Comput. | volume = 44 | issue = 3| page = 2009 | doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004}}</ref> With the other known methods this remains beyond the possibilities of modern technology. This method consists simply in minimizing the sum of the squares of the equations. If zero is found as a local minimum, then it is attained at a solution. This method works for overdetermined systems, but outputs an empty information if all local minimums which are found are positive.\n\n=== Homotopy continuation method ===\n{{main|Homotopy continuation}}\nThis is a semi-numeric method which supposes that the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. This method is relatively old but it has been dramatically improved in the last decades.<ref name=\"Vers99\">{{cite journal\n| first=Jan | last=Verschelde\n| title=Algorithm 795: PHCpack: A general-purpose solver for polynomial systems by homotopy continuation\n| journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software\n| volume=25\n| issue=2\n| pages=251\u2013276\n| year=1999\n| url=http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/csums/papers/homotopy/verschelde.pdf\n| doi=10.1145/317275.317286\n}}</ref>\n\nThis method divides into three steps. First an upper bound on the number of solutions is computed. This bound has to be as sharp as possible. Therefore, it is computed by, at least, four different methods and the best value, say <math>N</math>, is kept.\n\nIn the second step, a system <math>g_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, g_n=0</math> of polynomial equations is generated which has exactly <math>N</math> solutions that are easy to compute. This new system has the same number <math>n</math> of variables and the same number <math>n</math> of equations and the same general structure as the system to solve, <math>f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, f_n=0</math>.\n\nThen a [[homotopy]] between the two systems is considered. It consists, for example, of the straight line between the two systems, but other paths may be considered, in particular to avoid some singularities, in the system\n\n:<math>(1-t)g_1+t f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, (1-t)g_n+t f_n=0</math>.\n\nThe homotopy continuation consists in deforming the parameter <math>t</math> from 0 to 1 and ''following'' the <math>N</math> solutions during this deformation. This gives the desired solutions for <math>t = 1</math>. ''Following'' means that, if <math>t_1<t_2</math>, the solutions for <math>t=t_2</math> are deduced from the solutions for <math>t=t_1</math> by Newton's method. The difficulty here is to well choose the value of <math>t_2-t_1:</math> Too large, Newton's convergence may be slow and may even jump from a solution path to another one. Too small, and the number of steps slows down the method.\n\n===Numerically solving from the rational univariate representation===\n\nTo deduce the numeric values of the solutions from a RUR seems easy: it suffices to compute the roots of the univariate polynomial and to substitute them in the other equations. This is not so easy because the evaluation of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial is highly unstable.\n\nThe roots of the univariate polynomial have thus to be computed at a high precision which may not be defined once for all. There are two algorithms which fulfill this requirement.\n\n* [[Aberth method]], implemented in [[MPSolve]] computes all the complex roots to any precision.\n* Uspensky's algorithm of Collins and Akritas,<ref>George E.

This algorithms computes the real roots, isolated in intervals of arbitrary small width. It is implemented in [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (functions ''fsolve'' and ''RootFinding[Isolate]'').\n\n==Software packages==\nThere are at least four software packages which can solve zero-dimensional systems automatically (by automatically, one means that no human intervention is needed between input and output, and thus that no knowledge of the method by the user is needed). There are also several other software packages which may be useful for solving zero-dimensional systems. Some of them are listed after the automatic solvers.\n\nThe [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''RootFinding[Isolate]'' takes as input any polynomial system over the rational numbers (if some coefficients are [[floating point]] numbers, they are converted to rational numbers) and outputs the real solutions represented either (optionally) as intervals of rational numbers or as floating point approximations of arbitrary precision. If the system is not zero dimensional, this is signaled as an error.\n\nInternally, this solver, designed by F. Rouillier computes first a Gr\u00f6bner basis and then a Rational Univariate Representation from which the required approximation of the solutions are deduced. It works routinely for systems having up to a few hundred complex solutions.\n\nThe rational univariate representation may be computed with [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''Groebner[RationalUnivariateRepresentation]''.\n\nTo extract all the complex solutions from a rational univariate representation, one may use [[MPSolve]], which computes the complex roots of univariate polynomials to any precision. It is recommended to run [[MPSolve]] several times, doubling the precision each time, until solutions remain stable, as the substitution of the roots in the equations of the input variables can be highly unstable.\n\nThe second solver is PHCpack,<ref name=\"Vers99\" /><ref>[http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html Release 2.3.86 of PHCpack]</ref> written under the direction of J. Verschelde. PHCpack implements the homotopy continuation method. This solver computes the isolated complex solutions of polynomial systems having as many equations as variables.\n\nThe third solver is Bertini,<ref>Bates, D. J., Hauenstein, J. D., Sommese, A. J., & Wampler, C. W. (2013). Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini (Vol. 25). SIAM.</ref><ref>[http://bertini.nd.edu/ Bertini: Software for Numerical Algebraic Geometry]</ref> written by D. J. Bates, J. D. Hauenstein, A. J. Sommese, and C. W. Wampler. Bertini uses numerical homotopy continuation with adaptive precision.  In addition to computing zero-dimensional solution sets, both PHCpack and Bertini are capable of working with positive dimensional solution sets.\n\nThe fourth solver is the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] library ''RegularChains'', written by Marc Moreno-Maza and collaborators. It contains various functions for solving polynomial systems by means of [[regular chain]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Triangular decomposition]]\n*[[Wu's method of characteristic set]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cox|first=David|author2=John Little |author3=Donal O'Shea  |title=Ideals, varieties, and algorithms : an introduction to computational algebraic geometry and commutative algebra|year=1997|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387946801|edition=2nd}}\n*{{cite book|last=Sturmfels|first=Bernd|title=Solving systems of polynomial equations|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|location=Providence, RI|isbn=0821832514}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Systems Of Polynomial Equations}}\n[[Category:Equations]]\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]\n", "text_old": "A '''system of polynomial equations''' (sometimes simply a '''polynomial system''') is a set of [[simultaneous equations]] {{math|1=''f''<sub>1</sub> = 0, ..., ''f''<sub>''h''</sub> = 0}} where the {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are [[polynomial]]s in several variables, say {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, over some [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|''k''}}. \n\nA ''solution'' of a polynomial system is a set of values for the {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}s which belong to some [[algebraically closed]] [[field extension]] {{math|''K''}} of {{math|''k''}}, and make all equations true. When {{math|''k''}} is the field of [[rational number]]s, {{math|''K''}} is generally assumed to be the field of [[complex number]]s, because each solution belongs to a [[field extension]] of {{math|''k''}}, which is isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers.\n\nThis article is about the methods for solving, that is, finding all solutions or describing them. As these methods are designed for being implemented in a computer, emphasis is given on fields {{math|''k''}} in which computation (including equality testing) is easy and efficient, that is the field of [[rational number]]s and [[finite field]]s.\n\nSearching for solutions that belong to a specific set is a problem which is generally much more difficult, and is outside the scope of this article, except for the case of the solutions in a given finite field. For the case of solutions of which all components are integers or rational numbers, see [[Diophantine equation]].\n\n==Examples and extensions==\n===Trigonometric equations===\nA trigonometric equation is an equation {{math|1=''g'' = 0}} where {{math|''g''}} is a [[trigonometric polynomial]]. Such an equation may be converted into a polynomial system by expanding the sines and cosines in it (using [[trigonometric functions#Sum and difference formulas|sum and difference formulas]]), replacing {{math|sin(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'')}} by two new variables {{math|''s''}} and {{math|''c''}} and adding the new equation {{math|1=''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 1 = 0}}.\n\nFor example, because of the identity\n:<math>\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^3(x)-3\\cos(x),</math>\nsolving the equation\n:<math> \\sin^3(x)+\\cos(3x)=0 </math>\nis equivalent to solving the polynomial system\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\ns^3+4c^3-3c&=0\\\\\ns^2+c^2-1&=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFor each solution {{math|(''c''{{sub|0}}, ''s''{{sub|0}})}} of this system, there is a unique solution {{mvar|x}} of the equation such that {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' < 2{{pi}}}}.\n\nIn the case of this simple example, it may be unclear whether the system is, or not, easier to solve than the equation. On more complicated examples, one lacks systematics methods for solving directly the equation, while software are available for automatically solving the corresponding system.\n\n=== Solutions in a finite field ===\nWhen solving a system over a finite field {{math|''k''}} with {{math|''q''}} elements, one is primarily interested in the solutions in {{math|''k''}}. As the elements of {{math|''k''}} are exactly the solutions of the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>''q''</sup> \u2013 ''x'' = 0}}, it suffices, for restricting the solutions to {{math|''k''}}, to add the equation {{math|1=''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''q''</sup> \u2013 ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0}} for each variable&nbsp;{{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.\n\n=== Coefficients in a number field or in a finite field with non-prime order ===\n\nThe elements of a [[number field]] are usually represented as polynomials in a generator of the field which satisfies some univariate polynomial equation. To work with a polynomial system whose coefficients belong to a number field, it suffices to consider this generator as a new variable and to add the equation of the generator to the equations of the system. Thus solving a polynomial system over a number field is reduced to solving another system over the rational numbers.\n\nFor example, if a system contains <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, a system over the rational numbers is obtained by adding the equation {{math|1=''r''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> \u2013 2 = 0}} and replacing <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> by {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} in the other equations.\n\nIn the case of a finite field, the same transformation allows always to suppose that the field {{math|''k''}} has a prime order.\n\n==Basic properties and definitions==\nA system is [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] if the number of equations is higher than the number of variables. A system is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]] if it has no solutions. By [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] this means that 1 is a [[linear combination]] (with polynomials as coefficients) of the first members of the equations. Most but not all overdetermined systems, when constructed with random coefficients, are inconsistent. For example, the system {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2013 1 = 0, ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 1 = 0}} is overdetermined (having two equations but only one unknown), but it is not inconsistent since it has the solution {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}.\n\nA system is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] if the number of equations is lower than the number of the variables. An underdetermined system is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions in an algebraically closed extension {{math|''K''}} of&nbsp;{{math|''k''}}.\n\nA system is [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] if it has a finite number of solutions in an algebraically closed extension ''K'' of&nbsp;''k''. This terminology comes from the fact that the [[algebraic variety]] of the solutions has [[Dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] zero. A system with infinitely many solutions is said to be ''positive-dimensional''.\n\nA zero-dimensional system with as many equations as variables is sometimes said to be ''well-behaved''.<ref>Songxin Liang, J. Gerhard, D.J. Jeffrey, G. Moroz, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Stoutemyer/publication/235941679_Unit_normalization_of_multinomials_over_Gaussian_integers/links/02e7e532ddec858b2a000000.pdf#page=2 A Package for Solving Parametric Polynomial Systems]''. Communications in Computer Algebra (2009)</ref>\n[[B\u00e9zout's theorem]] asserts that a well-behaved system whose equations have degrees {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} has at most {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} solutions. This bound is sharp. If all the degrees are equal to {{math|''d''}}, this bound becomes {{math|''d''<sup>''n''</sup>}} and is exponential in the number of variables. (The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] is the special case {{math|1= ''n'' = 1}}.)\n\nThis exponential behavior makes solving polynomial systems difficult and explains why there are few solvers that are able to automatically solve systems with B\u00e9zout's bound higher than, say, 25 (three equations of degree 3 or five equations of degree 2 are beyond this bound).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== What is solving? ==\nThe first thing to do in solving a polynomial system is to decide if it is inconsistent, zero-dimensional or positive dimensional. This may be done by the computation of a [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] of the left-hand sides of the equations. The system is ''inconsistent'' if this Gr\u00f6bner basis is reduced to 1. The system is ''zero-dimensional'' if, for every variable there is a [[Gr\u00f6bner basis|leading monomial]] of some element of the Gr\u00f6bner basis which is a pure power of this variable. For this test, the best [[monomial order]] is usually the [[monomial order#Graded reverse lexicographic order|graded reverse lexicographic]] one (grevlex).\n\nIf the system is ''positive-dimensional'', it has infinitely many solutions. It is thus not possible to enumerate them. It follows that, in this case, solving may only mean \"finding a description of the solutions from which the relevant properties of the solutions are easy to extract\". There is no commonly accepted such description. In fact there are many different \"relevant properties\", which involve almost every subfield of [[algebraic geometry]].\n\nA natural example of such a question positive-dimensional systems is the following: ''decide if a polynomial system over the [[rational number]]s has a finite number of real solutions and compute them''. A generalization of this question is ''find at least one solution in each [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of the set of real solutions of a polynomial system''.  The classical algorithm for solving these question is [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which has a [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] [[computational complexity]] and therefore cannot be used in practice, except for very small examples.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, solving consists of computing all the solutions. There are two different ways of outputting the solutions. The most common, possible for real or complex solutions, consists of outputting numeric approximations of the solutions. Such a solution is called ''numeric''. A solution is ''certified'' if it is provided with a bound on the error of the approximations which separates the different solutions.\n\nThe other way to represent the solutions is said to be ''algebraic''. It uses the fact that, for a zero-dimensional system, the solutions belong to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field ''k'' of the coefficients of the system. There are several ways to represent the solution in an algebraic closure, which are discussed below. All of them allow one to compute a numerical approximation of the solutions by solving one or several univariate equations. For this computation, the representation involving the solving of only one univariate polynomial for each solution is preferable: computing the roots of a polynomial which has approximate coefficients is a highly unstable problem.\n\n== Algebraic representation of the solutions==\n=== Regular chains ===\n{{main|Regular chain}}\nThe usual way of representing the solutions is through zero-dimensional regular chains. Such a chain consists of a sequence of polynomials {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}}, {{math|''f''<sub>2</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} such that, for every {{math|''i''}} such that {{math|1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}}\n* {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} only, which has a degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0}} in {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}};\n* the coefficient of {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''d''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}} in {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a polynomial in {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''i'' \u22121 </sub>}} which does not have any common zero with {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{math|''f''<sub>''i'' \u2212 1</sub>}}.\n\nTo such a [[regular chain]] is associated a ''triangular system of equations''\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(x_1)= 0\\\\\nf_2(x_1,x_2)=0\\\\\n\\quad\\vdots\\\\\nf_n(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe solutions of this system are obtained by solving the first univariate equation, substituting the solutions in the other equations, then solving the second equation which is now univariate, and so on. The definition of regular chains implies that the univariate equation obtained from {{math|''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}} has degree {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and thus that the system has {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub> ... ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>}} solutions, provided that there is no multiple root in this resolution process ([[fundamental theorem of algebra]]).\n\nEvery zero-dimensional system of polynomial equations is equivalent (i.e. has the same solutions) to a finite number of regular chains. Several regular chains may be needed, as it is the case for the following system which has three solutions.\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2-1=0\\\\\n(x-1)(y-1)=0\\\\\ny^2-1=0.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThere are several algorithms for computing a [[triangular decomposition]] of an arbitrary polynomial system (not necessarily zero-dimensional)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aubry | first1 = P. | last2 = Maza | first2 = M.

It consists in computing first the [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] for the [[monomial order|graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex)]], then deducing the lexicographical Gr\u00f6bner basis by FGLM algorithm<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Faug\u00e8re | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Gianni | first2 = P. | last3 = Lazard | first3 = D. | last4 = Mora | first4 = T. | title = Efficient Computation of Zero-Dimensional Gr\u00f6bner Basis by Change of Ordering | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 16 | issue = 4| year = 1993 | doi=10.1006/jsco.1993.1051 | pages=329\u2013344}}</ref> and finally applying the Lextriangular algorithm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | title = Solving zero-dimensional algebraic systems | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 13 | issue = 2| year = 1992 | doi=10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80086-7 | pages=117\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nThis representation of the solutions are fully convenient for coefficients in a finite field. However, for rational coefficients, two aspects have to be taken care of:\n* The output may involve huge integers which may make the computation and the use of the result problematic.\n* To deduce the numeric values of the solutions from the output, one has to solve univariate polynomials with approximate coefficients, which is a highly unstable problem.\n\nThe first issue has been solved by Dahan and Schost:<ref>Xavier Dahan and Eric Schost.

For getting such regular chains, one may have to add a further variable, called ''separating variable'', which is given the index {{math|0}}. The ''rational univariate representation'', described below,  allows computing such a special regular chain, satisfying Dahan\u2013Schost bound, by starting from either a regular chain or a Gr\u00f6bner basis.\n\n===Rational univariate representation===\nThe ''rational univariate representation'' or RUR is a representation of the solutions of a zero-dimensional polynomial system over the rational numbers which has been introduced by  F. Rouillier.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| first=Fabrice\n| last=Rouillier\n| title=Solving Zero-Dimensional Systems Through the Rational Univariate Representation\n|journal=Appl. Algebra Eng. Commun.

In particular {{math|''h''}} and the {{math|''g''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are defined independently of any algorithm to compute them.\n* The solutions of the system are in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of {{math|''h''}} and the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of each root of {{math|''h''}} equals the multiplicity of the corresponding solution.\n* The solutions of the system are obtained by substituting the roots of {{math|''h''}} in the other equations.\n* If {{math|''h''}} does not have any multiple root then {{math|''g''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[formal derivative|derivative]] of {{math|''h''}}.\n\nFor example, for the system in the previous section, every linear combination of the variable, except the multiples of {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x'' + ''y''}}, is a separating variable. If one chooses {{math|1=''t'' = {{sfrac|''x'' \u2013 ''y''|2}}}} as a separating variable, then the RUR is\n:<math>\n\\begin{cases}\nt^3-t=0\\\\\nx=\\frac{t^2+2t-1}{3t^2-1}\\\\\ny=\\frac{t^2-2t-1}{3t^2-1}.\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe RUR is uniquely defined for a given separating variable, independently of any algorithm, and it preserves the multiplicities of the roots. This is a notable difference with triangular decompositions (even the equiprojectable decomposition), which, in general, do not preserve multiplicities. The RUR shares with equiprojectable decomposition the property of producing an output with coefficients of relatively small size.\n\nFor zero-dimensional systems, the RUR allows retrieval of the numeric values of the solutions by solving a single univariate polynomial and substituting them in rational functions. This allows production of certified approximations of the solutions to any given precision.\n\nMoreover, the univariate polynomial {{math|''h''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} of the RUR may be factorized, and this gives a RUR for every irreducible factor. This provides the ''prime decomposition'' of the given ideal (that is the [[primary decomposition]] of the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal). In practice, this provides an output with much smaller coefficients, especially in the case of systems with high multiplicities.\n\nContrarily to triangular decompositions and equiprojectable decompositions, the RUR is not defined in positive dimension.\n\n==Algorithms for numerically solving==\n===General solving algorithms===\nThe general numerical algorithms which are designed for any [[system of nonlinear equations]] work also for polynomial systems. However the specific methods will generally be preferred, as the general methods generally do not allow one to find ''all'' solutions. In particular, when a general method does not find any solution, this is usually not an indication that there is no solution.\n\nNevertheless, two methods deserve to be mentioned here.\n\n*[[Newton's method]] may be used if the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. It does not allow one to find all the solutions nor to prove that there is no solution. But it is very fast when starting from a point which is close to a solution. Therefore, it is a basic tool for the homotopy continuation method described below.\n*[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] is rarely used for solving polynomial systems, but it succeeded, around 1970, in showing that a system of 81 quadratic equations in 56 variables is not inconsistent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lazard | first1 = Daniel | year = 2009| title = Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? | journal = J. Symb. Comput. | volume = 44 | issue = 3| page = 2009 | doi=10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004}}</ref> With the other known methods this remains beyond the possibilities of modern technology. This method consists simply in minimizing the sum of the squares of the equations. If zero is found as a local minimum, then it is attained at a solution. This method works for overdetermined systems, but outputs an empty information if all local minimums which are found are positive.\n\n=== Homotopy continuation method ===\n{{main|Homotopy continuation}}\nThis is a semi-numeric method which supposes that the number of equations is equal to the number of variables. This method is relatively old but it has been dramatically improved in the last decades.<ref name=\"Vers99\">{{cite journal\n| first=Jan | last=Verschelde\n| title=Algorithm 795: PHCpack: A general-purpose solver for polynomial systems by homotopy continuation\n| journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software\n| volume=25\n| issue=2\n| pages=251\u2013276\n| year=1999\n| url=http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/csums/papers/homotopy/verschelde.pdf\n| doi=10.1145/317275.317286\n}}</ref>\n\nThis method divides into three steps. First an upper bound on the number of solutions is computed. This bound has to be as sharp as possible. Therefore, it is computed by, at least, four different methods and the best value, say <math>N</math>, is kept.\n\nIn the second step, a system <math>g_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, g_n=0</math> of polynomial equations is generated which has exactly <math>N</math> solutions that are easy to compute. This new system has the same number <math>n</math> of variables and the same number <math>n</math> of equations and the same general structure as the system to solve, <math>f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, f_n=0</math>.\n\nThen a [[homotopy]] between the two systems is considered. It consists, for example, of the straight line between the two systems, but other paths may be considered, in particular to avoid some singularities, in the system\n\n:<math>(1-t)g_1+t f_1=0,\\, \\ldots,\\, (1-t)g_n+t f_n=0</math>.\n\nThe homotopy continuation consists in deforming the parameter <math>t</math> from 0 to 1 and ''following'' the <math>N</math> solutions during this deformation. This gives the desired solutions for <math>t = 1</math>. ''Following'' means that, if <math>t_1<t_2</math>, the solutions for <math>t=t_2</math> are deduced from the solutions for <math>t=t_1</math> by Newton's method. The difficulty here is to well choose the value of <math>t_2-t_1:</math> Too large, Newton's convergence may be slow and may even jump from a solution path to another one. Too small, and the number of steps slows down the method.\n\n===Numerically solving from the rational univariate representation===\n\nTo deduce the numeric values of the solutions from a RUR seems easy: it suffices to compute the roots of the univariate polynomial and to substitute them in the other equations. This is not so easy because the evaluation of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial is highly unstable.\n\nThe roots of the univariate polynomial have thus to be computed at a high precision which may not be defined once for all. There are two algorithms which fulfill this requirement.\n\n* [[Aberth method]], implemented in [[MPSolve]] computes all the complex roots to any precision.\n* Uspensky's algorithm of Collins and Akritas,<ref>George E. Collins and Alkiviadis G. Akritas, ''[http://www.inf.uth.gr/~akritas/articles/1.pdf Polynomial Real Root Isolation Using Descarte's Rule of Signs]''. Proceedings of the 1976 ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation</ref> improved by Rouillier and Zimmermann <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rouillier | first1 = F. | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = P. | title = Efficient isolation of polynomial's real roots | journal = Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume = 162 | issue = 1| year = 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2003.08.015 | pages=33\u201350| bibcode = 2004JCoAM.162...33R }}</ref> and based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]]. This algorithms computes the real roots, isolated in intervals of arbitrary small width. It is implemented in [[Maple (software)|Maple]] (functions ''fsolve'' and ''RootFinding[Isolate]'').\n\n==Software packages==\nThere are at least four software packages which can solve zero-dimensional systems automatically (by automatically, one means that no human intervention is needed between input and output, and thus that no knowledge of the method by the user is needed). There are also several other software packages which may be useful for solving zero-dimensional systems. Some of them are listed after the automatic solvers.\n\nThe [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''RootFinding[Isolate]'' takes as input any polynomial system over the rational numbers (if some coefficients are [[floating point]] numbers, they are converted to rational numbers) and outputs the real solutions represented either (optionally) as intervals of rational numbers or as floating point approximations of arbitrary precision. If the system is not zero dimensional, this is signaled as an error.\n\nInternally, this solver, designed by F. Rouillier computes first a Gr\u00f6bner basis and then a Rational Univariate Representation from which the required approximation of the solutions are deduced. It works routinely for systems having up to a few hundred complex solutions.\n\nThe rational univariate representation may be computed with [[Maple (software)|Maple]] function ''Groebner[RationalUnivariateRepresentation]''.\n\nTo extract all the complex solutions from a rational univariate representation, one may use [[MPSolve]], which computes the complex roots of univariate polynomials to any precision. It is recommended to run [[MPSolve]] several times, doubling the precision each time, until solutions remain stable, as the substitution of the roots in the equations of the input variables can be highly unstable.\n\nThe second solver is PHCpack,<ref name=\"Vers99\" /><ref>[http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html Release 2.3.86 of PHCpack]</ref> written under the direction of J. Verschelde. PHCpack implements the homotopy continuation method. This solver computes the isolated complex solutions of polynomial systems having as many equations as variables.\n\nThe third solver is Bertini,<ref>Bates, D. J., Hauenstein, J. D., Sommese, A. J., & Wampler, C. W. (2013). Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini (Vol. 25). SIAM.</ref><ref>[http://bertini.nd.edu/ Bertini: Software for Numerical Algebraic Geometry]</ref> written by D. J. Bates, J. D. Hauenstein, A. J. Sommese, and C. W. Wampler. Bertini uses numerical homotopy continuation with adaptive precision.  In addition to computing zero-dimensional solution sets, both PHCpack and Bertini are capable of working with positive dimensional solution sets.\n\nThe fourth solver is the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] library ''RegularChains'', written by Marc Moreno-Maza and collaborators. It contains various functions for solving polynomial systems by means of [[regular chain]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Triangular decomposition]]\n*[[Wu's method of characteristic set]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cox|first=David|author2=John Little |author3=Donal O'Shea  |title=Ideals, varieties, and algorithms : an introduction to computational algebraic geometry and commutative algebra|year=1997|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387946801|edition=2nd}}\n*{{cite book|last=Sturmfels|first=Bernd|title=Solving systems of polynomial equations|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|location=Providence, RI|isbn=0821832514}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Systems Of Polynomial Equations}}\n[[Category:Equations]]\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Polynomials]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations"}
