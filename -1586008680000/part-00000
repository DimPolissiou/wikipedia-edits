Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

''Super Mario Maker 2'' introduces new features and course assets, including a new course style and assets based on ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Mario#Common elements|Super Mario Maker#Gameplay|label 1=Common elements of the Super Mario series|label 2=Gameplay of Super Mario Maker}}\nLike its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players create their own courses using assets from across the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series and publish them onto the internet for others to play. Players can choose from a selection of prior ''Super Mario'' games to base their course's visual style and gameplay on, including ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', and a newly introduced ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' theme. Gameplay mechanics and enemy behaviors can vary between the styles, with some elements being limited to specific styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Announced for Nintendo Switch|last=Marks|first=Tom|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214180013/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|archive-date=February 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nlife\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Confirmed For Switch, Launches This June|last=Craddock|first=Ryan|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|title=Mario Maker 2 Is Heading To Switch|last=Hilliard|first=Kyle|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe sequel adds various assets and tools, including assets and a course theme based on ''Super Mario 3D World''.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

His younger brothers are [[Jomari Yllana]], [[Ryan Yllana]] and Paulie Yllana.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married to actress Jacqui Manzano (born March 31, 1981) with four children: Mikaela, Andee, Jaime and Nathan.\n\nHe is a member of Scouts Royale Brotherhood (SRB) International Service Fraternity and Sorority under the banner of the Alpha Delta Chapter.\n\n==Show business life==\nHe started in show business in 1984 with talent manager the late [[Douglas Quijano]]. He then auditioned for the teen TV variety show ''[[That's Entertainment (TV series)|That's Entertainment]]'' after attempting a career as a professional basketball player.  He started with support roles in both comedy and drama.  He was nominated by different award-giving bodies as Best Supporting Actor in the movie ''Itanong Mo sa Buwan'', starring opposite [[Jaclyn Jose]] and directed by [[Chito S. Ro\u00f1o|Chito Rono]].\n\nHis turning point in show business came in 1991, when he was given the role of Dino Tengco, the mentally disabled son of the crazy politician couple Barbara and Anding Tengco in the ABS-CBN satirical sitcom ''[[Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata]]''.  He was awarded Best Comedy Actor by Star Awards in 1992 for his efforts.  He was subsequently launched as a solo comedian and had several successful comedy films to his name, among them ''Dino, Abangan ang Susunod Na...'' (his launching movie), ''Pempe ni Sara at Pen'' (with [[Kris Aquino]] and [[Vandolph Quizon|Vandolph]]) and ''Milyonaryong Mini'' (with [[John Estrada]] and [[Sheryl Cruz]]).  He also became part of the sitcoms ''[[Ober da Bakod]]'' (GMA Network) and ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'' (ABS-CBN).

Legaspi planned a surprise [[Marriage proposal|proposal]] and [[civil wedding]] with the help of their families and the network. The ceremony was later air the following Saturday as the television special Zoren-Carmina: Always Forever, A Wedding Like No Other. The idea of a surprise proposal followed by a [[flashmob]]-style instant wedding was inspired by a remarkably similar episode of the [[Television in the United States|US television]] programme [[Mobbed]], hosted by [[Howie Mandel]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"PMPC Star Award\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/24774/heart-jennylyn-kim-julia-liza-nadine-dawn-nominated-for-best-drama-actress-at-star-awards-for-tv?ref=latest_feed_1 | title= Heart, Jennylyn, Kim, Julia, Liza, Nadine, Dawn nominated for Best Drama Actress at Star Awards for TV | date= October 8, 2016 | last= Sampayan | first= Anj | work= [[Philippine Entertainment Portal]] | accessdate= October 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kissing Paulo\">{{cite web | url = http://entertainment.inquirer.net/167360/carmina-villarroel-kissing-paulo-avelino-just-part-of-the-job | title = Carmina Villarroel: Kissing Paulo Avelino just part of the job | date= 9 April 2015 | work= [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | accessdate= 2 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"In and Out\">{{cite web | url= http://www.pep.ph/news/40724/charlene-gonzalez-muhlach-toni-gonzaga-out-in-reformatted-the-buzz-janice-de-belen-and-carmina-villarroel-in | title= Charlene Gonzalez-Muhlach, Toni Gonzaga out in reformatted The Buzz;

The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm.\n\nThe trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO, now a tentative trio, pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune.\n\nIn late 1978, APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Paredes stormed out a songwriting session. While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line, he was provided the word \"katapusan\"; a 4 syllable word. The error went unnoticed until post recording where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended.\n\nLooking back, the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners. Their farewell concert, which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights, not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year.\n\n==Achievements==\nIn the three decades since that \"farewell\" concert, the APO has made 22 record albums; hosted several television shows including their own noontime Sunday show \"Sa Linggo nAPO Sila\" and noontime show from Monday to Saturday \"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\"; and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial, dinner, and corporate shows. They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States, in Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos the world over.\n\nIn 1978, APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival (now MetroPop Song Festival in 1996 to 2003) for their runner-up song ''Ewan'', the song was composed by Louie Ocampo.\n\nIn October 1987, during their annual US tour, the APO became the first Filipino pop artists with [[Marco Sison]] to perform at the Main Hall of New York's prestigious [[Carnegie Hall]]. They also performed at the equally prestigious [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, Canada's music capital. Both concerts, as well as the other shows held during that particular concert tour, were sold out. The APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1987, they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc. And in 1994, they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by [[Awit Awards]] - the Filipino equivalent of the [[Grammy]]. They have also been conferred the [[Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award]], the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts.\n\nThe APO also earned international recognition for \"[[Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo]]\" was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986. A few months later, the English version \"A New and Better Way\" was launched in Australia. In February 1987, the first anniversary of the Philippines' People Power revolution, the song was released in London, England. The lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of Our Lady of Edsa Shrine, the center of the revolution.\n\nIn 1998, Legendary OPM group APO and defunct band [[Eraserheads]] teamed up for their first \"San Miguel Beer\" TV commercial \"Homeboys.\" The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rock/alternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled ''[[Kami nAPO Muna]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Kami nAPO Muna Ulit]]'' in 2007.\n\nIn 1999, APO was also a finalist at MetroPop Song Festival for their song finalist ''Dito Sa Kanto'', the song was composed by Noel Cabangon, then Cabangon covered his version in 1999 then re-recorded again a duet with Parokya Ni Edgar vocalist Chito Miranda in 2013.\n\nIn 2007, Jacee with the group was awarded as \"MYX Magna Award 2007\" in the MYX Music Awards 2007 achieving the best of opm pop music and also has an achievements in music and recording in the OPM history.\n\nIn 2009, APO was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk Of Fame, contributing their skills in both singing, hosting and acting.\n\n==APO Tribute Albums==\nJust a few years after their hiatus, the tribute album [[Kami nAPO Muna|Kami nAPO Muna!: The Music Of APO Hiking Society]] was released in honor of the group. The Filipino musical artists who did their own unique renditions of The APO classics includes: [[Imago (band)|Imago]], [[Orange and Lemons]], [[Parokya ni Edgar]], [[Kamikazee]], [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]], [[Sugarfree (band)|Sugarfree]], [[Itchyworms]], [[Sponge Cola]], Boldstar, [[Sound (band)|Sound]], [[Drip (band)|Drip]], [[Rocksteddy]], [[Top Suzara]], [[Barbie Almalbis]], [[Kitchie Nadal]], [[Shamrock]], and [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]]. Their second volume, Kami nAPO muna Ulit has also included their new members in the compilation album are [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], [[Silent Sanctuary]], Concrete Sam, [[Up Dharma Down]], Chilitees, The Bloomfields, Scrambled Eggs, The Spaceflower Show, and [[Hilera]].\n\nAcoustic Balladeer Noel Cabangon also had a new tribute album to the pinoy pop musical group, ''Throwback: Ang Songbook Ng APO'' was launched in 2014 with features with his cover versions of popular various APO songs in his new album released by Universal Records.\n\n==2008-2009 Reunion==\nOn 20 September 2008, Apo Hiking Society had a reunion concert called \"Apo of the Philippines\" which was held at the Araneta Coliseum to celebrate their 39th Anniversary. They sang all of the APO Favorites and all songs from their past releases.\n\nOn February 7, 2009, The Apo performed in the Open Air FTI Complex in Taguig. The free concert was sponsored in cooperation with the Taguig City hall. One month later, the Eraserheads had their Final Set Concert.\n\nOn November 17, 2009, the Apo Hiking Society marked their 40th anniversary with a big concert at the SM North EDSA Skydome.  It was called \"APO Kayang-Kaya Pa\". This was originally scheduled on September 26 but was rescheduled due to the [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon \"Ondoy\" (\"Ketsana\")]].\n\n==2010 Retirement==\nLast December 16, 2009, the APO Hiking Society announced that they are already retiring as a group due to \"diminishing creative process.\" They performed a series of shows that started on February 14, 2010 and ended on May, just in time for the elections.<ref name=\"mb7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/13/10/apo-hiking-society-bidding-adieu-music-industry|title=APO Hiking Society bidding adieu to music industry|author=Reyma Buan-Deveza|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=abs-cbnnews.com}}</ref> They also reunited for the last time to perform in the [[Inauguration of Benigno Aquino III|Inauguration of President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III]] last June 30, 2010.\n\n==Post APO Hiking Society==\nAfter APO retired from singing, its members remained active in show business and are still performing:\n\nJim Paredes is still active in singing and also a photography hobbyist. And also a Liberal Party supporter, who spouts his dismay on the current government.\n\nBuboy Garovillo now has a career acting in both movie and television.\n\nDanny Javier continues to own ''Pidro: Ang Saplot Ng Bayan'' T-shirts and recently starred in ''[[Bangis]]'' on TV5 in 2010 as well as appeared in Season 3 of ''ASOP: A Song Of Praise Music Festival'' in 2014 as a guest judge.  As of 2018, Danny is retired from both singing and acting.\n\n==Film Musical==\nIn 2012, a [[Jukebox musical|movie musical]] based on APO songs was released.  Titled ''[[I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!|I Doo Bidoobidoo]]'', it was released on August 29.  The movie was inspired by ''[[Mamma Mia!|Mamma Mia]]'', a [[Musical theatre|musical]] that was based on and used [[ABBA]] songs, which later became a [[mamma Mia!

The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the [[paralyzed]] Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, [[Apolinario Mabini]], and later shortened to \"Apo\", an [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] term for a wise man or a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term of grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" ([[all caps]]). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology#Potentially active|potentially-active]] [[stratovolcano]] [[Mount Apo]].\n\nAs the students advanced into college, [[Danny Javier]] joined the group.

The puns have been minimally extended into English, as in ('''''APO'''''calyptic). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==History==\nThe Name \"Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society\" was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure, [[Apolinario Mabini]], famously lost the use of his legs to polio.<ref name=\"Ironic Title\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/nightlife/042904_music.html|title=In the Philippines, APO is legendary|last=Gelfand|first=Janelle|date=April 30, 2004|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Apo Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the [[Meralco Theater]]  in [[Pasig City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. Just out of college, the group was the talk of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and adjoining campuses for their music and humor.\n\nIt was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music, however, that the APO, then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, finally had a citywide audience. One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student. The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm.\n\nThe trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO, now a tentative trio, pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune.\n\nIn late 1978, APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Paredes stormed out a songwriting session. While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line, he was provided the word \"katapusan\"; a 4 syllable word. The error went unnoticed until post recording where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended.\n\nLooking back, the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners. Their farewell concert, which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights, not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year.\n\n==Achievements==\nIn the three decades since that \"farewell\" concert, the APO has made 22 record albums; hosted several television shows including their own noontime Sunday show \"Sa Linggo nAPO Sila\" and noontime show from Monday to Saturday \"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\"; and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial, dinner, and corporate shows. They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States, in Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos the world over.\n\nIn 1978, APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival (now MetroPop Song Festival in 1996 to 2003) for their runner-up song ''Ewan'', the song was composed by Louie Ocampo.\n\nIn October 1987, during their annual US tour, the APO became the first Filipino pop artists with [[Marco Sison]] to perform at the Main Hall of New York's prestigious [[Carnegie Hall]]. They also performed at the equally prestigious [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, Canada's music capital. Both concerts, as well as the other shows held during that particular concert tour, were sold out. The APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1987, they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc. And in 1994, they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by [[Awit Awards]] - the Filipino equivalent of the [[Grammy]]. They have also been conferred the [[Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award]], the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts.\n\nThe APO also earned international recognition for \"[[Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo]]\" was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986. A few months later, the English version \"A New and Better Way\" was launched in Australia. In February 1987, the first anniversary of the Philippines' People Power revolution, the song was released in London, England. The lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of Our Lady of Edsa Shrine, the center of the revolution.\n\nIn 1998, Legendary OPM group APO and defunct band [[Eraserheads]] teamed up for their first \"San Miguel Beer\" TV commercial \"Homeboys.\" The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rock/alternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled ''[[Kami nAPO Muna]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Kami nAPO Muna Ulit]]'' in 2007.\n\nIn 1999, APO was also a finalist at MetroPop Song Festival for their song finalist ''Dito Sa Kanto'', the song was composed by Noel Cabangon, then Cabangon covered his version in 1999 then re-recorded again a duet with Parokya Ni Edgar vocalist Chito Miranda in 2013.\n\nIn 2007, Jacee with the group was awarded as \"MYX Magna Award 2007\" in the MYX Music Awards 2007 achieving the best of opm pop music and also has an achievements in music and recording in the OPM history.\n\nIn 2009, APO was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk Of Fame, contributing their skills in both singing, hosting and acting.\n\n==APO Tribute Albums==\nJust a few years after their hiatus, the tribute album [[Kami nAPO Muna|Kami nAPO Muna!: The Music Of APO Hiking Society]] was released in honor of the group. The Filipino musical artists who did their own unique renditions of The APO classics includes: [[Imago (band)|Imago]], [[Orange and Lemons]], [[Parokya ni Edgar]], [[Kamikazee]], [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]], [[Sugarfree (band)|Sugarfree]], [[Itchyworms]], [[Sponge Cola]], Boldstar, [[Sound (band)|Sound]], [[Drip (band)|Drip]], [[Rocksteddy]], [[Top Suzara]], [[Barbie Almalbis]], [[Kitchie Nadal]], [[Shamrock]], and [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]]. Their second volume, Kami nAPO muna Ulit has also included their new members in the compilation album are [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], [[Silent Sanctuary]], Concrete Sam, [[Up Dharma Down]], Chilitees, The Bloomfields, Scrambled Eggs, The Spaceflower Show, and [[Hilera]].\n\nAcoustic Balladeer Noel Cabangon also had a new tribute album to the pinoy pop musical group, ''Throwback: Ang Songbook Ng APO'' was launched in 2014 with features with his cover versions of popular various APO songs in his new album released by Universal Records.\n\n==2008-2009 Reunion==\nOn 20 September 2008, Apo Hiking Society had a reunion concert called \"Apo of the Philippines\" which was held at the Araneta Coliseum to celebrate their 39th Anniversary. They sang all of the APO Favorites and all songs from their past releases.\n\nOn February 7, 2009, The Apo performed in the Open Air FTI Complex in Taguig. The free concert was sponsored in cooperation with the Taguig City hall. One month later, the Eraserheads had their Final Set Concert.\n\nOn November 17, 2009, the Apo Hiking Society marked their 40th anniversary with a big concert at the SM North EDSA Skydome.  It was called \"APO Kayang-Kaya Pa\". This was originally scheduled on September 26 but was rescheduled due to the [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon \"Ondoy\" (\"Ketsana\")]].\n\n==2010 Retirement==\nLast December 16, 2009, the APO Hiking Society announced that they are already retiring as a group due to \"diminishing creative process.\" They performed a series of shows that started on February 14, 2010 and ended on May, just in time for the elections.<ref name=\"mb7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/13/10/apo-hiking-society-bidding-adieu-music-industry|title=APO Hiking Society bidding adieu to music industry|author=Reyma Buan-Deveza|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=abs-cbnnews.com}}</ref> They also reunited for the last time to perform in the [[Inauguration of Benigno Aquino III|Inauguration of President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III]] last June 30, 2010.\n\n==Post APO Hiking Society==\nAfter APO retired from singing, its members remained active in show business and are still performing:\n\nJim Paredes is still active in singing and also a photography hobbyist. And also a Liberal Party supporter, who spouts his dismay on the current government.\n\nBuboy Garovillo now has a career acting in both movie and television.\n\nDanny Javier continues to own ''Pidro: Ang Saplot Ng Bayan'' T-shirts and recently starred in ''[[Bangis]]'' on TV5 in 2010 as well as appeared in Season 3 of ''ASOP: A Song Of Praise Music Festival'' in 2014 as a guest judge.  As of 2018, Danny is retired from both singing and acting.\n\n==Film Musical==\nIn 2012, a [[Jukebox musical|movie musical]] based on APO songs was released.  Titled ''[[I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!|I Doo Bidoobidoo]]'', it was released on August 29.  The movie was inspired by ''[[Mamma Mia!|Mamma Mia]]'', a [[Musical theatre|musical]] that was based on and used [[ABBA]] songs, which later became a [[mamma Mia!
