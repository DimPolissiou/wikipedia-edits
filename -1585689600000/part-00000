The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 30 March, there have been 78 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nOther impacts and reactions include the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]], restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), [[panic buying]] of essential items and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services).

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 30 March, there have been 78 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nOther impacts and reactions include the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]], restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), [[panic buying]] of essential items and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services).

''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has multiple nests. Because of this, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce the cost in effort of food transport. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G.W. |last2=Bennett |title=Dispersed central-place foraging in the polydomous odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'', as revealed by a protein marker |journal=Insectes Sociaux |date=August 2006 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=282\u2013290 |doi=10.1007/s00040-006-0870-0}}</ref> It was also found that the half-life of the stay at any one nest was about 12.9&nbsp;days.<ref name=Smallwood1982>{{cite journal |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Nest relocations in ants |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=1982 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013147 |doi=10.1007/bf02228747}}</ref>\n\nBuczkowski and Bennett also studied the pattern of food movement within a nest. They labeled [[sucrose]] with Immunoglobin&nbsp;G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an [[enzyme]]-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through ''[[trophallaxis]]'' (one animal regurgitating food for another). Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the [[sucrose]]. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a [[dominance hierarchy]] even between queens. They also found that the nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\"/> It was also found that the rate of [[trophallaxis|trophallactic]] feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total individuals in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, and the size of the overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased.<ref name=\"forager number\">{{cite journal |last=Buczkowski |first=G. |author2=G.

Secondary orientation is when terrain has been explored, and there are pre-existing odor trails which ants use to orient themselves. When ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on topography. The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed. They use these types of surfaces to orient along, and lay the first odor trails, which can then be followed in the future, to the food source, by other ants.<ref name=\"spatial cues\">{{cite journal |last1=Klotz |first1=J.H. |first2=B.L. |last2=Reid |title=The use of spatial cues for structural guideline orientation in ''Tapinoma sessile'' and ''Camponotus pennsylvanicus'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) |journal=Journal of Insect Behavior |date=January 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201382 |doi=10.1007/bf01049159}}</ref>\n\n===Seasonal behaviors===\nIt was also found that this ant species practices seasonal ''polydomy'' (having multiple colony sites) to have access to multiple food sources. The colony will overwinter in a single nest, and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple nests. This allows them to better use food sources, that might be spread out. During the winter they will return again to the same nest location. Seasonal polydomy is rather rare, and only found in 10% of all polydomous species.<ref name=\"seasonal polydomy\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=Seasonal polydomy in a polygynous supercolony of the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2008 |volume=33 |pages=780\u2013788 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01034.x}}</ref> Seasonal polydomy is not found in many ant species, but there are many ant species, including ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', which move within a season: Migration to better forage sites is common.<ref name=Smallwood1982/>\n\nSeasonal activity patterns of the ants were also studied, and corresponding to the seasonal polydomy, it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between March and September and displayed almost no activity from October to December. Daily activity patterns were also studied. In March ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' foraged during the day, but in April that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and night. During most of the summer, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' shows low levels of activity throughout the day and night.<ref name=Fellers1989>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Daily and seasonal activity in woodland ants |journal=Oecologia |year=1989 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201376 |doi=10.1007/bf00377199 |bibcode=1989Oecol..78...69F}}</ref>\n\n===Competition with other ants===\n[[Competition (biology)|Competition]] between species is often classified as exploitation or interference. Exploitation involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other species, while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or aggression. When it comes to these behaviors, a species is considered ''dominant'' if it initiates an attack and ''subordinate'' if it avoids other species. In comparison with eight other ant species, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate scale. The ant does not show a large propensity for attack, preferring to use chemical secretions instead of biting.<ref name=Fellers1987>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Interference and exploitation in a guild of woodland ants |journal=Ecology |date=October 1987 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1466\u20131478 |doi=10.2307/1939230 |jstor=1939230}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', a subordinate species, was in the presence of dominant ant species such as ''C.&nbsp;ferrugineus'', ''P.&nbsp;imparis'', ''[[Lasius alienus]]'', and ''F.&nbsp;subsericea'', they reduced the amount of time spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis.

''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has multiple nests. Because of this, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce the cost in effort of food transport. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G.W. |last2=Bennett |title=Dispersed central-place foraging in the polydomous odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'', as revealed by a protein marker |journal=Insectes Sociaux |date=August 2006 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=282\u2013290 |doi=10.1007/s00040-006-0870-0}}</ref> It was also found that the half-life of the stay at any one nest was about 12.9&nbsp;days.<ref name=Smallwood1982>{{cite journal |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Nest relocations in ants |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=1982 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013147 |doi=10.1007/bf02228747}}</ref>\n\nBuczkowski and Bennett also studied the pattern of food movement within a nest. They labeled [[sucrose]] with Immunoglobin&nbsp;G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an [[enzyme]]-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through ''[[trophallaxis]]'' (one animal regurgitating food for another). Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the [[sucrose]]. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a [[dominance hierarchy]] even between queens. They also found that the nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\"/> It was also found that the rate of [[trophallaxis|trophallactic]] feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total individuals in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, and the size of the overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased.<ref name=\"forager number\">{{cite journal |last=Buczkowski |first=G. |author2=G.

Secondary orientation is when terrain has been explored, and there are pre-existing odor trails which ants use to orient themselves. When ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on topography. The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed. They use these types of surfaces to orient along, and lay the first odor trails, which can then be followed in the future, to the food source, by other ants.<ref name=\"spatial cues\">{{cite journal |last1=Klotz |first1=J.H. |first2=B.L. |last2=Reid |title=The use of spatial cues for structural guideline orientation in ''Tapinoma sessile'' and ''Camponotus pennsylvanicus'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) |journal=Journal of Insect Behavior |date=January 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201382 |doi=10.1007/bf01049159}}</ref>\n\n===Seasonal behaviors===\nIt was also found that this ant species practices seasonal ''polydomy'' (having multiple colony sites) to have access to multiple food sources. The colony will overwinter in a single nest, and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple nests. This allows them to better use food sources, that might be spread out. During the winter they will return again to the same nest location. Seasonal polydomy is rather rare, and only found in 10% of all polydomous species.<ref name=\"seasonal polydomy\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=Seasonal polydomy in a polygynous supercolony of the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2008 |volume=33 |pages=780\u2013788 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01034.x}}</ref> Seasonal polydomy is not found in many ant species, but there are many ant species, including ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', which move within a season: Migration to better forage sites is common.<ref name=Smallwood1982/>\n\nSeasonal activity patterns of the ants were also studied, and corresponding to the seasonal polydomy, it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between March and September and displayed almost no activity from October to December. Daily activity patterns were also studied. In March ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' foraged during the day, but in April that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and night. During most of the summer, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' shows low levels of activity throughout the day and night.<ref name=Fellers1989>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Daily and seasonal activity in woodland ants |journal=Oecologia |year=1989 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201376 |doi=10.1007/bf00377199 |bibcode=1989Oecol..78...69F}}</ref>\n\n===Competition with other ants===\n[[Competition (biology)|Competition]] between species is often classified as exploitation or interference. Exploitation involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other species, while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or aggression. When it comes to these behaviors, a species is considered ''dominant'' if it initiates an attack and ''subordinate'' if it avoids other species. In comparison with eight other ant species, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate scale. The ant does not show a large propensity for attack, preferring to use chemical secretions instead of biting.<ref name=Fellers1987>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Interference and exploitation in a guild of woodland ants |journal=Ecology |date=October 1987 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1466\u20131478 |doi=10.2307/1939230 |jstor=1939230}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', a subordinate species, was in the presence of dominant ant species such as ''C.&nbsp;ferrugineus'', ''P.&nbsp;imparis'', ''[[Lasius alienus]]'', and ''F.&nbsp;subsericea'', they reduced the amount of time spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the ''T.&nbsp;sissile'' forages at the same time as dominant species, but avoids other foraging ants, they must have excellent exploitative abilities to survive.<ref name=Fellers1989/>\n\nOne of the [[invasive species]] that ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has had to contend with is the [[Argentine ant]], ''Linepithema humile''.

Over the next 38 years, Mondor (who died in 2010) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success; it was twice (1990 and 2003) selected the winner of ''[[Baseball America]]'s'' Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/baseball-america-awards/|title=Baseball America Awards|magazine=[[Baseball America]]|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> led the league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lloyd|last2=Wolff|first2=Miles|title=The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball|edition=2nd|year=2008|publisher=[[Baseball America]]|location=[[Durham, North Carolina]]|isbn=978-1-932391-17-6|pages=561\u2013724}}</ref> and won three [[Governors' Cup]]s as playoff champions.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] [[Larry Lucchino]] and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington. Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility (first in adjacent [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], then in a downtown site in Pawtucket), the PawSox announced on August 17, 2018, that they will move to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], {{convert|42|mi}} away, in 2021. Ownership later confirmed that the team will become the '''[[Worcester Red Sox]]''' (nicknamed the '''WooSox''') with the move.\n\n==Team history==\n\n===Eastern League franchise (1970\u201372)===\nThe first team to be dubbed the Pawtucket Red Sox debuted at McCoy Stadium in 1970 as a member of the Double-A Eastern League. The franchise, owned by former Major League shortstop [[Joe Buzas]], had spent the previous five seasons (1965\u201369) as the [[Pittsfield Red Sox]] after playing in four different [[Pennsylvania]] cities\u2014[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]\u2014over seven years (1958\u201364).\n\nAfter three seasons, Pawtucket's Eastern League franchise moved to [[Bristol, Connecticut]], in 1973 to make room for the Triple-A PawSox, the former [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the International League.\n\n[[Carlton Fisk]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[catcher]], played for the Eastern League PawSox in 1970. [[Shortstop]] [[Rick Burleson]] and [[first baseman]] [[Cecil Cooper]] are among the players who toiled for both the Double-A and Triple-A versions of the team. This first edition of the PawSox franchise played for ten seasons as the [[Bristol Red Sox]] and then  spent 33 seasons (1983\u20132015) in [[New Britain, Connecticut]], the last 21 of them as the [[New Britain Rock Cats|Rock Cats]]. In 2016, the Rock Cats moved to [[Connecticut]]'s capital city, and were rechristened the [[Hartford Yard Goats]].\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] had also placed an Eastern League club in Pawtucket, in 1966\u201367. The [[Pawtucket Indians]] moved to [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], in 1968. The [[Pawtucket Slaters (baseball)|Pawtucket Slaters]], a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] farm club in the Class B [[New England League]], represented the city from 1946 to 1949, when the NEL disbanded.\n\n===Roots in Toronto and Louisville===\n{{See|Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)}}\n\nThe Triple-A team that is now the Pawtucket Red Sox began in 1896 as the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]]. After the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and its [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball team)|Louisville Colonels]] franchise folded in 1962 and the [[American League]] owners voted down [[Charlie O. Finley]]'s agreement to move the [[Kansas City A's]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] in 1964, Louisville was ready for the return of baseball. In 1968 the Maple Leafs, the Red Sox' top minor league club since 1965, were bought by Walter J. Dilbeck and moved to Louisville where they became the new Louisville Colonels and retained their affiliation with the Red Sox. They played at [[Cardinal Stadium|Fairgrounds Stadium]] on the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. While in Louisville, star players included [[Carlton Fisk]] (1971), [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (1972), and [[Cecil Cooper]] (1972). The Louisville Colonels made the International League playoffs in 1969 and 1972.\n\n===Early struggles and bankruptcy (1973\u201376)===\nIn 1972, the Kentucky State Fair Board remodeled Cardinal Stadium so it could accommodate [[American football|football]]. The renovations made the stadium unsuitable for baseball; among other things, it was far too large for a Triple-A team. However, the stadium was later used by the latter-day [[Louisville Bats|Louisville Redbirds]] club, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams. Following the 1972 season, the Louisville Colonels of the International League moved to McCoy Stadium and became the Pawtucket Red Sox, with Buzas taking over as owner.\n\nThe first Triple-A team was a success on the field, led by future major leaguers Cecil Cooper and [[Dick Pole]], winning the 1973 [[Governors' Cup]] Championship in their inaugural year in the league over the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees|Charleston Charlies]]. Then, they followed up by defeating the [[Tulsa Oilers (baseball)|Tulsa Oilers]] of the American Association to win the [[Junior World Series]]. The following season they finished 30 games below .500 and lost an estimated $40,000. Buzas then sold the team to Philip Anez, a [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]] advertising executive, in January 1975.<ref>[https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/435945474/?terms=Joe%2BBuzas [[Boston Globe]] archives, 9 January 1975]</ref>\n\nWhile the parent club was on their way to the [[1975 World Series]], the 1975 PawSox finished with a 53\u201387 mark.{{Anchor|Rhode Island Red Sox}} The team changed its name to the ''Rhode Island Red Sox'' for the 1976 season, but little changed on the field with a third straight sub-.500 season and falling attendance. Anez threatened to move his club to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. After the season, the franchise went bankrupt, unable to pay off $2 million worth of debt. The International League took it over, then awarded it in December 1976 to Massachusetts businessman Marvin Adelson, who renamed the team the ''New England Red Sox''\u2014and explored transferring it to Worcester. But after less than two months, in January 1977, the league revoked Adelson's franchise, alleging \"nonperformance of terms and conditions\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/436614886/?terms=%22Marv%2BAdelson%22|title=IL Withdraws RI Sox Franchise Offer|last=United Press International|date=19 January 1977|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] archives|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Ben Mondor era (1977\u20132015)===\nAlthough it appeared the Red Sox's stay in the Pawtucket area was about to come to an end, retired [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]] businessman [[Ben Mondor]] stepped in and made sure the team remained in the city. Mondor was granted a brand-new franchise and restored the name to the Pawtucket Red Sox. However, it retained the old team's history and affiliation with the big-league Red Sox. Nonetheless, it was really in 1977 that the current Pawtucket Red Sox, and PawSox, were born.\n\nMondor's tenure began inauspiciously. While the PawSox rebounded to win the regular-season [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], they only drew 1,000 fans per game\u2014believed to be the fewest for a first-place team in the history of the International League. That year's edition of the PawSox fell in the Governors' Cup finals to Charleston in four straight games. However, it won its second league championship in 1984, and drew almost 199,000 fans, second in the league.\n\nAfter several years of playing in a stadium that was barely suitable for a Triple-A team, in 1998 Mondor and team president Mike Tamburro oversaw the transformation of McCoy Stadium from an aging 1942 relic into its renovated form. While they kept the price of tickets at $6 and $10,<ref>[http://www.pawsox.com/tickets/ PawSox.com \u2013 PawSox Tickets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> parking is free. The PawSox led the league in attendance in 2008, when 636,788 fans saw baseball at McCoy, an average of 9,097 for each of the 70 openings. In 2005, they set a franchise record with 688,421 tickets sold during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=International League: Attendance|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=l_att&lid=117|website=www.milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Kevin Youkilis]] played for the team in 2003, and completed a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate [[Kevin Millar]]'s minor-league records for consecutive games reaching base.\n\nIn addition to their success at the box office, the PawSox have excelled on the field. In 2000, Pawtucket set an all-time franchise record for victories with 82, as the team completed their fifth-straight winning season. Three years later the PawSox would top their own record by winning 83 games. In 2008, they won 85 games. The 1984 team defeated the now-defunct [[Maine Guides]] 3\u20132 to win the 1984 Governors' Cup trophy for their second championship in Pawtucket Red Sox history. In 2012, the PawSox defeated the [[Charlotte Knights]] to win the Governors' Cup for a third time. A fourth title was won in 2014 when the PawSox took down the [[Durham Bulls]] in five games.\n\nThe origins of PawSox are traced back to the first season in which Mondor owned the club. Three weeks before the 1977 season began the team lacked uniforms. BoSox vice president [[Haywood Sullivan]] stepped in and sent Pawtucket 48 sets of old home and away uniforms from the parent club. Although the home uniforms were fine for the team to use, the road uniforms had \"Boston\" stitched across the chest, which was a problem. Tamburro suggested using the name \"PawSox\" across the front, with each unstitched \"Boston\" letter replaced with one that spelled \"PawSox\". Thus, the PawSox name was born out of the necessity of a uniform crisis.\n\nMondor died on October 3, 2010, at the age of 85. His widow, Madeleine, became the new majority owner of the PawSox.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/pawsox/content/sp_bb_mondor_15_05-16-11_L9O4326_v3.2a3c68a.html ''The Providence Journal'', 2011-5-16]</ref>\n\n===Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015\u201318)===\nOn November 29, 2014, it was reported that members of the Boston Red Sox' ownership group were in the process of purchasing the PawSox from Madeleine Mondor and two long-time executives who also held stock in the team: president Tamburro and vice president and general manager Lou Schwechheimer.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/11/27/some-red-sox-owners-poised-purchase-pawsox/Tj3YDozeBmap2p8bEO6qGM/story.html Some Red Sox owners poised to purchase PawSox ''Boston Globe'' 2014-11-29]</ref>\n\nNearly three months later, on February 23, the sale to Lucchino, Skeffington and their partners was formally announced.

The male mascot is Paws.]]\nThe '''Pawtucket Red Sox''' (known [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as the '''PawSox''') are a professional [[minor league baseball]] team based in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. The team is a member of the [[International League]] and is the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. It plays its home games at [[McCoy Stadium]] in Pawtucket, and is the only [[professional baseball]] team in [[Rhode Island]]. Its most recent [[List of International League champions|championship]] win was in 2014.\n\nThe Pawtucket Red Sox were born as a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] franchise in 1970. Three years later, Boston's Triple-A affiliate in the International League replaced the Eastern League PawSox. After enduring three different owners, at least two threats to move the team elsewhere, and bankruptcy, the PawSox were purchased from the International League by local industrialist [[Ben Mondor]] in January 1977. Over the next 38 years, Mondor (who died in 2010) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success; it was twice (1990 and 2003) selected the winner of ''[[Baseball America]]'s'' Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/baseball-america-awards/|title=Baseball America Awards|magazine=[[Baseball America]]|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> led the league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lloyd|last2=Wolff|first2=Miles|title=The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball|edition=2nd|year=2008|publisher=[[Baseball America]]|location=[[Durham, North Carolina]]|isbn=978-1-932391-17-6|pages=561\u2013724}}</ref> and won three [[Governors' Cup]]s as playoff champions.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] [[Larry Lucchino]] and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington. Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility (first in adjacent [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], then in a downtown site in Pawtucket), the PawSox announced on August 17, 2018, that they will move to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], {{convert|42|mi}} away, in 2021. Ownership later confirmed that the team will become the '''[[Worcester Red Sox]]''' (nicknamed the '''WooSox''') with the move.\n\n==Team history==\n\n===Eastern League franchise (1970\u201372)===\nThe first team to be dubbed the Pawtucket Red Sox debuted at McCoy Stadium in 1970 as a member of the Double-A Eastern League. The franchise, owned by former Major League shortstop [[Joe Buzas]], had spent the previous five seasons (1965\u201369) as the [[Pittsfield Red Sox]] after playing in four different [[Pennsylvania]] cities\u2014[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]\u2014over seven years (1958\u201364).\n\nAfter three seasons, Pawtucket's Eastern League franchise moved to [[Bristol, Connecticut]], in 1973 to make room for the Triple-A PawSox, the former [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the International League.\n\n[[Carlton Fisk]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[catcher]], played for the Eastern League PawSox in 1970. [[Shortstop]] [[Rick Burleson]] and [[first baseman]] [[Cecil Cooper]] are among the players who toiled for both the Double-A and Triple-A versions of the team. This first edition of the PawSox franchise played for ten seasons as the [[Bristol Red Sox]] and then  spent 33 seasons (1983\u20132015) in [[New Britain, Connecticut]], the last 21 of them as the [[New Britain Rock Cats|Rock Cats]]. In 2016, the Rock Cats moved to [[Connecticut]]'s capital city, and were rechristened the [[Hartford Yard Goats]].\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] had also placed an Eastern League club in Pawtucket, in 1966\u201367. The [[Pawtucket Indians]] moved to [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], in 1968. The [[Pawtucket Slaters (baseball)|Pawtucket Slaters]], a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] farm club in the Class B [[New England League]], represented the city from 1946 to 1949, when the NEL disbanded.\n\n===Roots in Toronto and Louisville===\n{{See|Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)}}\n\nThe Triple-A team that is now the Pawtucket Red Sox began in 1896 as the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]]. After the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and its [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball team)|Louisville Colonels]] franchise folded in 1962 and the [[American League]] owners voted down [[Charlie O. Finley]]'s agreement to move the [[Kansas City A's]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] in 1964, Louisville was ready for the return of baseball. In 1968 the Maple Leafs, the Red Sox' top minor league club since 1965, were bought by Walter J. Dilbeck and moved to Louisville where they became the new Louisville Colonels and retained their affiliation with the Red Sox. They played at [[Cardinal Stadium|Fairgrounds Stadium]] on the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. While in Louisville, star players included [[Carlton Fisk]] (1971), [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (1972), and [[Cecil Cooper]] (1972). The Louisville Colonels made the International League playoffs in 1969 and 1972.\n\n===Early struggles and bankruptcy (1973\u201376)===\nIn 1972, the Kentucky State Fair Board remodeled Cardinal Stadium so it could accommodate [[American football|football]]. The renovations made the stadium unsuitable for baseball; among other things, it was far too large for a Triple-A team. However, the stadium was later used by the latter-day [[Louisville Bats|Louisville Redbirds]] club, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams. Following the 1972 season, the Louisville Colonels of the International League moved to McCoy Stadium and became the Pawtucket Red Sox, with Buzas taking over as owner.\n\nThe first Triple-A team was a success on the field, led by future major leaguers Cecil Cooper and [[Dick Pole]], winning the 1973 [[Governors' Cup]] Championship in their inaugural year in the league over the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees|Charleston Charlies]]. Then, they followed up by defeating the [[Tulsa Oilers (baseball)|Tulsa Oilers]] of the American Association to win the [[Junior World Series]]. The following season they finished 30 games below .500 and lost an estimated $40,000. Buzas then sold the team to Philip Anez, a [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]] advertising executive, in January 1975.<ref>[https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/435945474/?terms=Joe%2BBuzas [[Boston Globe]] archives, 9 January 1975]</ref>\n\nWhile the parent club was on their way to the [[1975 World Series]], the 1975 PawSox finished with a 53\u201387 mark.{{Anchor|Rhode Island Red Sox}} The team changed its name to the ''Rhode Island Red Sox'' for the 1976 season, but little changed on the field with a third straight sub-.500 season and falling attendance. Anez threatened to move his club to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. After the season, the franchise went bankrupt, unable to pay off $2 million worth of debt. The International League took it over, then awarded it in December 1976 to Massachusetts businessman Marvin Adelson, who renamed the team the ''New England Red Sox''\u2014and explored transferring it to Worcester. But after less than two months, in January 1977, the league revoked Adelson's franchise, alleging \"nonperformance of terms and conditions\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/436614886/?terms=%22Marv%2BAdelson%22|title=IL Withdraws RI Sox Franchise Offer|last=United Press International|date=19 January 1977|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] archives|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Ben Mondor era (1977\u20132015)===\nAlthough it appeared the Red Sox's stay in the Pawtucket area was about to come to an end, retired [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]] businessman [[Ben Mondor]] stepped in and made sure the team remained in the city. Mondor was granted a brand-new franchise and restored the name to the Pawtucket Red Sox. However, it retained the old team's history and affiliation with the big-league Red Sox. Nonetheless, it was really in 1977 that the current Pawtucket Red Sox, and PawSox, were born.\n\nMondor's tenure began inauspiciously. While the PawSox rebounded to win the regular-season [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], they only drew 1,000 fans per game\u2014believed to be the fewest for a first-place team in the history of the International League. That year's edition of the PawSox fell in the Governors' Cup finals to Charleston in four straight games. However, it won its second league championship in 1984, and drew almost 199,000 fans, second in the league.\n\nAfter several years of playing in a stadium that was barely suitable for a Triple-A team, in 1998 Mondor and team president Mike Tamburro oversaw the transformation of McCoy Stadium from an aging 1942 relic into its renovated form. While they kept the price of tickets at $6 and $10,<ref>[http://www.pawsox.com/tickets/ PawSox.com \u2013 PawSox Tickets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> parking is free. The PawSox led the league in attendance in 2008, when 636,788 fans saw baseball at McCoy, an average of 9,097 for each of the 70 openings. In 2005, they set a franchise record with 688,421 tickets sold during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=International League: Attendance|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=l_att&lid=117|website=www.milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Kevin Youkilis]] played for the team in 2003, and completed a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate [[Kevin Millar]]'s minor-league records for consecutive games reaching base.\n\nIn addition to their success at the box office, the PawSox have excelled on the field. In 2000, Pawtucket set an all-time franchise record for victories with 82, as the team completed their fifth-straight winning season. Three years later the PawSox would top their own record by winning 83 games. In 2008, they won 85 games. The 1984 team defeated the now-defunct [[Maine Guides]] 3\u20132 to win the 1984 Governors' Cup trophy for their second championship in Pawtucket Red Sox history. In 2012, the PawSox defeated the [[Charlotte Knights]] to win the Governors' Cup for a third time. A fourth title was won in 2014 when the PawSox took down the [[Durham Bulls]] in five games.\n\nThe origins of PawSox are traced back to the first season in which Mondor owned the club. Three weeks before the 1977 season began the team lacked uniforms. BoSox vice president [[Haywood Sullivan]] stepped in and sent Pawtucket 48 sets of old home and away uniforms from the parent club. Although the home uniforms were fine for the team to use, the road uniforms had \"Boston\" stitched across the chest, which was a problem. Tamburro suggested using the name \"PawSox\" across the front, with each unstitched \"Boston\" letter replaced with one that spelled \"PawSox\". Thus, the PawSox name was born out of the necessity of a uniform crisis.\n\nMondor died on October 3, 2010, at the age of 85. His widow, Madeleine, became the new majority owner of the PawSox.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/pawsox/content/sp_bb_mondor_15_05-16-11_L9O4326_v3.2a3c68a.html ''The Providence Journal'', 2011-5-16]</ref>\n\n===Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015\u201318)===\nOn November 29, 2014, it was reported that members of the Boston Red Sox' ownership group were in the process of purchasing the PawSox from Madeleine Mondor and two long-time executives who also held stock in the team: president Tamburro and vice president and general manager Lou Schwechheimer.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/11/27/some-red-sox-owners-poised-purchase-pawsox/Tj3YDozeBmap2p8bEO6qGM/story.html Some Red Sox owners poised to purchase PawSox ''Boston Globe'' 2014-11-29]</ref>\n\nNearly three months later, on February 23, the sale to Lucchino, Skeffington and their partners was formally announced. Lucchino added the title of chairman of the PawSox to his Boston responsibilities, and Skeffington became club president. Other partners included Rhode Island businessmen Bernard Cammarata, William P. Egan, Habib Gorgi, J. Terrence Murray and Thomas M.

The announcement capped a concerted three-year effort by Worcester and Massachusetts officials and local business leaders to woo the PawSox to anchor a downtown redevelopment that includes the stadium, new housing, a hotel, a parking garage and redesign of the Kelley Square intersection.<ref name=\"move818\"/> On September 12, 2018, the Worcester City Council voted 9\u20131 to approve the stadium proposal, paving the way for the PawSox' relocation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegram.com/news/20180912/worcester-council-approves-baseball-stadium-deal-9-1|title=Worcester Council Approves Baseball Stadium Deal, 9\u20131|last=Kotsopoulos|first=Nick|date=September 12, 2018|website=[[Worcester Telegram and Gazette]]|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{more|Worcester Red Sox}}\n\n==\"The Longest Game\"==\n{{main|Longest professional baseball game}}\nThe PawSox played in and won the longest game in professional baseball history, a 33-inning affair against the [[Rochester Red Wings]] at McCoy Stadium. The game started on April 18, 1981. Play was suspended at 4:07&nbsp;a.m. at the end of the 32nd inning. The game did not resume again until June 23, when the Red Wings returned to Pawtucket. Only one inning was needed, with the PawSox winning 3\u20132 in the bottom of the 33rd when first baseman [[Dave Koza]] drove in the leadoff hitter, second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]], with a bases-loaded single off Cliff Speck.

The 35th anniversary was also commemorated on April 19, 2016.\n\n==Perfect games==\n* [[Tomo Ohka]] pitched a nine-inning [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] for the Pawtucket Red Sox on June 1, 2000. Ohka retired all 27 batters he faced in a 2\u20130 win over the [[Charlotte Knights]], and he needed just 76 pitches to toss the first nine-inning perfect game in the International League since 1952.\n* On August 10, 2003, [[Bronson Arroyo]] pitched the fourth nine-inning perfect game in the 121-year history of the International League as the PawSox beat the [[Buffalo Bisons]] 7\u20130 at McCoy Stadium. He needed 101 pitches to throw his masterpiece (73 strikes), [[Strikeout|struck out]] nine, and got 10 [[Batted ball|fly outs]] and eight [[Ground out (baseball)|ground outs]] from the Buffalo 27 batters. He went to a three-ball count to just three hitters all game. At the end of the month, he was promoted to the majors, and remained with the Red Sox until the 2005\u201306 offseason, when the Red Sox traded him to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for [[Wily Mo Pena]].\n\n==Halls of fame==\n[[File:Jim Rice 1976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jim Rice]] is an inductee of the [[International League Hall of Fame]], the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], and the PawSox Hall of Fame.]]\n\nSeveral PawSox players and personnel have been inducted into the [[International League Hall of Fame]].
