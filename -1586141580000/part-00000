These women engaged in battle alongside [[samurai]] men mostly in times of need. They were members of the ''bushi'' ([[samurai]]) class in [[Feudalism|feudal]] Japan and were trained in the use of weapons to protect their household, family, and honour in times of war. Significant [[icons]] such as [[Tomoe Gozen]], [[Nakano Takeko]], and [[H\u014dj\u014d Masako]] are famous examples of onna-bugeisha.\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nLong before the emergence of the renowned [[samurai]] class, Japanese fighters were highly trained to wield a sword and spear. Women learned to use [[naginata]], [[kaiken]], and the art of [[tantojutsu]] in battle. Such training ensured protection in communities that lacked male fighters. One such woman, later known as [[Empress Jing\u016b]] (c. 169\u2013269 AD), used her skills to inspire [[Economy|economic]] and [[Social Change: Journal of the Council for Social Development|social change]]. She was recognized as the onna bugeisha who led an [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|invasion of Korea]] in 200 AD after her husband [[Emperor Ch\u016bai]], the fourteenth emperor of Japan, was slain in battle.<ref name=\"imes.boj.or.jp\">[http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/cm/english_htmls/history_18sub.htm History of Japanese.

Despite controversies surrounding her existence and her accomplishments, she was an example of the onna bugeisha in its entirety. Years after her death, Jing\u016b was able to transcend the socioeconomic structures that were instilled in Japan. In 1881, Empress Jing\u016b became the first woman to be featured on a [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen|Japanese banknote]].

The epic ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' was composed in the early 13th century in order to commemorate the stories of courageous and devoted [[samurai]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCullough|first1=Helen|title=The Tale of the Heike|date=1988|publisher=Stanford UP|location=Stanford, CA|page=6}}</ref>  Among those was [[Tomoe Gozen]], servant of [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka]] of the [[Minamoto clan]]. She assisted [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka|Yoshinaka]] in defending himself against the forces of his cousin, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], especially during the [[Battle of Awazu]] on February 21, 1184.\n\nIn ''The Tale of the Heike'', written at the beginning of 14th century, she was described:\n{{quote|... especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swords-woman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.<ref name=\"koryu.com\">[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj1.html#Introduction Women Warriors of Japan: Early History]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\nAlthough she was not proven to be a historical figure, Tomoe Gozen has impacted much of the warrior class, including many traditional Naginata schools. Her actions in battle also received much attention in the arts plays such as Tomoe no Monogatari and various [[ukiyo-e]]. As time passed, the influence of onna-bugeisha saw its way from paintings to politics.[[File:Hangaku Gozen by Yoshitoshi.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hangaku Gozen]]]]Another famous female general of the Genpei War was [[Hangaku Gozen]]. While Tomoe Gozen was an ally of the Minamoto clan, Hangaku allied with the Taira clan. The existence of these two prominent female generals confirms that the status of women during this time was still less unequal than future periods. Several other women are supposed to have acted as samurai during this period, but many of them have been omitted from history.\n\nIn ages past, it was more common to see women become reigning empresses, this would change in the future during the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji restoration]]. Throughout Japanese history, women, while not generally becoming ''[[de jure]]'' chiefs of a samurai clan, several ''[[de facto]]'' ruled their clans.\n\nAfter the Heike were thwarted towards the western provinces of Japan, the [[Kamakura shogunate]] (1185\u20131333) was soon established under the rule of Minamoto no Yoritomo. After he passed, his wife, [[H\u014dj\u014d Masako]], acting in the early years of the H\u014dj\u014d regency, became the first onna-bugeisha to be a prominent player in politics. Masako became a [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]], a traditional fate of samurai widows, and continued her involvement in politics, influencing the fates of her sons [[Minamoto no Yoriie]] and [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]], the second and third sh\u014dgun, and of the [[H\u014dj\u014d clan|H\u014dj\u014d]] faction at the sh\u014dguns' court.<ref>[http://www.samurai-archives.com/masako.html H\u014dj\u014d Masako]</ref>\n\nThrough the collective efforts of Masako and a few political puppets, laws governing the sh\u014dgun's court in the early 13th century allowed women equal rights of inheritance with fraternal kin. Even though the primary role of women in ancient Japan continued to be the support to their family and their husbands, they acquired a higher status in the household. These laws also allowed Japanese women to control finances, bequeath property, maintain their homes, manage servants, and raise their children with proper, loyal, samurai upbringing. Japanese women were also expected to defend their homes in times of war.\n[[File:Battle of Awazugahara.jpg|center|thumb|411x411px|[[Tomoe Gozen]] in the [[Battle of Awazu]]]]\n\n=== Sengoku Period ===\n\nDuring the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga Shogunate]], due to tensions between the shogunate [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]], Japan goes to war again. In 1460, when shogun [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] abdicated his position to his younger brother [[Ashikaga Yoshimi]], [[Hino Tomiko]] (Yoshimasa's wife) was strongly against this decision. Tomiko sought political and military support to rule as regent until the birth of her son, she secured the support of [[Yamana S\u014dzen]] and other leaders of powerful samurai clans. Then she went to war against Yoshimasa and his supporters, especially the [[Hosokawa clan]]. This dispute for succession started the [[\u014cnin War]] (1467-1477) and led to the begin of the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&stype=0&dtype=0&dname=0ss&p=%E6%97%A5%E9%87%8E%E5%AF%8C%E5%AD%90|title=Hino Tomiko|work=[[Daijirin]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804061906/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8|archivedate=2009-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:\u5c0f\u677e\u59eb.jpg|left|thumb|303x303px|[[Komatsuhime]], fought in the Siege of Ueda and challenged [[Sanada Masayuki]] and [[Sanada Yukimura]] at the entrance of Numata Castle.]]In the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]] several daimyos took charge of their own affairs and fought against each other by territory, women of noble clans and even peasant women members of [[Ikk\u014d-ikki]], [[Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b|Ikk\u014d-shu]], [[Saika Ikki]] and others Ikki sects went to the battlefields. In 1569, [[Lady Ichikawa|Ichikawa no Tsubone]], the wife of a [[M\u014dri clan|Mori]] family retainer from western Japan. When her husband was absent from the campaign, she assumed responsibility for the defense of Konomine castle with her armed  [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]. Attacks on the yamashiro (the mountaintop castles), the characteristic fortress of the daimyo, have provided many unwanted opportunities for women to engage in defense and suffer the ultimate sacrifice if the castle falls. \n\nWomen participated in battles until the unification of Japan by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In 1591 several women defended [[Kunohe Castle]] even when it was on fire in the [[Kunohe Rebellion]]. After Hideyoshi's death, his concubine [[Yodo-dono]] took over the [[De facto|''De facto'']] leadership of the Toyotomi clan and in 1614 she and her son, [[Toyotomi Hideyori|Hideyori]], led a rebellion against the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. In 1615, when [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] attacked [[Osaka Castle|Osaka castle]] again, Yodo-dono and her son committed suicide in the flames of Osaka castle. Suicide inside a burning castle may have been the last act of loyalty to a samurai-class woman.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Evidence of female participation in battles ====\nDuring the [[Sengoku period]] there are several accounts of women actively on the battlefield, such as the case of [[Myorin]] who inspired the people to fought against 3,000 [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] soldiers, [[Kaihime]] who fought against the [[Toyotomi clan]] in the [[Siege of Oshi]] (1590), [[Onamihime]] who became the representative leader of the [[Nikaid\u014d clan]] and fought in various battles against her nephew [[Date Masamune]]. [[Akai Teruko]], who became famous for fighting until she was 76 years old and became known as <nowiki>''The Strongest Woman in the Warring States Period''</nowiki>. The heroic [[Tsuruhime]], who is said to be the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Joan of Arc of Japan<nowiki>''</nowiki>, is one of the several examples of how the Onna-bugeisha played a crucial role in japanese history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Hojo_Masako_(Takeda_Katsuyori's_wife).jpg|thumb|[[Takeda Katsuyori#Personal life|Hojo Masako]] (Takeda Katsuyori's wife) carrying a naginata in the [[Battle of Tenmokuzan]].]]\nJapanese women were educated to become wives and mothers, although most women knew about politics, martial arts and diplomacy, they were not allowed to succeed clan leadership. However, there were exceptions, [[Ii Naotora]] took over the clan leadership after the death of all men of the Ii family, her efforts as a leader made her clan independent and she became a [[Daimy\u014d]]. There were many noble women with great political influence in their clans, even becoming the ''[[de facto]]'' leader. An acceptable example of women who became known as ''<nowiki>''onna daimyo''</nowiki> (''[[Landlord|female landlord]]) are [[Jukei-ni]] and [[T\u014dsh\u014din|Toshoin]]. Both women acted, for a long period, as rulers of their respective [[Feud|feuds]], even though they were not considered [[heirs]].\n\nIn the 16th century there were units consisting only of women, as was the case of [[Ikeda Sen]] who led 200 women [[musketeer]]s ([[Firearms of Japan|Teppo unit]]) in the [[Battle of Shizugatake]] and [[Battle of Komaki and Nagakute|Battle of Komaki-Nagakute]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAMLAAAAMAAJ&q=%E6%B1%A0%E7%94%B0%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93&dq=%E6%B1%A0%E7%94%B0%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ4ZWc5JTiAhWZJbkGHUkiB5IQ6AEIRTAE|title=\u5099\u524d\u85e9\u5e55\u672b\u7dad\u65b0\u53f2\u8ac7|last=\u8352\u6728\u7950\u81e3|date=1978|publisher=\u65e5\u672c\u6587\u654e\u51fa\u7248|language=ja}}</ref> [[Otazu no kata]] fought alongside 18 armed maids against [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa Ieyasu's]] troops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/946584/353|title=\u6b66\u5bb6\u4e8b\u7d00. \u3000\u4e0a\u5dfb - \u56fd\u7acb\u56fd\u4f1a\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|website=dl.ndl.go.jp|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> [[Ueno Tsuruhime]] led thirty-four women in a suicidal charge against the M\u014dri army.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYyFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=ueno+Tsuruhime&source=bl&ots=n9urpF0l13&sig=ACfU3U0IVdXceonE_be05ciCkm9v7BxlJQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwinjOP7gMjhAhWLEbkGHUQEA4IQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=ueno%20Tsuruhime|title=Women Warriors: An Unexpected History|last=Toler|first=Pamela D.|date=2019-02-26|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807064320|language=en}}</ref> [[Tachibana Ginchiyo]], leader of the Tachibana clan fought with her female troops in the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign|Kyushu Campaign]] (1586) and in the [[Siege of Yanagawa]] (1600) she organized a resistance formed by nuns against the advance of the [[Battle of Sekigahara|Eastern Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.tiki.ne.jp/~shirabe01/bu/onna/tb/gin001.htm|title=\u9ad8\u6a4b\u30fb\u7acb\u82b1\u5bb6\u306e\u5973\u6027|website=ww2.tiki.ne.jp}}</ref>  These warrior women are presumed to be a minority, but recent studies show that women have always been on the battlefield. The samurai women were not unique to the castle's defense, but also traveled with other men to conquer territories. \n\nIn 1580, a woman from the Bessho clan joins a rebellion against Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the [[Siege of Miki]]. Her husband Bessho Yoshichika was one of the leaders of the rebellion and she plays a key role during the siege, allying herself with the Mori clan. The rebellion lasted three years, until [[Bessho Nagaharu]] surrendered the castle to Hideyoshi, Lady Bessho commits suicide shortly after. In 1582, [[Oda Nobunaga]] launched a final attack on the [[Takeda clan]], a series of battles known as the [[Battle of Tenmokuzan]]. [[Oda Nobutada]] (son of Nobunaga) led 50,000 soldiers, against 3,000 allies of the Takeda clan during the [[Takat\u014d Castle|Siege of Takato castle]]. During this battle, it is recorded in the compilation of chronicles from the [[Oda clan]], [[Shinch\u014d k\u014dki]], that a woman from the [[Suwa clan]] defies Nobutada's forces. The fact that these women have no names recorded in history reiterates the argument that many reports of samurai women participating in battles have been omitted and lost over the years.\n[[File:Illustrated Story of Night Attack on Yoshitsune's Residence At Horikawa, 16th Century 2.jpg|left|thumb|269x269px|Women accompanying men in a battle. (16th century illustration).]]\nDuring this era, the existence of female [[Ninja]]s ([[Kunoichi]]) is dated, their training differed from the training given to male ninjas, although they also had a core in common as they trained in [[taijutsu]], [[kenjutsu]], [[ninjutsu]] skills. A historically accepted example is [[Mochizuki Chiyome]], a 16th-century noble descendant who was commissioned by warlord [[Takeda Shingen]] to recruit women to create a secret network of hundreds of spies.<ref>Thomas A. Green, ''Martial Arts of the World'' (2001), p. 671.</ref>\n\nIt is believed that many more women participated in battles than those written in historical records. For example, DNA tests on 105 bodies excavated from the Battle of Senbon Matsubaru between [[Takeda Katsuyori]] and [[H\u014dj\u014d Ujinao|Hojo Ujinao]] in 1580 revealed that 35 of them were women. Other excavations were made in areas where battles took place away from castles. Several female casualties in sieges are common, but according to recent studies show that 30% of the corpses of battles away from castles were women. According to [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]], the details of the excavation confirm the Onna-bugeishas were almost certainly present in the battlefields.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7GHCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=pt-BR#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Samurai Women 1184\u20131877|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|date=2012-01-20|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781780963334|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Edo Period and beyond===\n[[File:nakanotakeko.jpg|thumb|[[Nakano Takeko]] died at the [[Battle of Aizu]].]]\n<!--Comments moved from article space to talk page.-->\nBecause of the influence of [[Edo neo-Confucianism]] (1600\u20131868), the status of the onna-bugeisha diminished significantly. The function of onna-bugeisha changed in addition to their husbands. [[Samurai]] were no longer concerned with battles and war, they were [[bureaucrat]]s. Women, specifically daughters of most upper class households, were soon pawns to dreams of success and power. The roaring ideals of fearless devotion and selflessness were gradually replaced by quiet, passive, civil obedience.\n\nTravel during the Edo period was demanding and unsettling for many female samurai (because of heavy restrictions). They always had to be accompanied by a man, since they were not allowed to travel by themselves. Additionally, they had to possess specific permits, establishing their business and motives. Samurai women also received much harassment from officials who manned inspection checkpoints.\n[[File:Japanese Swordswoman.jpg|left|thumb|221x221px|''[[Kenjutsu]]'' practitioner (Swordswoman) in a duel.]]\nThe onset of the 17th century marked a significant transformation in the social acceptance of women in Japan. Many samurai viewed women purely as child bearers; the concept of a woman being a fit companion for war was no longer conceivable. The relationship between a husband and wife could be correlated to that of a lord and his vassal. \"Husbands and wives did not even customarily sleep together. The husband would visit his wife to initiate any sexual activity and afterwards would retire to his own room\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj2.html#Warring Women Warriors of Japan: The Edo Period, an Enforced Peace]</ref>\n\nAlthough women learned exclusively Naginata handling techniques, some women broke traditionalism and learned different techniques such as ''[[Kenjutsu]].'' [[Sasaki Rui]], [[Hokushin Itt\u014d-ry\u016b#Famous Swordmen|Chiba Sanako]] and [[Nakazawa Koto]] are examples of women who became prominent [[swordsmen|swordswomen]] in Edo period. During this time, female-led ''kenjutsu'' schools become commonplace, although traditionally the leadership of these schools is inherited [[Patrilineality|patrilinely]].\n\nIn 1868, during the [[Battle of Aizu]], a part of the [[Boshin War]], [[Nakano Takeko]], a member of the [[Aizu]] clan, was recruited to become leader of a female corps ''J\u014dshitai'' (\u5a18\u5b50\u968a ''Girls's Army''). who fought against the onslaught of 20,000 soldiers of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] of the [[\u014cgaki Domain]]. Highly skilled at the naginata, Takeko and her corps of about 20 joined 3000 other Aizu samurai in battle. The H\u014dkai-ji in [[Aizubange]], Fukushima province contains a [[monument]] erected in her honor. Less-celebrated but no less remarkable would be the efforts of [[Yamamoto Yaeko]], [[Matsudaira Teru]] and [[Yamakawa Futaba]], who served as fighter defending [[Aizuwakamatsu Castle]] during the [[Battle of Aizu]]. Yaeko would later be one of the first civil leaders for [[women's rights]] in Japan.\n\n== Weapons ==\n[[File:Nakanotakekostatue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Nakano Takeko]] holding a naginata.]]\nThe most popular weapon-of-choice of onna-bugeisha is the [[naginata]], which is a versatile, conventional [[polearm]] with a curved blade at the tip. The weapon is mainly favored for its length, which can compensate for the strength and body size advantage of male opponents.<ref name=\"koryu.com 2\">[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj1.html#Introduction Women Warriors of Japan: The Edo Period, an Enforced Peace]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe naginata has a niche between the [[katana]] and the [[yari]], which is rather effective in close quarter [[melee]] when the opponent is kept at bay, and is also relatively efficient against [[cavalry]]. Through its use by many legendary samurai women, the naginata has been propelled as the iconic image of a woman warrior. During the Edo Period, many schools focusing on the use of the naginata were created and perpetuated its association with women.\n\nAdditionally, as most of the time their primary purpose as onna-bugeisha was to safeguard their homes from marauders, emphasis was laid on ranged weapons to be shot from defensive structures.<ref name=\"koryu.com 2\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Girl warriors in 2006 Aizu parade.JPG|thumb|A group of girls celebrating the Women army in Aizu Parade (2006)]]\nThe image of samurai women continues to be impactful in martial arts, [[Historical fiction|historical novels]], [[book]]s and [[popular culture]] in general. Like the kunoichis (female ninja) and [[Geisha]]s, the Onna-bugeisha's conduct is seen as the ideal of a Japanese women in movies, animations and TV series. In western, the Onna-bugeishas gained popularity when the historical documentary ''Samurai Warrior Queens'' aired on the [[Smithsonian Channel]]. Several other channels reprised the documentary. The 56th NHK taiga drama, [[Naotora: The Lady Warlord]] it was the first NHK drama where the female protagonist is the head of a samurai clan. The 52nd [[NHK]] [[taiga drama]], [[Yae no Sakura]] focuses on [[Niijima Yae]], a woman warrior who fought in [[Boshin War]], this drama portrays Nakano Takeko, Matsudaira Teru and others onna-bugeishas. Other taiga dramas portray famous onna-bugeishas, H\u014dj\u014d Masako and Tomoe Gozen are on the [[Yoshitsune (TV series)]], broadcast in 2005.\n\nIn Japan, Tomoe Gozen and Nakano Takeko influenced naginata schools and their techniques. Whether formed by men or women, these schools usually revere the Onna-bugeishas. During the annual [[Aizu]] Autumn Festival, a group of young girls wearing [[hakama]] and shiro headbands take part in the procession, commemorating the actions of Nakano and the ''J\u014dshitai'' (''Girls's Army''). Other important examples are [[Yamakawa Futaba]] and [[Niijima Yae]], who become symbols of the struggle for Japanese women's rights. Some of the onna-bugeishas have become symbolic of a city or prefecture, [[Ii Naotora]] and [[Tachibana Ginchiyo]] are often celebrated at [[Hamamatsu]] and [[Yanagawa, Fukuoka|Yanagawa]] festivals respectively. The warrior nun [[Myorin]], is celebrated in the Tsurusaki region of the [[\u014cita (city)|\u014cita city]], [[Tsuruhime|\u014ch\u014dri Tsuruhime]] is the protagonist of various local folklore and festivals on [[\u014cmishima Island, Ehime|\u014cmishima]] island.

These women engaged in battle alongside [[samurai]] men mostly in times of need. They were members of the ''bushi'' ([[samurai]]) class in [[Feudalism|feudal]] Japan and were trained in the use of weapons to protect their household, family, and honour in times of war. Significant [[icons]] such as [[Tomoe Gozen]], [[Nakano Takeko]], and [[H\u014dj\u014d Masako]] are famous examples of onna-bugeisha.\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nLong before the emergence of the renowned [[samurai]] class, Japanese fighters were highly trained to wield a sword and spear. Women learned to use [[naginata]], [[kaiken]], and the art of [[tantojutsu]] in battle. Such training ensured protection in communities that lacked male fighters. One such woman, later known as [[Empress Jing\u016b]] (c. 169\u2013269 AD), used her skills to inspire [[Economy|economic]] and [[Social Change: Journal of the Council for Social Development|social change]]. She was recognized as the onna bugeisha who led an [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|invasion of Korea]] in 200 AD after her husband [[Emperor Ch\u016bai]], the fourteenth emperor of Japan, was slain in battle.<ref name=\"imes.boj.or.jp\">[http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/cm/english_htmls/history_18sub.htm History of Japanese.

Despite controversies surrounding her existence and her accomplishments, she was an example of the onna bugeisha in its entirety. Years after her death, Jing\u016b was able to transcend the socioeconomic structures that were instilled in Japan. In 1881, Empress Jing\u016b became the first woman to be featured on a [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen|Japanese banknote]].

The epic ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' was composed in the early 13th century in order to commemorate the stories of courageous and devoted [[samurai]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCullough|first1=Helen|title=The Tale of the Heike|date=1988|publisher=Standford UP|location=Standford, CA|page=6}}</ref>  Among those was [[Tomoe Gozen]], servant of [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka]] of the [[Minamoto clan]]. She assisted [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka|Yoshinaka]] in defending himself against the forces of his cousin, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], especially during the [[Battle of Awazu]] on February 21, 1184.\n\nIn ''The Tale of the Heike'', written at the beginning of 14th century, she was described:\n{{quote|... especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swords-woman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.<ref name=\"koryu.com\">[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj1.html#Introduction Women Warriors of Japan: Early History]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\nAlthough she was not proven to be a historical figure, Tomoe Gozen has impacted much of the warrior class, including many traditional Naginata schools. Her actions in battle also received much attention in the arts plays such as Tomoe no Monogatari and various [[ukiyo-e]]. As time passed, the influence of onna-bugeisha saw its way from paintings to politics.[[File:Hangaku Gozen by Yoshitoshi.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hangaku Gozen]]]]Another famous female general of the Genpei War was [[Hangaku Gozen]]. While Tomoe Gozen was an ally of the Minamoto clan, Hangaku allied with the Taira clan. The existence of these two prominent female generals confirms that the status of women during this time was still less unequal than future periods. Several other women are supposed to have acted as samurai during this period, but many of them have been omitted from history.\n\nIn ages past, it was more common to see women become reigning empresses, this would change in the future during the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji restoration]]. Throughout Japanese history, women, while not generally becoming ''[[de jure]]'' chiefs of a samurai clan, several ''[[de facto]]'' ruled their clans.\n\nAfter the Heike were thwarted towards the western provinces of Japan, the [[Kamakura shogunate]] (1185\u20131333) was soon established under the rule of Minamoto no Yoritomo. After he passed, his wife, [[H\u014dj\u014d Masako]], acting in the early years of the H\u014dj\u014d regency, became the first onna-bugeisha to be a prominent player in politics. Masako became a [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]], a traditional fate of samurai widows, and continued her involvement in politics, influencing the fates of her sons [[Minamoto no Yoriie]] and [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]], the second and third sh\u014dgun, and of the [[H\u014dj\u014d clan|H\u014dj\u014d]] faction at the sh\u014dguns' court.<ref>[http://www.samurai-archives.com/masako.html H\u014dj\u014d Masako]</ref>\n\nThrough the collective efforts of Masako and a few political puppets, laws governing the sh\u014dgun's court in the early 13th century allowed women equal rights of inheritance with fraternal kin. Even though the primary role of women in ancient Japan continued to be the support to their family and their husbands, they acquired a higher status in the household. These laws also allowed Japanese women to control finances, bequeath property, maintain their homes, manage servants, and raise their children with proper, loyal, samurai upbringing. Japanese women were also expected to defend their homes in times of war.\n[[File:Battle of Awazugahara.jpg|center|thumb|411x411px|[[Tomoe Gozen]] in the [[Battle of Awazu]]]]\n\n=== Sengoku Period ===\n\nDuring the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga Shogunate]], due to tensions between the shogunate [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]], Japan goes to war again. In 1460, when shogun [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] abdicated his position to his younger brother [[Ashikaga Yoshimi]], [[Hino Tomiko]] (Yoshimasa's wife) was strongly against this decision. Tomiko sought political and military support to rule as regent until the birth of her son, she secured the support of [[Yamana S\u014dzen]] and other leaders of powerful samurai clans. Then she went to war against Yoshimasa and his supporters, especially the [[Hosokawa clan]]. This dispute for succession started the [[\u014cnin War]] (1467-1477) and led to the begin of the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&stype=0&dtype=0&dname=0ss&p=%E6%97%A5%E9%87%8E%E5%AF%8C%E5%AD%90|title=Hino Tomiko|work=[[Daijirin]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804061906/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8|archivedate=2009-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:\u5c0f\u677e\u59eb.jpg|left|thumb|303x303px|[[Komatsuhime]], fought in the Siege of Ueda and challenged [[Sanada Masayuki]] and [[Sanada Yukimura]] at the entrance of Numata Castle.]]In the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]] several daimyos took charge of their own affairs and fought against each other by territory, women of noble clans and even peasant women members of [[Ikk\u014d-ikki]], [[Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b|Ikk\u014d-shu]], [[Saika Ikki]] and others Ikki sects went to the battlefields. In 1569, [[Lady Ichikawa|Ichikawa no Tsubone]], the wife of a [[M\u014dri clan|Mori]] family retainer from western Japan. When her husband was absent from the campaign, she assumed responsibility for the defense of Konomine castle with her armed  [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]. Attacks on the yamashiro (the mountaintop castles), the characteristic fortress of the daimyo, have provided many unwanted opportunities for women to engage in defense and suffer the ultimate sacrifice if the castle falls. \n\nWomen participated in battles until the unification of Japan by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In 1591 several women defended [[Kunohe Castle]] even when it was on fire in the [[Kunohe Rebellion]]. After Hideyoshi's death, his concubine [[Yodo-dono]] took over the [[De facto|''De facto'']] leadership of the Toyotomi clan and in 1614 she and her son, [[Toyotomi Hideyori|Hideyori]], led a rebellion against the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. In 1615, when [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] attacked [[Osaka Castle|Osaka castle]] again, Yodo-dono and her son committed suicide in the flames of Osaka castle. Suicide inside a burning castle may have been the last act of loyalty to a samurai-class woman.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Evidence of female participation in battles ====\nDuring the [[Sengoku period]] there are several accounts of women actively on the battlefield, such as the case of [[Myorin]] who inspired the people to fought against 3,000 [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] soldiers, [[Kaihime]] who fought against the [[Toyotomi clan]] in the [[Siege of Oshi]] (1590), [[Onamihime]] who became the representative leader of the [[Nikaid\u014d clan]] and fought in various battles against her nephew [[Date Masamune]]. [[Akai Teruko]], who became famous for fighting until she was 76 years old and became known as <nowiki>''The Strongest Woman in the Warring States Period''</nowiki>. The heroic [[Tsuruhime]], who is said to be the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Joan of Arc of Japan<nowiki>''</nowiki>, is one of the several examples of how the Onna-bugeisha played a crucial role in japanese history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Hojo_Masako_(Takeda_Katsuyori's_wife).jpg|thumb|[[Takeda Katsuyori#Personal life|Hojo Masako]] (Takeda Katsuyori's wife) carrying a naginata in the [[Battle of Tenmokuzan]].]]\nJapanese women were educated to become wives and mothers, although most women knew about politics, martial arts and diplomacy, they were not allowed to succeed clan leadership. However, there were exceptions, [[Ii Naotora]] took over the clan leadership after the death of all men of the Ii family, her efforts as a leader made her clan independent and she became a [[Daimy\u014d]]. There were many noble women with great political influence in their clans, even becoming the ''[[de facto]]'' leader. An acceptable example of women who became known as ''<nowiki>''onna daimyo''</nowiki> (''[[Landlord|female landlord]]) are [[Jukei-ni]] and [[T\u014dsh\u014din|Toshoin]]. Both women acted, for a long period, as rulers of their respective [[Feud|feuds]], even though they were not considered [[heirs]].\n\nIn the 16th century there were units consisting only of women, as was the case of [[Ikeda Sen]] who led 200 women [[musketeer]]s ([[Firearms of Japan|Teppo unit]]) in the [[Battle of Shizugatake]] and [[Battle of Komaki and Nagakute|Battle of Komaki-Nagakute]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAMLAAAAMAAJ&q=%E6%B1%A0%E7%94%B0%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93&dq=%E6%B1%A0%E7%94%B0%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ4ZWc5JTiAhWZJbkGHUkiB5IQ6AEIRTAE|title=\u5099\u524d\u85e9\u5e55\u672b\u7dad\u65b0\u53f2\u8ac7|last=\u8352\u6728\u7950\u81e3|date=1978|publisher=\u65e5\u672c\u6587\u654e\u51fa\u7248|language=ja}}</ref> [[Otazu no kata]] fought alongside 18 armed maids against [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa Ieyasu's]] troops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/946584/353|title=\u6b66\u5bb6\u4e8b\u7d00. \u3000\u4e0a\u5dfb - \u56fd\u7acb\u56fd\u4f1a\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|website=dl.ndl.go.jp|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> [[Ueno Tsuruhime]] led thirty-four women in a suicidal charge against the M\u014dri army.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYyFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=ueno+Tsuruhime&source=bl&ots=n9urpF0l13&sig=ACfU3U0IVdXceonE_be05ciCkm9v7BxlJQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwinjOP7gMjhAhWLEbkGHUQEA4IQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=ueno%20Tsuruhime|title=Women Warriors: An Unexpected History|last=Toler|first=Pamela D.|date=2019-02-26|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807064320|language=en}}</ref> [[Tachibana Ginchiyo]], leader of the Tachibana clan fought with her female troops in the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign|Kyushu Campaign]] (1586) and in the [[Siege of Yanagawa]] (1600) she organized a resistance formed by nuns against the advance of the [[Battle of Sekigahara|Eastern Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.tiki.ne.jp/~shirabe01/bu/onna/tb/gin001.htm|title=\u9ad8\u6a4b\u30fb\u7acb\u82b1\u5bb6\u306e\u5973\u6027|website=ww2.tiki.ne.jp}}</ref>  These warrior women are presumed to be a minority, but recent studies show that women have always been on the battlefield. The samurai women were not unique to the castle's defense, but also traveled with other men to conquer territories. \n\nIn 1580, a woman from the Bessho clan joins a rebellion against Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the [[Siege of Miki]]. Her husband Bessho Yoshichika was one of the leaders of the rebellion and she plays a key role during the siege, allying herself with the Mori clan. The rebellion lasted three years, until [[Bessho Nagaharu]] surrendered the castle to Hideyoshi, Lady Bessho commits suicide shortly after. In 1582, [[Oda Nobunaga]] launched a final attack on the [[Takeda clan]], a series of battles known as the [[Battle of Tenmokuzan]]. [[Oda Nobutada]] (son of Nobunaga) led 50,000 soldiers, against 3,000 allies of the Takeda clan during the [[Takat\u014d Castle|Siege of Takato castle]]. During this battle, it is recorded in the compilation of chronicles from the [[Oda clan]], [[Shinch\u014d k\u014dki]], that a woman from the [[Suwa clan]] defies Nobutada's forces. The fact that these women have no names recorded in history reiterates the argument that many reports of samurai women participating in battles have been omitted and lost over the years.\n[[File:Illustrated Story of Night Attack on Yoshitsune's Residence At Horikawa, 16th Century 2.jpg|left|thumb|269x269px|Women accompanying men in a battle. (16th century illustration).]]\nDuring this era, the existence of female [[Ninja]]s ([[Kunoichi]]) is dated, their training differed from the training given to male ninjas, although they also had a core in common as they trained in [[taijutsu]], [[kenjutsu]], [[ninjutsu]] skills. A historically accepted example is [[Mochizuki Chiyome]], a 16th-century noble descendant who was commissioned by warlord [[Takeda Shingen]] to recruit women to create a secret network of hundreds of spies.<ref>Thomas A. Green, ''Martial Arts of the World'' (2001), p. 671.</ref>\n\nIt is believed that many more women participated in battles than those written in historical records. For example, DNA tests on 105 bodies excavated from the Battle of Senbon Matsubaru between [[Takeda Katsuyori]] and [[H\u014dj\u014d Ujinao|Hojo Ujinao]] in 1580 revealed that 35 of them were women. Other excavations were made in areas where battles took place away from castles. Several female casualties in sieges are common, but according to recent studies show that 30% of the corpses of battles away from castles were women. According to [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]], the details of the excavation confirm the Onna-bugeishas were almost certainly present in the battlefields.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7GHCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=pt-BR#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Samurai Women 1184\u20131877|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|date=2012-01-20|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781780963334|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Edo Period and beyond===\n[[File:nakanotakeko.jpg|thumb|[[Nakano Takeko]] died at the [[Battle of Aizu]].]]\n<!--Comments moved from article space to talk page.-->\nBecause of the influence of [[Edo neo-Confucianism]] (1600\u20131868), the status of the onna-bugeisha diminished significantly. The function of onna-bugeisha changed in addition to their husbands. [[Samurai]] were no longer concerned with battles and war, they were [[bureaucrat]]s. Women, specifically daughters of most upper class households, were soon pawns to dreams of success and power. The roaring ideals of fearless devotion and selflessness were gradually replaced by quiet, passive, civil obedience.\n\nTravel during the Edo period was demanding and unsettling for many female samurai (because of heavy restrictions). They always had to be accompanied by a man, since they were not allowed to travel by themselves. Additionally, they had to possess specific permits, establishing their business and motives. Samurai women also received much harassment from officials who manned inspection checkpoints.\n[[File:Japanese Swordswoman.jpg|left|thumb|221x221px|''[[Kenjutsu]]'' practitioner (Swordswoman) in a duel.]]\nThe onset of the 17th century marked a significant transformation in the social acceptance of women in Japan. Many samurai viewed women purely as child bearers; the concept of a woman being a fit companion for war was no longer conceivable. The relationship between a husband and wife could be correlated to that of a lord and his vassal. \"Husbands and wives did not even customarily sleep together. The husband would visit his wife to initiate any sexual activity and afterwards would retire to his own room\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj2.html#Warring Women Warriors of Japan: The Edo Period, an Enforced Peace]</ref>\n\nAlthough women learned exclusively Naginata handling techniques, some women broke traditionalism and learned different techniques such as ''[[Kenjutsu]].'' [[Sasaki Rui]], [[Hokushin Itt\u014d-ry\u016b#Famous Swordmen|Chiba Sanako]] and [[Nakazawa Koto]] are examples of women who became prominent [[swordsmen|swordswomen]] in Edo period. During this time, female-led ''kenjutsu'' schools become commonplace, although traditionally the leadership of these schools is inherited [[Patrilineality|patrilinely]].\n\nIn 1868, during the [[Battle of Aizu]], a part of the [[Boshin War]], [[Nakano Takeko]], a member of the [[Aizu]] clan, was recruited to become leader of a female corps ''J\u014dshitai'' (\u5a18\u5b50\u968a ''Girls's Army''). who fought against the onslaught of 20,000 soldiers of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] of the [[\u014cgaki Domain]]. Highly skilled at the naginata, Takeko and her corps of about 20 joined 3000 other Aizu samurai in battle. The H\u014dkai-ji in [[Aizubange]], Fukushima province contains a [[monument]] erected in her honor. Less-celebrated but no less remarkable would be the efforts of [[Yamamoto Yaeko]], [[Matsudaira Teru]] and [[Yamakawa Futaba]], who served as fighter defending [[Aizuwakamatsu Castle]] during the [[Battle of Aizu]]. Yaeko would later be one of the first civil leaders for [[women's rights]] in Japan.\n\n== Weapons ==\n[[File:Nakanotakekostatue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Nakano Takeko]] holding a naginata.]]\nThe most popular weapon-of-choice of onna-bugeisha is the [[naginata]], which is a versatile, conventional [[polearm]] with a curved blade at the tip. The weapon is mainly favored for its length, which can compensate for the strength and body size advantage of male opponents.<ref name=\"koryu.com 2\">[http://www.koryu.com/Library/wwj1.html#Introduction Women Warriors of Japan: The Edo Period, an Enforced Peace]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe naginata has a niche between the [[katana]] and the [[yari]], which is rather effective in close quarter [[melee]] when the opponent is kept at bay, and is also relatively efficient against [[cavalry]]. Through its use by many legendary samurai women, the naginata has been propelled as the iconic image of a woman warrior. During the Edo Period, many schools focusing on the use of the naginata were created and perpetuated its association with women.\n\nAdditionally, as most of the time their primary purpose as onna-bugeisha was to safeguard their homes from marauders, emphasis was laid on ranged weapons to be shot from defensive structures.<ref name=\"koryu.com 2\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Girl warriors in 2006 Aizu parade.JPG|thumb|A group of girls celebrating the Women army in Aizu Parade (2006)]]\nThe image of samurai women continues to be impactful in martial arts, [[Historical fiction|historical novels]], [[book]]s and [[popular culture]] in general. Like the kunoichis (female ninja) and [[Geisha]]s, the Onna-bugeisha's conduct is seen as the ideal of a Japanese women in movies, animations and TV series. In western, the Onna-bugeishas gained popularity when the historical documentary ''Samurai Warrior Queens'' aired on the [[Smithsonian Channel]]. Several other channels reprised the documentary. The 56th NHK taiga drama, [[Naotora: The Lady Warlord]] it was the first NHK drama where the female protagonist is the head of a samurai clan. The 52nd [[NHK]] [[taiga drama]], [[Yae no Sakura]] focuses on [[Niijima Yae]], a woman warrior who fought in [[Boshin War]], this drama portrays Nakano Takeko, Matsudaira Teru and others onna-bugeishas. Other taiga dramas portray famous onna-bugeishas, H\u014dj\u014d Masako and Tomoe Gozen are on the [[Yoshitsune (TV series)]], broadcast in 2005.\n\nIn Japan, Tomoe Gozen and Nakano Takeko influenced naginata schools and their techniques. Whether formed by men or women, these schools usually revere the Onna-bugeishas. During the annual [[Aizu]] Autumn Festival, a group of young girls wearing [[hakama]] and shiro headbands take part in the procession, commemorating the actions of Nakano and the ''J\u014dshitai'' (''Girls's Army''). Other important examples are [[Yamakawa Futaba]] and [[Niijima Yae]], who become symbols of the struggle for Japanese women's rights.

The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km<sup>2</sup>). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised.

Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.\n[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]], all which were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref>these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from mainland USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from mainland Alaska, {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.</ref> During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second-most-powerful earthquake]] in recorded history, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]]). The time of day (5:36&nbsp;pm), time of year (spring) and location of the [[epicenter]] were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.\n\n===Discovery of oil===\n\nThe 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\n===Energy===\n\n{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}\n[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.

Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\n\nAlaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|\"Outside\"]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Main|Transportation in Alaska}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Sterling Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Sterling Highway]], near its intersection with the [[Seward Highway]]]]\n\n===Roads===\n\n{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}\n[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]\n[[File:Interstate Routes in Alaska.svg|thumb|[[List of Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]]]]\n\nAlaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.\n[[File:AlaskaSign.jpg|right|thumb|Alaska welcome sign on the [[Klondike Highway]]]]\n\nThe [[Interstate Highways in Alaska]] consists of a total of 1082 miles. One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]].

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.) In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.<ref name=\"RailLink1\">{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail |author=Barbara Yaffe |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219014658/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"RailLink2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622 | title=Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link | author=Allan Dowd | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 | agency=Reuters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713120019/https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-alaska-railway-dc/economic-study-touts-alaska-canada-rail-link-idUSN2138860820070621 | archive-date=July 13, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"RailLink3\">{{cite web|url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |title=Alaska Canada Rail Link |author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=January 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025223/http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].\n\n===Marine transport===\n\nMany cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.\n\n[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]\n\nAlaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula.

The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\n\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.

Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on \"Public Safety Officers\" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.\n\nMany rural communities in Alaska are considered \"dry\", having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/AST/ABI/docs/SDEUreports/2003AnnualReport.pdf |title=Alaska State Troopers Alaska Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Enforcement Control Board |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230011202/http://www.dps.state.ak.us/AST/ABI/docs/SDEUreports/2003AnnualReport.pdf |archive-date=December 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Hss.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925085430/http://hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic abuse]] and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/09/30/1480089/survey-finds-high-rates-of-sexual.html |title=Survey reveals higher rate of violence against Alaska women |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105355/http://www.adn.com/2010/09/30/1480089/survey-finds-high-rates-of-sexual.html |archivedate=May 31, 2014 }}</ref> Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas.

The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\n\nThe official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is \"[[Alaska's Flag]]\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].\n\n===Alaska in film and on television===\n\n{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}\n[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]\n\nAlaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]].

The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.\n\nMany films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]].

The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km<sup>2</sup>). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\n[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]\n\nBetween 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\n[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\nOn March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the President of the United States. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.\n\n[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\nFor most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.

Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.\n[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]], all which were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref>these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from mainland USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from mainland Alaska, {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.</ref> During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides.

The time of day (5:36&nbsp;pm), time of year (spring) and location of the [[epicenter]] were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.\n\n===Discovery of oil===\n\nThe 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector.

The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\").

Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs.

The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.

An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\n\nAlaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|\"Outside\"]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Main|Transportation in Alaska}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Sterling Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Sterling Highway]], near its intersection with the [[Seward Highway]]]]\n\n===Roads===\n\n{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}\n[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]\n[[File:Interstate Routes in Alaska.svg|thumb|[[List of Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]]]]\n\nAlaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada.

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.)

However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].\n\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization\u2014state/county/township\u2014most of Alaska uses only two tiers\u2014state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Mim|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=35SwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=Fairbanks+has+a+separate+borough+(the+Fairbanks+North+Star+Borough)+and+municipality+(the+City+of+Fairbanks)&source=bl&ots=BCgI8dcgDn&sig=ACfU3U0hPQLgZ3797_mEAj69IywLKbkzkw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO5OG1o4boAhWEZxUIHRZABzMQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Fairbanks%20has%20a%20separate%20borough%20(the%20Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough)%20and%20municipality%20(the%20City%20of%20Fairbanks)&f=false|title=What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects of the Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline on the Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska|date=September 18, 2019|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-01076-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian.

The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Man]].\n\nThere are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the [[Alaska Folk Festival]], the [[Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival]], the Anchorage Folk Festival, the [[Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival]], the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\n\nThe official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is \"[[Alaska's Flag]]\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].\n\n===Alaska in film and on television===\n\n{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}\n[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]\n\nAlaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]].

The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.\n\nMany films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]].

When the garrison on the tiny [[Arwad|Isle of Ruad]] fell, it marked the loss of the last [[Crusades|Crusader]] outpost on the coast of the [[Levant]]. In 1291, the Crusaders had lost their main power base at the coastal city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre]], and the Muslim Mamluks had been systematically destroying any remaining Crusader ports and fortresses since then, forcing the Crusaders to relocate their dwindling [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to the island of [[Cyprus]]. In 1299\u20131300, the Cypriots sought to retake the Syrian port city of [[Tartus|Tortosa]], by setting up a staging area on Ruad, two miles (3&nbsp;km) off the coast of Tortosa. The plans were to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|coordinate an offensive]] between the forces of the Crusaders, and those of the [[Ilkhanate]] (Mongol Persia). However, though the Crusaders successfully established a bridgehead on the island, the Mongols did not arrive, and the Crusaders were forced to withdraw the bulk of their forces to Cyprus. The [[Knights Templar]] set up a permanent garrison on the island in 1300, but the Mamluks besieged and captured Ruad in 1302. With the loss of the island, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the [[Holy Land]]. Attempts at other Crusades continued for centuries, but the Europeans were never again able to occupy any territory in the Holy Land until the 20th century, during the events of [[World War I]].<ref>Demurger, chapter \"The Isle of Ruad\", in ''The Last Templar''.</ref><ref>Tyerman, p. 771</ref>\n\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Mongol raids into Syria and Palestine ca 1300.svg|right|thumb|Mongol advances, 1299\u20131303.

When the garrison on the tiny [[Arwad|Isle of Ruad]] fell, it marked the loss of the last [[Crusades|Crusader]] outpost on the coast of the [[Levant]]. In 1291, the Crusaders had lost their main power base at the coastal city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre]], and the Muslim Mamluks had been systematically destroying any remaining Crusader ports and fortresses since then, forcing the Crusaders to relocate their dwindling [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to the island of [[Cyprus]]. In 1299\u20131300, the Cypriots sought to retake the Syrian port city of [[Tartus|Tortosa]], by setting up a staging area on Ruad, two miles (3&nbsp;km) off the coast of Tortosa. The plans were to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|coordinate an offensive]] between the forces of the Crusaders, and those of the [[Ilkhanate]] (Mongol Persia). However, though the Crusaders successfully established a bridgehead on the island, the Mongols did not arrive, and the Crusaders were forced to withdraw the bulk of their forces to Cyprus. The [[Knights Templar]] set up a permanent garrison on the island in 1300, but the Mamluks besieged and captured Ruad in 1302. With the loss of the island, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the [[Holy Land]]. Attempts at other Crusades continued for centuries, but the Europeans were never again able to occupy any territory in the Holy Land until the 20th century, during the events of [[World War I]].<ref>Demurger, chapter \"The Isle of Ruad\", in ''The Last Templar''.</ref><ref>Tyerman, p. 771</ref>\n\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Mongol raids into Syria and Palestine ca 1300.svg|right|thumb|Mongol advances, 1299\u20131303.

In 1284, he was supporting the claim of the [[Infantes de la Cerda]] (although his allegiance would shift various times) and along with them, he had forged an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and the [[Kingdom of France]], the alliance stipulated in the [[Treaty of \u00c1greda (1281)|Treaty of \u00c1greda]] of 1281.\n\nIn an effort to strike at Juan I N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara, Sancho IV made a deal with the Kingdom of Aragon which ceded sovereignty over the [[Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Albarrac\u00edn]], which had up until then been a part of the [[Kingdom of Castile]], to [[Peter III of Aragon]] upon its capture by either Castilian or Aragonese forces.<ref>Carlos Ayala Mart\u00ednez, [http://revistas.ucm.es/ghi/02143038/articulos/ELEM8686120151A.PDF Paces castellano-aragonesas de Campillo-\u00c1greda (1281)]</ref> Prior to his support of the de la Cerda claims to the throne, Juan I N\u00fa\u00f1ez of Lara was a subject of the Castilian crown.\n\nShortly after the [[:es:Desaf\u00edo de Burdeos|Desaf\u00edo de Burdeos]], Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez I ambushed [[Peter III of Aragon]] with the goal of taking him prisoner back to France to be presented to [[Philip III of France]]. In June 1283, Peter III was in the area of [[Tarazona]] conducting attack on Navarre and Arag\u00f3n in which he conquered and sacked various towns, the [[Castillo de Ull]] amongst them.\n\n==The battle==\nIn winter of 1283, whilst [[Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez I de Lara]] was in [[Trevi\u00f1o]] raising Navarese reinforcements to defend his city from the Aragonese who had by then declared war against him, he was besieged by Peter III of Aragon at [[Albarrac\u00edn]] with only around 200 knights.<ref name=Castan/>\n\nFrom April until September 1284, the besieging forces built their camp in the streets of the town of [[Albarrac\u00edn]] (literally on ''Calle de los Palacios'') for their soldiers to remain under cover and in comfort with stores and housing for the winter. On 29 September 1284, after many months of siege, the city surrendered and was occupied by troops of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The Aragonese king, upon capturing the city, gave it as a gift to his illegitimate child with In\u00e9s Zapata, Ferdinand of Aragon.<ref>{{cite book | last = de Salazar | first = Luis | authorlink = Luis de Salazar y Castro | editor = Mateo de Llanos y Guzm\u00e1n | volume = volume 3 | title = Historia geneal\u00f3gica de la Casa de Lara | url = http://www.memoriadigitalvasca.es/handle/10357/302 | edition = | year = 1697 | location = Madrid | isbn = | pages = 134\u2013135 | chapter = VIII | urlcap\u00edtulo = | cita =}}</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nAlthough [[Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez II de Lara]], son of the defeated Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez I attempted various times to retake his ancestral property of Albarrac\u00edn back from the Aragonese, the city eventually passed to the Aragonese Crown.<ref name=Castan>Jos\u00e9 Luis Cast\u00e1n Esteban, ''[http://iesalbar.educa.aragon.es/publicacioes/divulgaci%F3n/Historia%20del%20Se%F1or%EDo%20de%20Albarrac%EDn.pdf Historia del Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Albarrac\u00edn]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan I N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara]]\n* [[Peter III of Aragon]]\n* [[Sancho IV of Castile]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book\n| last = Gonz\u00e1lez Jim\u00e9nez\n| first = Manuel\n| author-link =\n| publisher = Editorial Ariel S.
