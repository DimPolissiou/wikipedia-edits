The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news|author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

First the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Secondly the specialised nature of care of the critically ill, and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of PPE.  Thirdly the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff, and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news|author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.
