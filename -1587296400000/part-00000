He gained admission and studied Political Economics at [[London Guildhall University]] (renovated).\n\n==Activism==\n===Awareness===\nOn 5 September 2015, Nnamdi Kanu was a guest speaker at the World Igbo Congress which was held in Los Angeles, where he told his audience \"we need guns and we need bullets\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Egbejule |first1=Eromo |last2=Anyadike |first2=Obi |date=16 December 2016  |title=Nigeria fails to come to grips with separatist 'New Biafra' |url=https://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2016/12/16/nigeria-fails-come-grips-separatist-%E2%80%9Cnew-biafra%E2%80%9D |agency=[[IRIN]] |access-date=22 August 2017 }}</ref> In an interview in June 2017, Kanu explained his comment saying that he demanded for bullets and guns from a group of US-based Nigerians for self-defense against the incessant [[Herder\u2013farmer conflicts in Nigeria|attacks]] on Igbos by [[Fulani herdsmen]] which were currently reoccurring in Biafra lands.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chijioke |first=Jannah  |date=27 June 2017 |title=Biafra: Why I asked for guns from US-based Nigerians \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu |url=http://dailypost.ng/2017/06/27/biafra-asked-guns-us-based-nigerians-nnamdi-kanu-video/ |newspaper=[[Daily Post (Nigeria)|Daily Post]] |access-date=22 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil disobedience===\nNnamdi Kanu's pronounced strategy has been the application of civil disobedience in pressing home his demand for the freedom of his people. In various air broadcasts,  Nnamdi Kanu stated how his adoption of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s forms of civil disobedience will lead to the \"restoration of Biafra\". In an interview granted to [[Newsweek]], Nnamdi Kanu opined his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, \"I hope that what we are looking for can be accomplished peacefully. I am an advocate of passive resistance. Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\"\n\nPrior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \"signed, sealed and delivered\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others.\n\n==Imprisonment==\n===Arrest===\nOn 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in

In various air broadcasts,  Nnamdi Kanu stated how his adoption of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s forms of civil disobedience will lead to the \"restoration of Biafra\". In an interview granted to [[Newsweek]], Nnamdi Kanu opined his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, \"I hope that what we are looking for can be accomplished peacefully. I am an advocate of passive resistance. Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\"\n\nPrior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \"signed, sealed and delivered\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others.\n\n==Imprisonment==\n===Arrest===\nOn 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in

These teams operate in conjunction with one another to get the dogs shipped out of Puerto Rico and to different states in the U.S.<ref name=\"TL\" /><ref name=\"nyt\" /><ref name=\"earthquakes\" />\n\nThe process of helping these animals begins with them being logged and identified on the beach. Once logged, the Beach Coordinator will check in on these dogs, and give them food and medicine, each day, until space opens up in the Sato Project shelter. Once a dog is taken to the shelter it receives a full [[check-up]]: A [[veterinarian]] determines what, if any, medications or care is required for that animal to return to full health. In addition to a check-up, the dogs are spayed/neutered and [[vaccinate]]d. When the dog is finally well enough to travel, volunteers in Puerto Rico help prepare it to fly to either [[JFK Airport|JFK]] in New York or [[Newark Airport]] in New Jersey. Upon arriving, the dogs are received by another team of volunteers who transport them to the project's adoption team.
