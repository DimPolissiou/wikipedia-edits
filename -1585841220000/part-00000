Whereas the first season was serious and subdued with tiny bursts of action and comedy, the second season was all flash and fun. To fit this motif, John Woo and Joe Carnahan were hired to direct ''Hostage'' and ''Ticker'', respectively. The other main difference was that, instead of showcasing several different BMW cars (like the first season had done), the only car showcased was the then-new [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 Roadster]].<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\nTo celebrate the premiere of the second season, BMW threw a party at the [[ArcLight Hollywood]] on October 17, 2002, just a week before the film's internet debut.

After he is told that he holds the life of a person in his hand, he is ordered to burn the money. As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head without revealing where the woman is hidden.

During the attack the briefcase is struck by a bullet, causing a display on it to begin counting down, and it to leak an unknown grey fluid from the bullet hole. The Driver manages to cause the helicopter to crash, but refuses to proceed without knowing the contents of the damaged briefcase. It is revealed that the man guards a human heart for transplant to a [[Politician|statesman]] (shown in military uniform), whose life and [[peacemaking]] is needed for the continued freedom of the country's people. The case is delivered by the Driver in time for the surgery. Also present are another military officer whom the passenger had said would take over the country with tyranny if his superior died (and whose uniform matches the soldiers who had tried to intercept the heart), and US agents who ensure that he does not interfere with the surgery, and so is forced to give up his attempt to take the country by force. \n* Starring [[Don Cheadle]] and [[F.

He is worried about his ageing and the fact he can no longer do his moves like [[the splits]], and says his lessened ability to perform means he cannot maintain his fame and fortune. He proposes a new wager, for the stakes of the Driver's soul against another 50 years for his career, betting on the Driver [[drag racing]] against the Devil's doorman/driver Bob on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] at dawn. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass around a train while the Devil's car (a flamed [[Pontiac Firebird]]) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again, who then does a [[Handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] into the splits.

The Driver is hired to transport the package with Holt \"babysitting\" him, ordering the hired driver to evade the FBI forces.

A disgruntled employee has kidnapped a CEO and has hidden her, demanding $5,088,042. The Driver delivers the money, writing the sum on his hand as instructed by the hostage taker. After he is told that he holds the life of a person in his hand, he is ordered to burn the money. As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head without revealing where the woman is hidden. The Driver then tries to find the hostage before she drowns in the trunk of a sinking car. As a twist, the kidnapped woman is revealed to be the hostage taker's lover. She coldly taunts the dying man in the hospital.\n* Starring [[Maury Chaykin]] and [[Kathryn Morris]]\n* Directed by [[John Woo]]\n* Written by David Carter, [[Greg Hahn]] and Vincent Ngo\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n====''Ticker''====\nIn an unnamed foreign country, the Driver drives a wounded man who carries a mysterious briefcase, while under helicopter attack. During the attack the briefcase is struck by a bullet, causing a display on it to begin counting down, and it to leak an unknown grey fluid from the bullet hole. The Driver manages to cause the helicopter to crash, but refuses to proceed without knowing the contents of the damaged briefcase. It is revealed that the man guards a human heart for transplant to a [[Politician|statesman]] (shown in military uniform), whose life and [[peacemaking]] is needed for the continued freedom of the country's people. The case is delivered by the Driver in time for the surgery. Also present are another military officer whom the passenger had said would take over the country with tyranny if his superior died (and whose uniform matches the soldiers who had tried to intercept the heart), and US agents who ensure that he does not interfere with the surgery, and so is forced to give up his attempt to take the country by force. \n* Starring [[Don Cheadle]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]]\n* cameos by [[Ray Liotta]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Clifton Powell]] and [[Dennis Haysbert]] as US agents\n* Written and directed by [[Joe Carnahan]]\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n====''Beat the Devil''====\nThe Driver is employed by [[James Brown]], who goes to meet the [[Devil]] to re-negotiate the deal he made as a young man in 1954 to [[deal with the Devil|trade his soul]] for fame and fortune. He is worried about his ageing and the fact he can no longer do his moves like [[the splits]], and says his lessened ability to perform means he cannot maintain his fame and fortune. He proposes a new wager, for the stakes of the Driver's soul against another 50 years for his career, betting on the Driver [[drag racing]] against the Devil's doorman/driver Bob on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] at dawn. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass around a train while the Devil's car (a flamed [[Pontiac Firebird]]) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again, who then does a [[Handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] into the splits. The final scene shows [[Marilyn Manson]] who lives down the hall from the Devil, complaining that the noise is disturbing his [[Bible]] reading. \n* Starring [[James Brown]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Danny Trejo]]\n* cameo by [[Marilyn Manson]]\n* Directed by [[Tony Scott]]\n* Written by David Carter, Greg Hahn and Vincent Ngo\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n===\"The Subplot Films\"===\nFour smaller movies, dubbed \"The Subplot Movies\" were shot and directed by [[Ben Younger]]. Lacking any real style (and appearing to be shot with a standard consumer-level DV-cam), they were designed to \"fill in the gaps\" between the five films and featured a man who appeared to be tracking the Driver, finding \"clues\" usually scribbled, in pen, on small pieces of paper. The films, at first glance, have no real connection to the Driver movies at all and made no real sense \u2013 they contained \"clues\" that were part of an [[alternate reality game]] that would lead intuitive fans to a party in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n===Season 3===\n\n====''The Escape''====\n{{main|The Escape (2016 film)}}\nAfter the disappearance of geneticist Dr. Nora Phillips and the exposure of the Molecular Genetics company's illegal activities in human cloning, the FBI raids the facility to arrest its key people. One surviving specimen, Lily, is escorted by a ruthless mercenary and gunman named Holt to be delivered to an unnamed customer, who bought the specimen. The Driver is hired to transport the package with Holt \"babysitting\" him, ordering the hired driver to evade the FBI forces. At the end, when the Driver realizes that Lily has human feelings, he forces Holt to get out of the car and drives the girl to a harbor where Dr. Phillips becomes the unnamed customer and takes proper care of her creation.\n* Starring [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Dakota Fanning]], and [[Vera Farmiga]]\n* Directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]]\n* Written by Neill Blomkamp and David Carter\n* Featured the [[BMW 5 Series (G30)]]\n\n==Contest/game & party==\nShortly after the release of the \"Subplot Films\", reports circulated around the Internet that Apple, Starbucks, BMW Films First Illinois Mortgage, and Susstones' all had a small, hidden link on their website that had a direct connection with the movies. Upon further investigation, three phone numbers and a web address were found in the four films, which led many viewers to call those numbers and go to that website.\n\nThousands took to the web, taking place in the hunt but only 250 solved the puzzle, which allowed the lucky few to be entered in a drawing to win a 2003 BMW Z4, seen in ''Hostage''.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was a voicemail, instructing participants to meet with a correspondent in Las Vegas, the site of a VIP Party for BMW where the Grand Prize Z4 was given away to a couple from [[Bellingham, Washington]].<ref>[http://www.unfiction.com/compendium/2003/01/12/uncapping-the-ride-bmw-endgame-gives-hope/ compendium archive \u00bb Uncapping the Ride \u2013 BMW Endgame Gives Hope]. unfiction.com (January 12, 2003).

He is the recipient of two [[National Film Awards]] and four [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2019, he was given India's fourth-highest civilian honor [[Padma Shri]] for his contributions to art.\n\nBorn in [[Belwa]], a small village in Narkatiaganj, Bihar, Bajpayee aspired to become an actor since childhood. He relocated to Delhi at the age of seventeen, and applied for the [[National School of Drama]], only to be rejected four times. He continued to do theatre while studying in college. Bajpayee made his feature film debut with a one-minute role in ''[[Drohkaal]]'' (1994), and a minor role of a dacoit in [[Shekhar Kapur]]'s ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994). After a few unnoticed roles, he played the gangster Bhiku Mhatre in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s 1998 crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'', which proved to be a breakthrough. Bajpayee received the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for the film. He then acted in films such as ''[[Kaun (film)|Kaun]]'' (1999) and ''[[Shool]]'' (1999). For the latter, he won his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bajpayee further played a prince with two wives in ''[[Zubeidaa]]'' (2001), a serial killer in ''[[Aks (2001 film)|Aks]]'' (2001) and a hitchhiker-turned-psychopath killer in ''[[Road (film)|Road]]'' (2002).\n\nBajpayee won the [[National Film Award \u2013 Special Jury Award (Feature Film)|Special Jury National Award]] for ''[[Pinjar (film)|Pinjar]]'' (2003). This was followed by a series of brief, unnoticed roles in films that failed to propel his career forward. He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010), which was well-received. In 2012, Bajpayee played Sardar Khan in ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 1|Gangs of Wasseypur]]''. His next roles were of a [[naxalite]] in ''[[Chakravyuh (2012 film)|Chakravyuh]]'' (2012), and a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI officer]] in ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor [[Ramchandra Siras]], in [[Hansal Mehta]]'s biographical drama ''[[Aligarh (film)|Aligarh]]'', for which he won his third [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] and the Best Actor Award at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]] in 2016.\n\n==Early life ==\n[[File:Neha-Manoj-Bajpai.jpg|thumb|right|Bajpayee with his wife Neha at the ''[[Raajneeti]]'' premiere, 2010]]\nBajpayee was born on 23 April 1969 in a small village called Belwa near the town [[Narkatiaganj]] in [[West Champaran]], [[Bihar]].<ref name=\"koimoi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koimoi.com/actor/manoj-bajpai/|title=Manoj Bajpai's Biography|publisher=[[Koimoi]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002042715/http://www.koimoi.com/actor/manoj-bajpai/|archivedate=2 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He is the second child among his five other siblings, and was named after actor [[Manoj Kumar]].<ref name=\"suicide\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/I-wanted-to-commit-suicide-after-I-was-rejected-by-NSD-Manoj-Bajpayee/articleshow/18399539.cms?referral=PM|title=I wanted to commit suicide after I was rejected by NSD: Manoj Bajpayee|last=Gupta|first=Priya|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=9 February 2013|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131144520/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/I-wanted-to-commit-suicide-after-I-was-rejected-by-NSD-Manoj-Bajpayee/articleshow/18399539.cms?referral=PM|archivedate=31 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"indie\">{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ul0O5gNwKGArQhedU17b7J/Manoj-Bajpayee-The-original-indie-star.html|title=Manoj Bajpayee: The original indie star|last=Bhatia|first=Uday|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|date=7 December 2015|accessdate=8 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233123/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ul0O5gNwKGArQhedU17b7J/Manoj-Bajpayee-The-original-indie-star.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> One of his younger sisters Poonam Dubey, is a fashion designer in the film industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/brother-manoj-bajpayee-pushed-me-into-designing-poonam-dubey-113101200383_1.html|title=Brother Manoj Bajpayee pushed me into designing: Poonam Dubey|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=12 October 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211061336/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/brother-manoj-bajpayee-pushed-me-into-designing-poonam-dubey-113101200383_1.html|archivedate=11 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His father was a farmer and his mother was a housewife.

He is the recipient of two [[National Film Awards]] and four [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2019, he was given India's fourth-highest civilian honor [[Padma Shri]] for his contributions to art.\n\nBorn in [[Belwa]], a small village in Narkatiaganj, Bihar, Bajpayee aspired to become an actor since childhood. He relocated to Delhi at the age of seventeen, and applied for the [[National School of Drama]], only to be rejected four times. He continued to do theatre while studying in college. Bajpayee made his feature film debut with a one-minute role in ''[[Drohkaal]]'' (1994), and a minor role of a dacoit in [[Shekhar Kapur]]'s ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994). After a few unnoticed roles, he played the gangster Bhiku Mhatre in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s 1998 crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'', which proved to be a breakthrough. Bajpayee received the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for the film. He then acted in films such as ''[[Kaun (film)|Kaun]]'' (1999) and ''[[Shool]]'' (1999). For the latter, he won his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bajpayee further played a prince with two wives in ''[[Zubeidaa]]'' (2001), a serial killer in ''[[Aks (2001 film)|Aks]]'' (2001) and a hitchhiker-turned-psychopath killer in ''[[Road (film)|Road]]'' (2002).\n\nBajpayee won the [[National Film Award \u2013 Special Jury Award (Feature Film)|Special Jury National Award]] for ''[[Pinjar (film)|Pinjar]]'' (2003). This was followed by a series of brief, unnoticed roles in films that failed to propel his career forward. He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010), which was well-received. In 2012, Bajpayee played Sardar Khan in ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 1|Gangs of Wasseypur]]''. His next roles were of a [[naxalite]] in ''[[Chakravyuh (2012 film)|Chakravyuh]]'' (2012), and a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI officer]] in ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor [[Ramchandra Siras]], in [[Hansal Mehta]]'s biographical drama ''[[Aligarh (film)|Aligarh]]'', for which he won his third [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] and the Best Actor Award at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]] in 2016.\n\n==Early life ==\n[[File:Neha-Manoj-Bajpai.jpg|thumb|right|Bajpayee with his wife Neha at the ''[[Raajneeti]]'' premiere, 2010]]\nBajpayee was born on 23 April 1969 in a small village called Belwa near the town [[Narkatiaganj]] in [[West Champaran]], [[Bihar]].<ref name=\"koimoi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koimoi.com/actor/manoj-bajpai/|title=Manoj Bajpai's Biography|publisher=[[Koimoi]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002042715/http://www.koimoi.com/actor/manoj-bajpai/|archivedate=2 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He is the second child among his five other siblings, and was named after actor [[Manoj Kumar]].<ref name=\"suicide\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/I-wanted-to-commit-suicide-after-I-was-rejected-by-NSD-Manoj-Bajpayee/articleshow/18399539.cms?referral=PM|title=I wanted to commit suicide after I was rejected by NSD: Manoj Bajpayee|last=Gupta|first=Priya|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=9 February 2013|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131144520/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/I-wanted-to-commit-suicide-after-I-was-rejected-by-NSD-Manoj-Bajpayee/articleshow/18399539.cms?referral=PM|archivedate=31 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"indie\">{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ul0O5gNwKGArQhedU17b7J/Manoj-Bajpayee-The-original-indie-star.html|title=Manoj Bajpayee: The original indie star|last=Bhatia|first=Uday|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|date=7 December 2015|accessdate=8 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233123/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ul0O5gNwKGArQhedU17b7J/Manoj-Bajpayee-The-original-indie-star.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> One of his younger sisters Poonam Dubey, is a fashion designer in the film industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/brother-manoj-bajpayee-pushed-me-into-designing-poonam-dubey-113101200383_1.html|title=Brother Manoj Bajpayee pushed me into designing: Poonam Dubey|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=12 October 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211061336/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/brother-manoj-bajpayee-pushed-me-into-designing-poonam-dubey-113101200383_1.html|archivedate=11 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His father was a farmer and his mother was a housewife.
