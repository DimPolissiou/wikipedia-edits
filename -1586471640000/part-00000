Yet it did not begin without a struggle, as cartoonist Mike Lynch described in a 2005 lecture:\n:After a stint drawing sports cartoons under [[Tad Dorgan|T.A. \"Tad\" Dorgan]] (If you look at Walter Berndt's signature, you can see he draws his \"T\" just like Tad did), he took over the ''And the Fun Begins'' panel from [[Milt Gross]]. By 1920 Berndt had left the ''[[The New York Journal|Journal]]'' to start his own strip. The strip lasted a year. Then he worked at the ''[[New York World]]''. But, within weeks, he was fired for insubordination. (I tried to find out more about this, but this is all I know.) Berndt was out of work and broke. So, with zany cartoonist timing, he got married! And then he began making the rounds with a new strip titled ''Billy the Office Boy''. It was 1922. The World Series was on. Big news, and so no one could get near the editors. Berndt couldn't get in to see anyone. Segar said there wasn't a World Series in Chicago and suggested he send the proposal to [[Joseph Medill Patterson|Captain Patterson]]. So Berndt mailed the strip to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Patterson, opening a phone book for reference, renamed it ''Smitty'' and bought it at Berndt's high asking price.

('''MIRI'''), formerly the '''Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence''' ('''SIAI'''), is a [[non-profit organization]] focused since 2005 on identifying and managing potential [[existential

MIRI's work has focused on a [[friendly artificial intelligence|friendly AI]] approach to system design and on predicting the rate of technology development.\n\n==History==\nIn 2000, [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] founded the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence with funding from Brian and Sabine Atkins, with the purpose of accelerating the development of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref name=FLI2015>{{cite news |title=MIRI: Artificial Intelligence: The Danger of Good Intentions - Future of Life Institute |url=https://futureoflife.org/2015/10/11/113/ |work=Future of Life Institute |date=11 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=NYER/><ref name=\"Waters\"/> However, Yudkowsky began to be concerned that AI systems developed in the future could become [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] and pose risks to humanity,<ref name=FLI2015/> and in 2005 the institute moved to Silicon Valley and began to focus on ways to identify and manage those risks, which were at the time largely ignored by scientists in the field.<ref name=NYER>{{cite news |last1=Khatchadourian |first1=Raffi |title=The Doomsday Invention |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> \n\nStarting in 2006, the Institute organized the [[Singularity Summit]] to discuss the future of AI including its risks, initially in cooperation with Stanford University and with funding from [[Peter Thiel]].

According to rankings in ''Rugby Magazine'', Miami is amongst the top five clubs in the [[Southeastern United States]]. They have regularly won the Florida State Championship. Miami Rugby traces its origin to 1969 when it was founded by Keith Cooksy<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Rugby: Exercise And Competition|last=Levy|first=Linda|date=10 Oct 1980|work=The Hurricane|access-date=|page=10}}</ref> and Reverend John Howells, the Anglican priest at the [[University of Miami]], who wanted to provide visiting [[British Royal Navy]] ships and teams in the Bahamas with competitive rugby.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Rugby Comes To Miami As Teams Start Forming|last=|first=|date=10 Feb 1970|work=The Hurricane|access-date=|page=10}}</ref> Miami Rugby competes in the [[USA Rugby South]] against clubs from [[Florida]], as well as touring African, Argentine, British, French, German, Uruguayan, and West Indies Clubs. Miami Rugby has also toured the Americas.\n\nMiami Rugby players come from all over the globe. Players from Miami Rugby have captained the United States Eagles and represented the Eastern Rugby Union, USA Rugby-South as well as Florida on select side (all-star) teams. Miami Rugby players and \u201cOld Boys\u201d also lend coaching assistance to local universities such as [[University of Miami Rugby Football|University of Miami]] and [http://www.fiurugby.com/index.htm Florida International University]. Miami RFC competes in the Premier Division within the [[Florida Rugby Union]] and nationally in USA Rugby's Division II. As recently as 2008, Miami Rugby was ranked 19th in the nation by [[USA Rugby]] after winning a Florida State Championship. The club started a youth division in 2009. <br/>\n==Honors==\n*'''[[Florida Rugby Union]] Division 1 titles:''' 14'''+''' \n**1972, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1979-1980, 1980-1981, 1981-1982, 1982-1983<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=|title=Surprise Defeat Lets UM Team Go For Rugby Title|last=Healy|first=James|date=23 Feb 1984|work=The Miami Herald|access-date=|page=25}}</ref>, 1983-1984<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=|title=UM Rugby Club Defends State Title Against Florida|last=|first=|date=1 Mar 1984|work=The Miami Herald|access-date=|page=18}}</ref>, 1986-1987<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=|title=Miami Wins Rugby Title|last=|first=|date=2 Mar 1987|work=The Miami Herald|access-date=|page=7D}}</ref>, 1994-1995, 1996, 2007-2008<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-succeeds-in-one-sport-rugby-6520884|title=Miami Succeeds in One Sport, Rugby|last=Lapan|first=Tovin|date=21 Feb 2008|work=Miami New Times|access-date=}}</ref>, 2010<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/scrum-bags-6370060|title=Scrum Bags|last=McCorquodale|first=Amanda|date=1 Apr 2010|work=Miami New Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n**1991<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=|title=Miami Rugby Club Loses State Final|last=|first=|date=21 Oct 1991|work=The Miami Herald|access-date=|page=11D}}</ref>, 2nd Place\n**2007, Plate Champion\n*'''[[Florida Rugby Union]] Division 2* titles:''' 2'''+''' \n**1981, [http://www.rugbyfl.com/Content/Articles/Article.asp?Article_ID=111&User_ID=4928&ArtCat_ID=2 2013-2014]\n*'''[[Florida Rugby Union]] Sevens Championship Series titles:''' '''1+'''\n**2013, 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djcoilrugby.com/2016/07/22/charlotte-hosts-south-conference-rugby-7s-championships/|title=Charlotte Hosts South Conference Rugby 7s Championships|last=Coil|first=Doug|date=22 Jul 2016|website=djcoilrugby}}</ref>\n\n*'''Florida Cup'''\n**1972, 1976, 1980, 1982, 1983, 2004, Champions\n**1973, 1974, 1975, 1978, 2nd Place\n*'''Beerfoot Beach 7s'''\n**2005, Champions\n*'''Daytona Beach 7s'''\n**2013, Champions\n*'''Fort Lauderdale Ruggerfest -

Steam methane reforming (SMR) and autothermal reformer (ATR) are two industrial examples of the primary and secondary reformers, respectively. On the other hand, the process of combined reforming utilizes both of primary and secondary tools for production of synthesis gas, as it is commonly practiced in ammonia manufacturing. For the case of methanol, ATR is fed with nearly pure oxygen (99.5%) rather than air since the presence of excessive N<sub>2</sub> in the syngas would overburden compression and retard the methanol production. The ATR reformer consists of a partial oxidation (POX) chamber (usually non-catalytic medium) and a fixed bed catalytic section. The catalytic fixed bed not only adjusts the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio, but also destroys any probable soot and precursor (e.g. ethylene and acetylene) that may be formed in the POX chamber. Natural gas (NG) is partially oxidized in the combustion chamber by oxygen or air (as an oxidant). Steam to carbon (S/C) ratio that is usually 0.6 in the oxygen-based case has been commercialized by Haldor-Topose Company.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2010.02.021 |title=Arrangement of primary and secondary reformers for synthesis gas production |journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design |volume=88 |issue=10 |pages=1342\u20131350 |year=2010 |last1=Ebrahimi |first1=Hadi |last2=Behroozsarand |first2=Alireza |last3=Zamaniyan |first3=Akbar }}</ref>\n\n== Autothermal reforming ==\nAutothermal reforming (ATR) uses oxygen and carbon dioxide or steam in a reaction with methane to form [[syngas]]. The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic due to the oxidation. When the ATR uses carbon dioxide the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio produced is 1:1; when the ATR uses steam the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio produced is 2.5:1\n\nThe reactions can be described in the following equations, using CO<sub>2</sub>:\n: 2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   3 H<sub>2</sub> + 3 CO + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nAnd using steam:\n: 4 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 10 H<sub>2</sub> + 4 CO\n\nThe outlet temperature of the syngas is between 950-1100 \u00b0C and outlet pressure can be as high as 100 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].<ref>[http://www.topsoe.com/business_areas/methanol/Processes/AutothermalReforming.aspx Topsoe ATR]</ref>\n\nThe main difference between SMR and ATR is that SMR only uses air for combustion as a heat source to create steam, while ATR uses purified oxygen. The advantage of ATR is that the H<sub>2</sub>:CO can be varied, which can be useful for producing specialty products.  For example the production of [[dimethyl ether]] requires a 1:1 H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio.\n\nAlthough more costly to construct, SMR facilities produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than ATR facilities.<ref>[http://www.assemblymag.com/CDA/Archives/edabe122ce5c9010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ AIA: Software Analyzes Cost of Hydrogen Production - Archives - ASSEMBLY<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Partial oxidation ==\n{{main|Partial oxidation}}\nPartial oxidation (POX) occurs when a substoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich syngas.  Being exothermic , POX is, typically, much faster than steam reforming and requires a smaller reactor vessel. As can be seen in chemical reactions of partial oxidation, this process initially produces less hydrogen per unit of the input fuel than is obtained by steam reforming of the same fuel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming |title = Hydrogen Production: Natural Gas Reforming}}</ref>\nNevertheless, tendency to soot formation and relatively low hydrogen production yield are among the major drawbacks of this method.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.06.134 |title=A thermodynamic analysis of biogas partial oxidation to synthesis gas with emphasis on soot formation |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=43 |issue=33 |pages=15703\u201315719 |year=2018 |last1=Nourbakhsh |first1=Hessamodin |last2=Rahbar Shahrouzi |first2=Javad |last3=Zamaniyan |first3=Akbar |last4=Ebrahimi |first4=Hadi |last5=Jafari Nasr |first5=Mohammad Reza }}</ref>\n\n==Steam reforming at small scale==\nThe capital cost of steam reforming plants is considered prohibitive for small to medium size applications.

However, there is an active debate about whether using these fuels to make hydrogen is beneficial while global warming is an issue. Fossil fuel reforming does not eliminate carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere but reduces the carbon dioxide emissions and nearly eliminates carbon monoxide emissions as compared to the burning of conventional fuels due to increased efficiency and fuel cell characteristics.<ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/hydrogen-economy4.htm Fossil fuel reforming not eliminating any carbon dioxides]</ref> However, by turning the release of carbon dioxide into a [[point source]] rather than distributed release, [[carbon capture and storage]] becomes a possibility, which would prevent the carbon dioxide's release to the atmosphere, while adding to the cost of the process.\n\nThe cost of hydrogen production by reforming fossil fuels depends on the scale at which it is done, the capital cost of the reformer and the efficiency of the unit, so that whilst it may cost only a few dollars per kilogram of hydrogen at industrial scale, it could be more expensive at the smaller scale needed for fuel cells.<ref>{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.538.3537 |first1=F.

Some new technologies have overcome this challenge with sulfur-tolerant catalysts.\n* [[Coking]] would be another cause of catalyst deactivation during steam reforming. High reaction temperatures, low steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C), and the complex nature of sulfur-containing commercial hydrocarbon fuels make coking especially favorable. Olefins, typically ethylene, and aromatics are well known carbon-precursors, hence their formation must be reduced during the SR. Additionally, catalysts with lower acidity were reported to be less prone to coking by suppressing dehydrogenation reactions. H2S, the main product in the reforming of organic sulfur, can bind to all transition metal catalysts to form metal\u2013sulfur bonds and subsequently reduce catalyst activity by inhibiting the chemisorption of reforming reactants. Meanwhile, the adsorbed sulfur species increases the catalyst acidity, and hence indirectly promotes coking. Precious metal catalysts such as Rh and Pt have lower tendencies to form bulk sulfides than other metal catalysts such as Ni. Rh and Pt are less prone to sulfur poisoning by only chemisorbing sulfur rather than forming metal sulfides.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apcatb.2014.05.044 |title=Steam reforming of sulfur-containing dodecane on a Rh\u2013Pt catalyst: Influence of process parameters on catalyst stability and coke structure |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |volume=160-161 |pages=525\u2013533 |year=2014 |last1=Zheng |first1=Qinghe |last2=Janke |first2=Christiane |last3=Farrauto |first3=Robert }}</ref>\n* Low temperature [[polymer fuel cell]] membranes can be poisoned by the [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) produced by the reactor, making it necessary to include complex CO-removal systems.

Steam methane reforming (SMR) and autothermal reformer (ATR) are two industrial examples of the primary and secondary reformers, respectively. On the other hand, the process of combined reforming utilizes both of primary and secondary tools for production of synthesis gas, as it is commonly practiced in ammonia manufacturing. For the case of methanol, ATR is fed with nearly pure oxygen (99.5%) rather than air since the presence of excessive N<sub>2</sub> in the syngas would overburden compression and retard the methanol production. The ATR reformer consists of a partial oxidation (POX) chamber (usually non-catalytic medium) and a fixed bed catalytic section. The catalytic fixed bed not only adjusts the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio, but also destroys any probable soot and precursor (e.g. ethylene and acetylene) that may be formed in the POX chamber. Natural gas (NG) is partially oxidized in the combustion chamber by oxygen or air (as an oxidant). Steam to carbon (S/C) ratio that is usually 0.6 in the oxygen-based case has been commercialized by Haldor-Topose Company.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2010.02.021 |title=Arrangement of primary and secondary reformers for synthesis gas production |journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design |volume=88 |issue=10 |pages=1342\u20131350 |year=2010 |last1=Ebrahimi |first1=Hadi |last2=Behroozsarand |first2=Alireza |last3=Zamaniyan |first3=Akbar }}</ref>\n\n== Autothermal reforming ==\nAutothermal reforming (ATR) uses oxygen and carbon dioxide or steam in a reaction with methane to form [[syngas]]. The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic due to the oxidation. When the ATR uses carbon dioxide the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio produced is 1:1; when the ATR uses steam the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio produced is 2.5:1\n\nThe reactions can be described in the following equations, using CO<sub>2</sub>:\n: 2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   3 H<sub>2</sub> + 3 CO + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nAnd using steam:\n: 4 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 10 H<sub>2</sub> + 4 CO\n\nThe outlet temperature of the syngas is between 950-1100 \u00b0C and outlet pressure can be as high as 100 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].<ref>[http://www.topsoe.com/business_areas/methanol/Processes/AutothermalReforming.aspx Topsoe ATR]</ref>\n\nThe main difference between SMR and ATR is that SMR only uses air for combustion as a heat source to create steam, while ATR uses purified oxygen. The advantage of ATR is that the H<sub>2</sub>:CO can be varied, which can be useful for producing specialty products.  For example the production of [[dimethyl ether]] requires a 1:1 H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio.\n\nAlthough more costly to construct, SMR facilities produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than ATR facilities.<ref>[http://www.assemblymag.com/CDA/Archives/edabe122ce5c9010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ AIA: Software Analyzes Cost of Hydrogen Production - Archives - ASSEMBLY<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Partial oxidation ==\n{{main|Partial oxidation}}\nPartial oxidation (POX) occurs when a substoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich syngas.  Being exothermic , POX is, typically, much faster than steam reforming and requires a smaller reactor vessel. As can be seen in chemical reactions of partial oxidation, this process initially produces less hydrogen per unit of the input fuel than is obtained by steam reforming of the same fuel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming |title = Hydrogen Production: Natural Gas Reforming}}</ref>\nNevertheless, tendency to soot formation and relatively low hydrogen production yield are among the major drawbacks of this method.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.06.134 |title=A thermodynamic analysis of biogas partial oxidation to synthesis gas with emphasis on soot formation |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=43 |issue=33 |pages=15703\u201315719 |year=2018 |last1=Nourbakhsh |first1=Hessamodin |last2=Rahbar Shahrouzi |first2=Javad |last3=Zamaniyan |first3=Akbar |last4=Ebrahimi |first4=Hadi |last5=Jafari Nasr |first5=Mohammad Reza }}</ref>\n\n==Steam reforming at small scale==\nThe capital cost of steam reforming plants is considered prohibitive for small to medium size applications.

{"title_page": "Margaret Winstar", "text_new": "[[File:Dalkeith House (36653214790).jpg|thumb|right|Margaret Winstar planned her lover's escape from '''Dalkeith Palace''']]\n'''Margaret Winstar''' (fl. 1590-1600), was a Danish or German courtier in Scotland to [[Anne of Denmark]] commemorated by the ballad the \"[[The Laird o Logie]]\" for rescuing her imprisoned lover.\n\nMargaret Winstar's family background is unclear, although it has been suggested her family name was \"Wenckstern\" or \"Venstermand\". [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] noted that she was descended from a wealthy Danish family.<ref>Thomas Riis, ''Should auld acquaintance be forgot'', vol. 2 (Odense 1988), pp. 296-7: ''CSP Scotland'', vol. 10, p. 752 see TNA SP52/49 f.5.</ref> She was a favoured courtier of Anne of Denmark, whose Scottish household included ladies in waiting and servants from Denmark and the northern states of Germany. Winstar accompanied the queen went she went out riding. The queen's favour to Margaret Winstar is evident in her wardrobe accounts; in July 1592 the queen, Winstar, and the French-born aristocrat [[Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar|Marie Stewart]] were dressed alike in green and orange costumes.<ref>Michael Pearce, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 148-9].</ref> Winstar is remembered because of her relationship and marriage with [[John Wemyss of Logie]], a servant or varlet in the bedchamber of [[James VI of Scotland]], and the daring escape she planned for him, featured in ballads and chronicles.\n==Logie's confession==\nIn 1592, John Wemyss Logie helped [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] who was a rebel against the king.<ref>Alan Stewart, ''The Cradle King'' (London, 2004), p. 133.</ref> He was a son of Andrew Wemyss of Myrecairnie and Logie and a cousin of David Wemyss, laird of [[Wemyss, Fife|West Wemyss]] whose sister Euphemia was a lady-in-waiting to the queen.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memorialsoffamil01fras#page/120/search/logie William Fraser, ''Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 62-4.]</ref> Logie was probably the valet who attended the king at the wedding of [[Lilias Grant|Lilias Murray]], the [[John Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine|Laird of Tullibardine's]] daughter, and [[John Grant of Freuchie (d. 1622)|John Grant]] of [[Castle Grant|Freuchie]] on 21 June 1591.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 148.</ref> Another of Bothwell's supporters, Josias Stewart, was the son of [[Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree]], a senior lady in waiting whose three daughters were maidens of honour in the queen's household. Possibly Logie and Josias Stewart were friends, and Margaret Winstar came to know Logie through this connection.\n\nIn August the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] arrested Logie and [[Michael Balfour, 1st Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Michael Balfour]] of [[Burleigh Castle|Burleigh]]. Logie confessed to planning four different attempts to capture the king. One of these schemes involved Margaret Winstar, identified as his mistress or fianc\u00e9e. She would steal the keys to the back gate of [[Dalkeith Palace]] and let in Bothwell's men. When James interrogated him, Logie was immediately cooperative and withheld nothing. This full and unexpected confession was tantamount to his own death sentence. Logie said that many other royal servants were allies of Bothwell, in part because they had not been paid. He said that Bothwell received money from Spain but Burleigh explained this as a deliberate rumour to encourage Bothwell's supporters. The English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] thought that James VI meant to have Logie executed, but guessed that the queen and Margaret Winstar, who was from a well-connected family and thought to be related to the queen, would intercede to save his life.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 751: Thomas Thomson ed., ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), 207.</ref>\n\n==Escape from Dalkeith Palace==\nLogie was imprisoned in Dalkeith Palace. He escaped with the help of Margaret Winstar who slept in the queen's bedchamber. Winster asked the guards to bring the prisoner to the queen, and then led him through the queen's bedchamber to a window where she had left a rope (or a pair of sheets). An accomplice was waiting below with a horse.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: ''Calendar of Border Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 405: Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 173-4.</ref> The escape echoed the scheme of one of Logie's confessions. The story is the basis of the ballad, \"The Laird of Logie\" and its variant \"The Laird of Ochiltree\".\n\nThe escape was highlighted in a contemporary narrative, ''The Historie and Life of King James the Sext''. The anonymous author calls Margaret \"Twynstoun\". He draws attention to her role in the rescue as an act of charity and a good example for posterity, concluding that by \"hir gude cheritable help he happilie escapit be the subteltie of loove\".<ref>Thomas Thomson ed., ''The Historie and Life of King James the Sext'' (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4.</ref> His narrative of the escape is quoted here with spellings modernised;<blockquote>\"And because the event of this matter had such a success, it shall also be praised by my pen, as a worthy turn, proceeding from honest, chaste love and charity, which should in no way be obscured from posterity for a good example. And therefore I have thought good to insert the same for a perpetual memorial. Queen Anne, our noble Princess, was served with diverse gentlewomen of her own country, and namely, by one called Mistress Margaret Twynstoun, to whom this gentleman, Weymss of Logie, bore great honest affection, tending to the godly band of marriage; the which was honestly requited by the said gentlewoman, yea even in his greatest misfortune.

[[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] noted that she was descended from a wealthy Danish family.<ref>Thomas Riis, ''Should auld acquaintance be forgot'', vol. 2 (Odense 1988), pp. 296-7: ''CSP Scotland'', vol. 10, p. 752 see TNA SP52/49 f.5.</ref> She was a favoured courtier of Anne of Denmark, whose Scottish household included ladies in waiting and servants from Denmark and the northern states of Germany. Winstar accompanied the queen went she went out riding. The queen's favour to Margaret Winstar is evident in her wardrobe accounts; in July 1592 the queen, Winstar, and the French-born aristocrat [[Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar|Marie Stewart]] were dressed alike in green and orange costumes.<ref>Michael Pearce, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 148-9].</ref> Winstar is remembered because of her relationship and marriage with [[John Wemyss of Logie]], a servant or varlet in the bedchamber of [[James VI of Scotland]], and the daring escape she planned for him, featured in ballads and chronicles.\n==Logie's confession==\nIn 1592, John Wemyss Logie helped [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] who was a rebel against the king.<ref>Alan Stewart, ''The Cradle King'' (London, 2004), p. 133.</ref> He was a son of Andrew Wemyss of Myrecairnie and Logie and a cousin of David Wemyss, laird of [[Wemyss, Fife|West Wemyss]] whose sister Euphemia was a lady-in-waiting to the queen.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memorialsoffamil01fras#page/120/search/logie William Fraser, ''Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 62-4.]</ref> Logie was probably the valet who attended the king at the wedding of [[Lilias Grant|Lilias Murray]], the [[John Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine|Laird of Tullibardine's]] daughter, and [[John Grant of Freuchie (d. 1622)|John Grant]] of [[Castle Grant|Freuchie]] on 21 June 1591.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 148.</ref> Another of Bothwell's supporters, Josias Stewart, was the son of [[Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree]], a senior lady in waiting whose three daughters were maidens of honour in the queen's household. Possibly Logie and Josias Stewart were friends, and Margaret Winstar came to know Logie through this connection.\n\nIn August the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] arrested Logie and [[Michael Balfour, 1st Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Michael Balfour]] of [[Burleigh Castle|Burleigh]]. Logie confessed to planning four different attempts to capture the king. One of these schemes involved Margaret Winstar, identified as his mistress or fianc\u00e9e. She would steal the keys to the back gate of [[Dalkeith Palace]] and let in Bothwell's men. When James interrogated him, Logie was immediately cooperative and withheld nothing. This full and unexpected confession was tantamount to his own death sentence. Logie said that many other royal servants were allies of Bothwell, in part because they had not been paid. He said that Bothwell received money from Spain but Burleigh explained this as a deliberate rumour to encourage Bothwell's supporters. The English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] thought that James VI meant to have Logie executed, but guessed that the queen and Margaret Winstar, who was from a well-connected family and thought to be related to the queen, would intercede to save his life.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 751: Thomas Thomson ed., ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), 207.</ref>\n\n==Escape from Dalkeith Palace==\nLogie was imprisoned in Dalkeith Palace. He escaped with the help of Margaret Winstar who slept in the queen's bedchamber. Winster asked the guards to bring the prisoner to the queen, and then led him through the queen's bedchamber to a window where she had left a rope (or a pair of sheets). An accomplice was waiting below with a horse.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: ''Calendar of Border Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 405: Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 173-4.</ref> The escape echoed the scheme of one of Logie's confessions. The story is the basis of the ballad, \"The Laird of Logie\" and its variant \"The Laird of Ochiltree\".\n\nThe escape was highlighted in a contemporary narrative, ''The Historie and Life of King James the Sext''. The anonymous author calls Margaret \"Twynstoun\". He draws attention to her role in the rescue as an act of charity and a good example for posterity, concluding that by \"hir gude cheritable help he happilie escapit be the subteltie of loove\".<ref>Thomas Thomson ed., ''The Historie and Life of King James the Sext'' (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4.</ref> His narrative of the escape is quoted here with spellings modernised;<blockquote>\"And because the event of this matter had such a success, it shall also be praised by my pen, as a worthy turn, proceeding from honest, chaste love and charity, which should in no way be obscured from posterity for a good example. And therefore I have thought good to insert the same for a perpetual memorial. Queen Anne, our noble Princess, was served with diverse gentlewomen of her own country, and namely, by one called Mistress Margaret Twynstoun, to whom this gentleman, Weymss of Logie, bore great honest affection, tending to the godly band of marriage; the which was honestly requited by the said gentlewoman, yea even in his greatest misfortune. For how soon she understood the said gentleman to be in distress, and apparently be his confession, to be punished to the death, and she having privilege to lie in the Queen's chamber, that same very night of his accusation, where the King was also reposing that same night, she came forth of the door privily, both the princes (the king and queen) being then at quiet rest, and passed to the chamber where the said gentleman was put in custody, to certain of the guard, and commanded them that immediately he should be brought to the King and Queen.

The Carabinieri, a branch of the [[Italian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] responsible for both military and civil policing, formed GIS in 1978 as a [[police tactical unit]].<ref name=\"CaraGIS\" /> In 2004, GIS assumed a [[special operations]] role evolving to a special forces unit, in addition to the police tactical unit role, becoming part of the [[Italian special forces|Comando interforze per le Operazioni delle Forze Speciali]] (COFS) ({{lang-en|Joint Special Forces Operational Headquarters}}).<ref name=\"CaraGIS\" /><ref name=\"Difesa\">{{cite web |title=Cp.

Since its inception, GIS has distinguished itself throughout Italy for efficiency and excellent preparation, and has also operated and operates in several theatres of war including [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Horn of Africa]], as well as in all the countries where Italian diplomatic offices are at risk.\n\nIn Italy, GIS is one of three police tactical units that can operate throughout the country, the other two being [[Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza]] (NOCS) of the [[Polizia di Stato]] and [[Counter-terrorism Rapid Response|Antiterrorismo Pronto Impiego]] (ATPI) of the [[Guardia di Finanza]].\n\n== Mission ==\nThe Special Intervention Group is employed in high-risk special actions against terrorism. The GIS specializes in hostage rescue, prioritizing their physical safety, in reconquest of vital targets and facilities held by terrorists, in resolutive intervention against hijacking, in intervention in environments featuring NBCR dangers.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\n=== Domestic roles ===\nThe Special Intervention Group ensures the permanent availability of personnel to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Italy)|Ministry of the Interior]] for immediate deployments. The Ministry of the Interior employs the GIS for the release of hostages from [[airplanes]], [[ships]], [[trains]], [[buses]] and buildings. It also calls them to protect sensitive targets from terrorist or criminal attacks and to ensure surveillance and security at high-risk events (in coordination with Public Security authorities).<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\nAside of the permanent availability ensured to the Interior Ministry, the GIS are used by the General Command of the Carabinieri to guarantee the security of threatened personalities or to assist territorial units in crisis situations such as kidnapping and capturing criminals, fugitives or dangerous evades. The GIS also trains and certifies other Carabinieri assigned to escort duties, and provides security services to important persons.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\n=== Roles abroad ===\n[[File:GIS desertica.JPG|thumb|GIS in desert camo for overseas operations]]\nThe GIS are also deployed abroad, to perform foreign hostage-rescue operations, to protect Italian embassies and consulates in highly dangerous situations, as well as for special intervention in Carabinieri deployments and operations abroad.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\nOccasionally they are also in charge of training foreign police personnel.\n\n=== Special operations ===\nIn 2003, GIS became a special forces unit responsible for special operations, including [[direct action]], [[special reconnaissance]], military assistance and counter terrorism, part of Comando interforze per le Operazioni delle Forze Speciali (COFS) of the Armed Forces, in addition to its civilian police tactical unit role.<ref name=\"Difesa\" /> GIS can deploy overseas for special operations if requested by COFS. In 2015, laws were changed to permit the Italian foreign intelligence service [[Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna]] (AISE) to use GIS for individual missions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ludovico |first1=Marco |title=Intervento italiano in Libia: forze speciali e 007, ma non pi\u00f9 di 100 uomini |url=https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo/2016-03-05/forze-speciali-e-007-non-piu-100-uomini-081242.shtml?uuid=ACq0KLiC |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Il Sole 24 Ore |date=5 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the seventies of the last century (the so-called [[years of lead]]) the Italian political and civil institutions suffered a violent assault by endemic [[terrorist]] groups. Although the Government had not taken any official initiatives, units were set up in the elite units of the Armed Forces and [[Police]] for the development and experimentation of intervention techniques in crisis situations in the presence of hostages.\n\nOn 18 October 1977, the political will changed as a result of the success of Operation Feuerzauber (Magic Fire) conducted by the Germans of the [[GSG-9]] that in Somalia succeeded in freeing 86 passengers and 3 crew members of the [[Lufthansa]] 181 flight hijacked and still in hand of terrorists. Feasibility studies were immediately carried out.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" />\n\nFollowing this action, [[Minister of Interior (Italy)|interior minister]] [[Francesco Cossiga]] on 6 January 1978 ordered the creation of the UN.I.S. (''Unit\u00e0 di Intervento Speciale'', Italian for \"Special Intervention Units\"),<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\">{{cite journal |last1=Iacoviello |first1=Giuseppe |title=Un compleanno speciale.

This unit of the Carabinieri could act both in civil and public order and in the military sphere. The Special Intervention Group was made operationally autonomous, administratively part of the Battalion and logistically supported by the [[Folgore Brigade|''Folgore'' Brigade]].<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.14</sup>\n\nBy December 1981, the Special Intervention Group reached the full operational capability.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.15</sup>\n\nThe public debut of the GIS took place in [[Trani]] on 29 December 1980. In the prison, a revolt led by terrorists broke out. On the building, helicopters began to whirl, from which masked men quickly fell down. They regained control of the prison in a few minutes despite the many gates welded by the rebels to hinder an intervention from outside.\n\n=== Expansion of the scope ===\nIn the following years, the GIS expanded its tasks: in December 1988 the Group, on the proposal of its own commander, was tasked with prevention and counter-sabotage activities, as well as with support of the Carabinieri territorial organisation, sensitive targets surveillance, and high-risk interventions and round-ups against organised crime.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>pp.16-17</sup>\n\nIn 1994, the tasks of the Group were further expanded, including support for the capture of prominent fugitives, in anti-drug operations and in operations aimed at executing orders of the judicial authorities in the presence of environmental characteristics that entail considerable difficulties in execution. An underwater component was also set established and the use of the unit in support of the Italian embassies at risk was also approved.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.17</sup>\n\n=== 2003: special forces unit ===\nThe GIS, because of the minor terrorist emergency , since 2000 has operated mainly in the military, and since 26 November 2003, it has been part of the [[Special forces of Italy|Special Forces]], along with [[COMSUBIN]], [[9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment]] and the [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]].<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.17</sup><ref>[http://corpidelite.net/afm/g-i-s-gruppo-d-intervento-speciale/ G.I.S. Gruppo d'Intervento Speciale | Corpi d' \u00e9lite - Forze speciali italiane, antiterrorismo, intelligence].</ref> \n\nThe decision of converting the GIS into a [[special forces]] unit was taken as consequence of the large overseas deployment of his operators, that distinguished themselves for competence and resolution in various scenarios of war. Already after his creation, the group operated alongside Italian troops in Lebanon during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and since that moment they become an important part of the Italian military actions around the globe.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe GIS headquarters is in [[Livorno]].\n\nThe exact number of operating personnel is a confidential information, but the Group is organized at a company level.\n\nThe GIS is divided into:\n\n* A command section\n* An administrative section\n* A training and exercise section\n* A section of exploration, reconnaissance, and target acquisition\n* A combat section\n* A section of selected shooters\nThe largest combat section, in turn, is divided into three detachments consisting of teams of four men: a commander, an explosive specialist, a climbing specialist and an equipment specialist.\n\nAt any moment there is a detachment ready to leave the base in 30 minutes. For this purpose, there are always some Agusta-Bell AB 412 supplied with the [[Carabinieri]] and a 46th Air Force Aircraft of the Air Force that is located in nearby Pisa, which can supply the [[C-130 Hercules]] when needed. The remaining can be used within three and twenty-four hours of the alarm. In the most urgent cases, an advanced core precedes the operating section in order to plan the intervention strategy based on first-hand information.\n\nThe exploration, reconnaissance and scouting section is in turn made up of teams of three men: two fighters armed with Mauser 86 SR and an explorer equipped with a semiautomatic [[HK PSG-1]]. During longer actions, men can become the explorer.\n\n== Reaction to a threat ==\n* Alarm (ordered from the Operational Room of the General Command of the Armed Force)\n* Staffing (structured on a modular system: a first share of operators is in immediate preparation, a second is operational within 3 hours, while the entire department is active within 24 hours)\n* Transfer to a working area (can be carried out with fast and special cars with helicopters AB 412 of the Elinucleo Carabinieri of Pisa or with aircraft C 130 and G 222 of the 46th aerobigate stationed in Pisa)\n* Device deployment\n* Intervention\n* Evacuation\n\n== Publicly known missions ==\nAs of late 2018, the Special Intervention Group has been involved in more than 600 special operations:<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.20</sup>\n* 28 December 1980, prison of [[Trani]]: Blitz inside the prison where some communist brigades members were barricaded.

It is therefore no longer an indispensable condition to be of the [[1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"]].\n\nThe course is called \"G.I.S. operator with military patent of raider\", because at the end of the training process the military receives the military patent of raider, as it happens in the other three Italian Special Forces already mentioned.\n\nThe carabinieri who apply are sent to the 1st Tuscania Regiment. The first selection phase for the GIS involves an interview with a senior GIS officer who verifies motivation, a key element in becoming part of the department, followed by examination by psychologists and medical doctors. This first selection is passed by 40 percent of the candidates.\n\n=== Paratroopers course (nine months) ===\nThe survivors then begin a very hard training process for the patent of [[Paracadutisti]] at the '' Tuscania '' of about nine months duration (this training is almost identical to the one carried out by the [[1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"]], therefore those who come from the latter are directly introduced to the second phase, namely the specialized one for the GIS).\n\nThe course includes:\n* military parachuting course (launch with tie rope)\n* training in the operational use of ropes\n* operational first aid course (CLS)\n* land guidance and navigation techniques\n* personal defense course (multiple techniques derived from different martial arts, applied to possible operational situations)\n* NBCR course on operations in contaminated environments\n* techniques of masking, camouflage, tactical movement, overcoming obstacles, ability to survive and operate safely in harsh environments\n* patrol and platoon training (standard operating procedures for minor units, amphibious operations, reconnaissance, acquisition of targets, picketing, guerrilla techniques, anti-guerrilla warfare and special operations)\n* survival techniques, evasion, resistance to interrogation and escape\n* training in the use of weapons and special materials (shooting with short, medium, long arms, use of various accessories, explosive or special materials, full knowledge of communications equipment, including satellite, supplied to the department)\n* combat and patrolling techniques in urban areas (MOUT / FIBUA / FIWAF)\n* Military Police techniques, Counter-IED, HUMINT and for use in multinational units and commands.\n\nThe carabinieri who finish the training period cited, about 30 percent of the initial candidates, are admitted to the 45-week course divided into a '' Basic Course '' of 18 weeks (exceeded by more than 50 percent of candidates) and to a 27-week \"Specialized Course\". Only at this point does the soldier become operational and an effective member of the department.\n\n=== Basic course G.I.S. (18 weeks) ===\n* '' Physical exercises and martial arts' ': in addition to intense physical exercise, candidates learn [[martial arts]] (especially' '[[Judo]]' ',' '[[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]]' 'e' '[[Thai boxe]]' ') to disarm, immobilize and, in general, to face close combat without the use of firearms\n* '' Explosives '': construction, use and disengagement of explosive devices\n* '' Firearms '': use of long and short firearms (pistols, machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles), choice of the type of weapon and ammunition according to the operational scenario\n* '' Special equipment '': use of electronic surveillance equipment such as night vision devices, fiber optic cameras, microphones, as well as mechanical intrusion devices such as those used for breaking doors\n* '' Break-in techniques '': methods of breaking into buildings, vehicles, aircraft, etc.\n* '' Climbing and descending techniques '': climbing in different situations using ropes, ladders and other instruments; use of the [[fast rope]] technique for rapid descent from buildings or helicopters\n* '' Photographic techniques '': basic techniques of photography and use of cameras, video cameras, equipment for thermal and infrared recording, image processing. Assignment to the section of the explorers / scouts will further deepen these concepts.\n* '' Evaluation of objectives '': collection of useful information for planning an action such as the robustness and type of materials of doors, windows and structures\n* '' Shooting '': shooting exercise especially against static targets using both a system known as '' FATS '' ('' [[FireArm Training System]] ''), an interactive laser system that projects images onto a screen and records all student reactions; both fire tests with real ammunition\n* '' Police activities '': arrest techniques\n* ''English''\n* '' Escort at high risk ''\n* '' First aid techniques ''\n\n=== Specialized Course G.I.S. (27 weeks) ===\n\n* '' Advanced shot '': shooting against moving targets and, in the presence of hostages to learn to discriminate between hostile or innocent individuals in fractions of a second; shooting from difficult positions and with both hands, either alone or in a team using real ammunition.\n* '' Advanced techniques with explosives '': usage of explosives in the presence of hostages, characteristics and choice of explosives and the amount and mode of use to minimize collateral damage. Use of gas and their use with grenades of 40&nbsp;mm.\n* '' Skiing and climbing '': attended at the Alpine Center of the Carabinieri in [[Selva di Val Gardena]] and in the school of [[Alpini]] ad [[Aosta]]\n* '' Quick Guide '': defensive and offensive driving techniques\n* '' Swimming and amphibious assault '': attended at the Sub Center of the [[Carabinieri]] of [[Genoa-Voltri]], then at the [[COMSUBIN]] of [[Italian Navy | Navy]] to learn techniques of reconnaissance, approach, assault and amphibious combat, as well as the use of equipment for '' ARO / ARA '' divers, motor boats and dinghies.\n* '' Infrastructures '': buildings, trains, planes and buses are studied, which characterize the possible theaters of use. To this end, the GIS have a very detailed archive of sensitive objectives such as [[embassy | embassies]], public buildings, [[company | industries]], as well as specific simulacra models of vehicles and aircraft to train with.\n* '' Guerrilla and counter-guerrilla tactics '': to learn the techniques commonly used by terrorists such as ambushes, counter-ambushes, neutralization of opponents, and combat in urban areas.\n* '' Assault on Aircraft '': GIS are the main aircraft assault unit in Italy. They conduct specific exercises with life-size simulacra to learn and perfect the use of explosives and other techniques for breaking doors, use of telescopic ladders, thermal sensors and other tools and techniques applicable in those situations.\n\nOnce part of GIS, training is daily and their skills are perfected with further courses:\n\n=== Strengthening courses ===\n\n* Parachuting course with the technique of free fall (TCL). It takes place at the Parachute Training Center (CAPAR) of [[Pisa]] for a period of between five and six weeks, during which launches are made from a maximum height of 3000\u20134000 meters (10,000 feet)\n* Advanced parachuting course, lasting 3\u20134 weeks, for learning the techniques for high altitude launches (of 7.000\u201311.000 meters) with oxygen at low altitude opening\u2014HALO (High Altitude Low Opening)\u2014or with opening at high altitude and sailing under sail\u2014HAHO (High Altitude High Opening).\n\n=== Courses for specialties ===\n\n('' An operative detachment has: an Incursor with a Combat Medic specialization, a Breacher: EOD-IEDD deactivator, a SFJTAC - Special Forces Joint Terminal Attack Controller, and one or two Snipers ''.\n\n* Courses for '' Selected shooters '': only attended by the candidates of the section '' exploration, reconnaissance and selected shooters '' to learn precision shooting and snipers, concealment and camouflage techniques, coordinated fire and use of different types of weaponry and crosshairs. For coordinated fire between several shooters, they train to use the [[Synchropy]] system, which allows the action manager to see what is being framed by the individual shooters and to control the simultaneous fire.\n* EOD Course (Explosive Ordinance Reclamation Operator) and IEDD Course (Improvised Explosive Ordinance Reclamation Operator)\n* Course [[Combat Medic]]. At national level the Incursori destined to this sector obtain the qualification of \"Military Rescuer\" at the Medical School of [[Rome]], after a three-week course that guarantees, among other things, a sort of legal capacity to operate within the first aid, even if with significant limitations. Special Operations Combat Medics (SOCM) Course \", performed at the ISTC in Pfullendorf and teaches basic first aid procedures, such as stopping bleeding and ensuring proper infusion and shock therapy, and especially the prestigious 18D course\u2014Special Operations Combat Medic \"of the American Green Berets. With a total duration of about one year, the latter is held at Fort Bragg and is exclusively dedicated to Special Forces (for Italy, [[COMSUBIN]], [[GIS]] and [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]] also attend the course).\n* Course FAC (Forward Air Controller), to qualify for the missions related to the direction from the ground of the airstrikes and the designation to the pilots of the objectives, held at the School of Aerospace Aeronautics, lasting five weeks (three theoretical and two practice). This qualification is limited to the elements in possession of the necessary level of proficiency in English (which can be achieved with the frequency of the advanced course at the SLEE in [[Perugia]]). As a rule, the course is followed by that of Fire Contractor for Special Operations (CF / OS), a further three weeks. All of this is a prelude to the Laser Target Marking function (FAC / LTM) for the use of the laser designators supplied with the Regiment. The training for the use of the relative laser designators takes place with courses of a couple of weeks, which are held in the main allied polygons (in Sardinia, as abroad), or even on the occasion of external missions, while the detachments are in the theater of war.\n\n=== Courses abroad ===\nFinally, there are ongoing collaborative relationships with military departments, including foreign ones. In fact, other courses are held abroad by the International Special Training Center\u2014ISTC in Pfullendorf, [[Germany]], the [[NATO]] Special Forces school, and various joint exercises with the colleagues of the SF and Antiterrorism ([[Special Air Service|SAS]] '' ''\u2014Great Britain, [[SWAT]] '' ''\u2014USA, [[GSG9]]\u2014Germany, [[GIGN]]\u2014France) of other countries.\n\n== Commander Alfa ==\nCommander Alfa is a key figure in GIS history. He was one of the founding members and his nickname was given to him by his recruits.\nThe old operator is the only one allowed to talk publicly and represents the link between mass media and the group.\nHe is also famous for writing books that explain what it means to be part of a special group and outlines the public operations that GIS has undergone since its foundation.  The two books are 'Swallow Heart' and 'I live in the darkness'.\nAlfa is also the only Italian special force operator to have officially removed his mephisto during an operation, in order to calm a child.\n\n== Alliances ==\nGIS has very good relations with other top class CT units in the world, among these are [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]'s [[Special Air Service|SAS]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Army Ranger Wing|ARW]] & [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|ERU]], [[Spain]]'s [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] and [[Unidad Especial de Intervenci\u00f3n|UEI]], [[France]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]], [[United States]]'s [[Hostage Rescue Team]], [[Germany]]'s [[GSG 9]] and [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]], [[Belgium]]'s [[Federal Police Special Units|ESI]], [[Austria]]'s [[EKO Cobra]] and the [[Netherlands]]'s [[Dienst Speciale Interventies|DSI]].<ref name=\"SO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Italy/GIS.htm|title=Gruppo Intervento Speciale (GIS) - Special Intervention Group|accessdate=2012-03-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208033140/http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Italy/GIS.htm|archivedate=2010-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2008/ranaldo_081013.1.html|title=Speciale GIS, i professionisti dell'anti-terrorismo|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian|date=2008-10-13|author=Giovanna Ranaldo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821052932/http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2008/ranaldo_081013.1.html|archive-date=2011-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Weapons ==\n* [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92FS]], standard handgun<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Caracal pistol]] \n* [[Glock pistols|Glock 17 and 19]]<ref name=\"Armi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giscarabinieri.altervista.org/Armi.htm|title=Unofficial GIS Arms Page|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian}}</ref>\n* [[Smith & Wesson Model 28]] [[.357 Magnum]] revolver (for backup in VIP Protection duties)<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Beretta 93R]]\n* [[Benelli M1 Super 90]]\n* [[Benelli M3]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/> - replaced the older [[Franchi SPAS-12]],<ref name=\"SO\"/> ''Franchi PA-3'',<ref name=\"SO\"/> ''Franchi PA-7/PA-8 series'' and ''Beretta M3P'' shotguns\n* [[Benelli M4 Super 90]] - replaced the [[Franchi SPAS-15]].<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Beretta M12|Beretta PM-12 series submachineguns]], still in arsenal yet mostly superseded<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5]], the most common weapon to equip GIS operators in A5, SD3 and KA4 versions.<ref name=\"SO\"/><ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[FN P90]] (in limited quantities)\n* [[Steyr TMP]] (employed for VIP Protection duties)<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] (in limited quantities, most probably tested to supersede the Steyr TMP)\n* [[Beretta AR70/90|Beretta 70/90 Weapons system]]<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Beretta ARX160]] used by [[Carabinieri]]\n* [[Steyr AUG]] - adopted for ease of use from vehicles and helicopters, now mostly superseded<ref name=\"SO\"/><ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[M4 carbine|Bushmaster M4 carbine]] - procured in limited quantities jointly with the [[Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"|\"Tuscania\" Regiment]] to supersede the Steyr AUG\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK33#Variants|Heckler & Koch HK53]] - mostly superseded (last seen fielded during [[Operation Ancient Babylon]], sometimes paired with the British-made Istec ISL-201 [[40 mm]] undercarried [[grenade launcher]])<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch G36|Heckler & Koch G36 family of weapons]] - G36 with 1.5x scope<ref name=\"AdC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.corpidelite.net/G.I.Sarmi.htm|title=Arma dei Carabinieri|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114160341/http://www.corpidelite.net/G.I.Sarmi.htm|archivedate=2011-11-14}}</ref> and G36C<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]], either under-carried or in Stand-alone configurations&nbsp;\u2014 interface/mounting system for weapons, as well as some parts (most notably the receiver) manufactured in Italy by PMAL (''Polo di Mantenimento delle Armi Leggere'', [[Italian Army]] arsenal) in [[Terni]]\n* [[FN SCAR|SCAR-L]]\n* [[FN SCAR|SCAR-H]]\n* [[M-249]]\n* Accuracy International AWP<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch PSG1|HK MSG-90 and PSG1]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/><ref name=\"AdC\"/>\n* [[Mauser|Mauser 86-SR]] - Armed with synchofire systems<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* Sako TRG-42<ref name=\"AdC\"/>\n* [[Barrett M82]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK416]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK417]]\n\n== Uniforms ==\n{{Main|Uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe uniform utilized by this elite force is normally the dark blue, even though mimetic and desert variations exist.

Since its inception, GIS has distinguished itself throughout Italy for efficiency and excellent preparation, and has also operated and operates in several theatres of war including [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Horn of Africa]], as well as in all the countries where Italian diplomatic offices are at risk.\n\nIn Italy, GIS is one of three police tactical units that can operate throughout the country, the other two being [[Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza]] (NOCS) of the [[Polizia di Stato]] and [[Counter-terrorism Rapid Response|Antiterrorismo Pronto Impiego]] (ATPI) of the [[Guardia di Finanza]].\n\n== Mission ==\nThe Special Intervention Group is employed in high-risk special actions against terrorism. The GIS specializes in hostage rescue, prioritizing their physical safety, in reconquest of vital targets and facilities held by terrorists, in resolutive intervention against hijacking, in intervention in environments featuring NBCR dangers.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\n=== Domestic roles ===\nThe Special Intervention Group ensures the permanent availability of personnel to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Italy)|Ministry of the Interior]] for immediate deployments. The Ministry of the Interior employs the GIS for the release of hostages from [[airplanes]], [[ships]], [[trains]], [[buses]] and buildings. It also calls them to protect sensitive targets from terrorist or criminal attacks and to ensure surveillance and security at high-risk events (in coordination with Public Security authorities).<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.18</sup>\n\nAside of the permanent availability ensured to the Interior Ministry, the GIS are used by the General Command of the Carabinieri to guarantee the security of threatened personalities or to assist territorial units in crisis situations such as kidnapping and capturing criminals, fugitives or dangerous evades.

Although the Government had not taken any official initiatives, units were set up in the elite units of the Armed Forces and [[Police]] for the development and experimentation of intervention techniques in crisis situations in the presence of hostages.\n\nOn 18 October 1977, the political will changed as a result of the success of Operation Feuerzauber (Magic Fire) conducted by the Germans of the [[GSG-9]] that in Somalia succeeded in freeing 86 passengers and 3 crew members of the [[Lufthansa]] 181 flight hijacked and still in hand of terrorists. Feasibility studies were immediately carried out.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" />\n\nFollowing this action, [[Minister of Interior (Italy)|interior minister]] [[Francesco Cossiga]] on 6 January 1978 ordered the creation of the UN.I.S.

This unit of the Carabinieri could act both in civil and public order and in the military sphere. The Special Intervention Group was made operationally autonomous, administratively part of the Battalion and logistically supported by the [[Folgore Brigade|''Folgore'' Brigade]].<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.14</sup>\n\nBy December 1981, the Special Intervention Group reached the full operational capability.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.15</sup>\n\nThe public debut of the GIS took place in [[Trani]] on 29 December 1980. In the prison, a revolt led by terrorists broke out. On the building, helicopters began to whirl, from which masked men quickly fell down. They regained control of the prison in a few minutes despite the many gates welded by the rebels to hinder an intervention from outside.\n\n=== Expansion of the scope ===\nIn the following years, the GIS expanded its tasks: in December 1988 the Group, on the proposal of its own commander, was tasked with prevention and counter-sabotage activities, as well as with support of the Carabinieri territorial organisation, sensitive targets surveillance, and high-risk interventions and round-ups against organised crime.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>pp.16-17</sup>\n\nIn 1994, the tasks of the Group were further expanded, including support for the capture of prominent fugitives, in anti-drug operations and in operations aimed at executing orders of the judicial authorities in the presence of environmental characteristics that entail considerable difficulties in execution. An underwater component was also set established and the use of the unit in support of the Italian embassies at risk was also approved.<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.17</sup>\n\n=== 2003: special forces unit ===\nThe GIS, because of the minor terrorist emergency , since 2000 has operated mainly in the military, and since 26 November 2003, it has been part of the [[Special forces of Italy|Special Forces]], along with [[COMSUBIN]], [[9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment]] and the [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]].<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.17</sup><ref>[http://corpidelite.net/afm/g-i-s-gruppo-d-intervento-speciale/ G.I.S.

Already after his creation, the group operated alongside Italian troops in Lebanon during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and since that moment they become an important part of the Italian military actions around the globe.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe GIS headquarters is in [[Livorno]].\n\nThe exact number of operating personnel is a confidential information, but the Group is organized at a company level.\n\nThe GIS is divided into:\n\n* A command section\n* An administrative section\n* A training and exercise section\n* A section of exploration, reconnaissance, and target acquisition\n* A combat section\n* A section of selected shooters\nThe largest combat section, in turn, is divided into three detachments consisting of teams of four men: a commander, an explosive specialist, a climbing specialist and an equipment specialist.\n\nAt any moment there is a detachment ready to leave the base in 30 minutes. For this purpose, there are always some Agusta-Bell AB 412 supplied with the [[Carabinieri]] and a 46th Air Force Aircraft of the Air Force that is located in nearby Pisa, which can supply the [[C-130 Hercules]] when needed. The remaining can be used within three and twenty-four hours of the alarm. In the most urgent cases, an advanced core precedes the operating section in order to plan the intervention strategy based on first-hand information.\n\nThe exploration, reconnaissance and scouting section is in turn made up of teams of three men: two fighters armed with Mauser 86 SR and an explorer equipped with a semiautomatic [[HK PSG-1]]. During longer actions, men can become the explorer.\n\n== Reaction to a threat ==\n* Alarm (ordered from the Operational Room of the General Command of the Armed Force)\n* Staffing (structured on a modular system: a first share of operators is in immediate preparation, a second is operational within 3 hours, while the entire department is active within 24 hours)\n* Transfer to a working area (can be carried out with fast and special cars with helicopters AB 412 of the Elinucleo Carabinieri of Pisa or with aircraft C 130 and G 222 of the 46th aerobigate stationed in Pisa)\n* Device deployment\n* Intervention\n* Evacuation\n\n== Publicly known missions ==\nAs of late 2018, the Special Intervention Group has been involved in more than 600 special operations:<ref name=\"IacovielloGISNotSto\" /><sup>p.20</sup>\n* 28 December 1980, prison of [[Trani]]: Blitz inside the prison where some communist brigades members were barricaded.

To this end, the GIS have a very detailed archive of sensitive objectives such as [[embassy | embassies]], public buildings, [[company | industries]], as well as specific simulacra models of vehicles and aircraft to train with.\n* '' Guerrilla and counter-guerrilla tactics '': to learn the techniques commonly used by terrorists such as ambushes, counter-ambushes, neutralization of opponents, and combat in urban areas.\n* '' Assault on Aircraft '': GIS are the main aircraft assault unit in Italy. They conduct specific exercises with life-size simulacra to learn and perfect the use of explosives and other techniques for breaking doors, use of telescopic ladders, thermal sensors and other tools and techniques applicable in those situations.\n\nOnce part of GIS, training is daily and their skills are perfected with further courses:\n\n=== Strengthening courses ===\n\n* Parachuting course with the technique of free fall (TCL). It takes place at the Parachute Training Center (CAPAR) of [[Pisa]] for a period of between five and six weeks, during which launches are made from a maximum height of 3000\u20134000 meters (10,000 feet)\n* Advanced parachuting course, lasting 3\u20134 weeks, for learning the techniques for high altitude launches (of 7.000\u201311.000 meters) with oxygen at low altitude opening\u2014HALO (High Altitude Low Opening)\u2014or with opening at high altitude and sailing under sail\u2014HAHO (High Altitude High Opening).\n\n=== Courses for specialties ===\n\n('' An operative detachment has: an Incursor with a Combat Medic specialization, a Breacher: EOD-IEDD deactivator, a SFJTAC - Special Forces Joint Terminal Attack Controller, and one or two Snipers ''.\n\n* Courses for '' Selected shooters '': only attended by the candidates of the section '' exploration, reconnaissance and selected shooters '' to learn precision shooting and snipers, concealment and camouflage techniques, coordinated fire and use of different types of weaponry and crosshairs. For coordinated fire between several shooters, they train to use the [[Synchropy]] system, which allows the action manager to see what is being framed by the individual shooters and to control the simultaneous fire.\n* EOD Course (Explosive Ordinance Reclamation Operator) and IEDD Course (Improvised Explosive Ordinance Reclamation Operator)\n* Course [[Combat Medic]]. At national level the Incursori destined to this sector obtain the qualification of \"Military Rescuer\" at the Medical School of [[Rome]], after a three-week course that guarantees, among other things, a sort of legal capacity to operate within the first aid, even if with significant limitations. Special Operations Combat Medics (SOCM) Course \", performed at the ISTC in Pfullendorf and teaches basic first aid procedures, such as stopping bleeding and ensuring proper infusion and shock therapy, and especially the prestigious 18D course\u2014Special Operations Combat Medic \"of the American Green Berets. With a total duration of about one year, the latter is held at Fort Bragg and is exclusively dedicated to Special Forces (for Italy, [[COMSUBIN]], [[GIS]] and [[17\u00ba Stormo Incursori]] also attend the course).\n* Course FAC (Forward Air Controller), to qualify for the missions related to the direction from the ground of the airstrikes and the designation to the pilots of the objectives, held at the School of Aerospace Aeronautics, lasting five weeks (three theoretical and two practice). This qualification is limited to the elements in possession of the necessary level of proficiency in English (which can be achieved with the frequency of the advanced course at the SLEE in [[Perugia]]). As a rule, the course is followed by that of Fire Contractor for Special Operations (CF / OS), a further three weeks. All of this is a prelude to the Laser Target Marking function (FAC / LTM) for the use of the laser designators supplied with the Regiment. The training for the use of the relative laser designators takes place with courses of a couple of weeks, which are held in the main allied polygons (in Sardinia, as abroad), or even on the occasion of external missions, while the detachments are in the theater of war.\n\n=== Courses abroad ===\nFinally, there are ongoing collaborative relationships with military departments, including foreign ones. In fact, other courses are held abroad by the International Special Training Center\u2014ISTC in Pfullendorf, [[Germany]], the [[NATO]] Special Forces school, and various joint exercises with the colleagues of the SF and Antiterrorism ([[Special Air Service|SAS]] '' ''\u2014Great Britain, [[SWAT]] '' ''\u2014USA, [[GSG9]]\u2014Germany, [[GIGN]]\u2014France) of other countries.\n\n== Commander Alfa ==\nCommander Alfa is a key figure in GIS history. He was one of the founding members and his nickname was given to him by his recruits.\nThe old operator is the only one allowed to talk publicly and represents the link between mass media and the group.\nHe is also famous for writing books that explain what it means to be part of a special group and outlines the public operations that GIS has undergone since its foundation.  The two books are 'Swallow Heart' and 'I live in the darkness'.\nAlfa is also the only Italian special force operator to have officially removed his mephisto during an operation, in order to calm a child.\n\n== Alliances ==\nGIS has very good relations with other top class CT units in the world, among these are [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]'s [[Special Air Service|SAS]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Army Ranger Wing|ARW]] & [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|ERU]], [[Spain]]'s [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] and [[Unidad Especial de Intervenci\u00f3n|UEI]], [[France]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]], [[United States]]'s [[Hostage Rescue Team]], [[Germany]]'s [[GSG 9]] and [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]], [[Belgium]]'s [[Federal Police Special Units|ESI]], [[Austria]]'s [[EKO Cobra]] and the [[Netherlands]]'s [[Dienst Speciale Interventies|DSI]].<ref name=\"SO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Italy/GIS.htm|title=Gruppo Intervento Speciale (GIS) - Special Intervention Group|accessdate=2012-03-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208033140/http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Italy/GIS.htm|archivedate=2010-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2008/ranaldo_081013.1.html|title=Speciale GIS, i professionisti dell'anti-terrorismo|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian|date=2008-10-13|author=Giovanna Ranaldo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821052932/http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2008/ranaldo_081013.1.html|archive-date=2011-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Weapons ==\n* [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92FS]], standard handgun<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Caracal pistol]] \n* [[Glock pistols|Glock 17 and 19]]<ref name=\"Armi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giscarabinieri.altervista.org/Armi.htm|title=Unofficial GIS Arms Page|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian}}</ref>\n* [[Smith & Wesson Model 28]] [[.357 Magnum]] revolver (for backup in VIP Protection duties)<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Beretta 93R]]\n* [[Benelli M1 Super 90]]\n* [[Benelli M3]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/> - replaced the older [[Franchi SPAS-12]],<ref name=\"SO\"/> ''Franchi PA-3'',<ref name=\"SO\"/> ''Franchi PA-7/PA-8 series'' and ''Beretta M3P'' shotguns\n* [[Benelli M4 Super 90]] - replaced the [[Franchi SPAS-15]].<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Beretta M12|Beretta PM-12 series submachineguns]], still in arsenal yet mostly superseded<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5]], the most common weapon to equip GIS operators in A5, SD3 and KA4 versions.<ref name=\"SO\"/><ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[FN P90]] (in limited quantities)\n* [[Steyr TMP]] (employed for VIP Protection duties)<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] (in limited quantities, most probably tested to supersede the Steyr TMP)\n* [[Beretta AR70/90|Beretta 70/90 Weapons system]]<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Beretta ARX160]] used by [[Carabinieri]]\n* [[Steyr AUG]] - adopted for ease of use from vehicles and helicopters, now mostly superseded<ref name=\"SO\"/><ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[M4 carbine|Bushmaster M4 carbine]] - procured in limited quantities jointly with the [[Carabinieri Regiment \"Tuscania\"|\"Tuscania\" Regiment]] to supersede the Steyr AUG\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK33#Variants|Heckler & Koch HK53]] - mostly superseded (last seen fielded during [[Operation Ancient Babylon]], sometimes paired with the British-made Istec ISL-201 [[40 mm]] undercarried [[grenade launcher]])<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch G36|Heckler & Koch G36 family of weapons]] - G36 with 1.5x scope<ref name=\"AdC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.corpidelite.net/G.I.Sarmi.htm|title=Arma dei Carabinieri|accessdate=2012-03-07|language=Italian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114160341/http://www.corpidelite.net/G.I.Sarmi.htm|archivedate=2011-11-14}}</ref> and G36C<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]], either under-carried or in Stand-alone configurations&nbsp;\u2014 interface/mounting system for weapons, as well as some parts (most notably the receiver) manufactured in Italy by PMAL (''Polo di Mantenimento delle Armi Leggere'', [[Italian Army]] arsenal) in [[Terni]]\n* [[FN SCAR|SCAR-L]]\n* [[FN SCAR|SCAR-H]]\n* [[M-249]]\n* Accuracy International AWP<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch PSG1|HK MSG-90 and PSG1]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/><ref name=\"AdC\"/>\n* [[Mauser|Mauser 86-SR]] - Armed with synchofire systems<ref name=\"SO\"/>\n* Sako TRG-42<ref name=\"AdC\"/>\n* [[Barrett M82]]<ref name=\"Armi\"/>\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK416]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch HK417]]\n\n== Uniforms ==\n{{Main|Uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe uniform utilized by this elite force is normally the dark blue, even though mimetic and desert variations exist.

Focusing on a team of superheroes of the same name, it was published by [[Wildstorm]] comics, then still a part of [[Image Comics]], as a continuation of the series ''[[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Backlash]]''. After the series was canceled, the team's final story was told in the pages of ''[[Gen-Active]]'', an [[anthology]] series.\n\n==History==\nThe story of Wildcore starts in the pages of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Backlash]], where Marc Slayton (aka Backlash) and his girlfriend Amanda Reed (aka Taboo) work with the U.S. government's secret organization ''Department PSI''. Slayton had collected a group of superhuman agents to assist him in his missions, but at the beginning of Wildcore, many of these agents have left or are reassigned. As a replacement, Wildcore is formed to combat the alien [[D'rahn]].\n\nThe D'rahn are an ancient enemy of the [[Kherubim]] and [[Daemonite]]s, who have appeared again after millennia of absence and are planning on taking over the world and the galaxy. The D'rahn claim the Kherubim, their former allies, betrayed them and therefore want revenge on the Kherubim first and foremost. Backlash, being half-Kherubim, and Ferrian, a full-blood Kherubim, are both members of Wildcore, making Wildcore a primary target for the D'rahn. Department PSI-director Antonio Giovanni also hires [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], another Kherubim, who has experience fighting the D'rahn.\n\nZealot is sent to infiltrate the Norfolk Naval base, where General Gant resides. Gant, as the leader of the Puritans (a group of humans who plan on eliminating all aliens on Earth), has a list with all suspected aliens on Earth. The D'rahn plan on obtaining the list so they can locate and strike against the remaining Kherubim on Earth. The Norfolk Naval base is protected by '''the Chasers''', a group of superhumans, but when the D'rahn attack, the Chasers turn out to be no match for them. Zealot, Gant, and the Chaser leader Brawl survive the D'rahn's initial attack, but it turns out that Gant is a Daemonite. Gant and his Daemonites make a deal with the D'rahn: they will serve the D'rahn and, in return, the D'rahn will spare them. The D'rahn then reveal their special ability, ''Enlightenment'', which allows them to change a being into a more powerful version. The D'rahn ''enlighten'' Gant's Daemonites. Wildcore is sent in and they manage to delete most of the list, but ten names remain on it. Brawl joins Wildcore and the team sets out to protect the names on the list.\n\n===On the offensive===\n\nThe first target is Guy Blackfoot, but Wildcore is too late. Blackfoot is killed and one of the D'rahn enlightens his fiance Alea, changing her into a superhuman. Meanwhile, Zealot and Ferrian ask [[Mister Majestic]] for assistance against the D'rahn. It is also revealed that the mage Azrum, part of Backlash's former group in Department PSI, was asked by Giovanni to seek out the witch Tapestry, hoping to use her magic against the D'rahn. Azrum hasn't contacted them since, so Wildcore decides to go on the offensive; Department PSI has located the D'rahn's base and Wildcore attacks. They are joined by Majestic and he kills the D'rahn's leader, Typhon. The D'rahn retreat to regroup.\n\nWildcore goes to investigate Azrum's disappearance and find that Tapestry has captured him. Tapestry uses her magic to enslave Zealot and wants to reshape the world in her image. The other Wildcore members manage to interfere with the spell. Wildcore and Tapestry are now on a [[medieval]] [[fantasy]]-type world and no longer remember their past. Only Ferrian manages to regain his memory and he gathers his former team to oppose Tapestry. They succeed and return to Earth, but Styrian is killed and Geist follows them back to Earth. Zealot leaves the team shortly afterward.\n\n===Antarctica===\n\nBy 2001, as seen in the ''[[Gen-Active]]'' series, Geist has joined Wildcore and Alea has become an active member. The team is sent to Antarctica to quell the riot in Purgatory Maximum Security Penitentiary (nicknamed Purgatory Max), a prison for dangerous superhumans; supervillain Baron T\u00f6dt (see notes) and his group, the Axis, entered the prison, killed all personnel and released all prisoners. Despite Taboo's bad feelings about the mission, the team enters the prison. The mission turns out disastrous: the inmates overpower the separated Wildcore members and kill most of them. Taboo is saved by inmate Hangman, a prisoner who is seeking salvation. He warns her that the prison is about to explode. Backlash finds the explosives a second before they blow and is caught in the blast. Another inmate, former [[DV8]] member [[Evo (Wildstorm)|Evo]], who had been Hangman's cellmate, saves Backlash and takes him outside. Evo, Backlash, and Taboo are all badly hurt and lose consciousness. Hangman congratulates Evo on doing the right thing, activates Backlash's beacon, and leaves. Department PSI arrives and finds five bodies, telling his subordinates to take them back to a hospital and that all others must have died. (see notes)\n\nCrimson, now calling herself Jet, decides to avenge her father and friends by looking for the escaped inmates and capturing them. [[Midnighter]] was asked to do the same by [[Battalion (WildStorm)|Jackson King]] and assists Jet for a while, but allows her to handle things herself as she wishes.\n\nAround this time, Wildcore is seen assisting in the worldwide emergency of Jacob Krigstein's super-powered agents attacking the world's major capitals.\n\nBacklash appears again in the pages of [[Point Blank (comics)|Point Blank]] and [[Sleeper (comic book)|Sleeper]] without any of his teammates and with a bionic leg replacing the leg he lost in the Purgatory Max explosion.\n\n==Characters==\n*[[Backlash (Marc Slayton)]]: leader of Wildcore, Colonel Marc Slayton is half-Kherubim/half-human and has been active as a warrior and superhero for centuries, even though he couldn't remember most of it. Backlash can generate whips made of energy and turn himself into mist.\n*Taboo (Amanda Reed): Marc's girlfriend, Taboo gains her powers from a vampiric, symbiotic costume grafted to her body. The costume allows her to fly, increases her strength and durability, and gives her [[psionic]] powers.\n*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] (Zannah): A Kherubim warrior and former [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] member, Zealot joined to stop the D'rahn but left the team before the Purgatory Max mission and returned to the WildC.A.Ts. As she was hired by Giovanni without Slayton's consent, there were frequent clashes between Backlash and Zealot on matters of leadership.\n*Ferrian: Another Kherubim, Ferrian was Marc Slayton's guardian during his youth. Highly intelligent, Ferrian serves as the team's strategist. He is also a capable warrior and has [[psychometric]] powers.\n*Vigor (Richard Vincent): An archaeologist and friend of Ferrian. Vigor has limitless stamina and can fire energy blasts from a gem he wears on his forehead.\n*Brawl: former leader of the Chasers, Brawl joined Wildcore to avenge his teammates' death at the hands of the D'rahn. Brawl has superhuman strength and durability.\n*Styrian (Omar Kamadev): The son of Antonio Giovanni's best friend, Styrian was placed on the team without Backlash knowing anything about him. Styrian had a romantic relationship with Jodi, Slayton's daughter, which caused some tension between the two, but Styrian died saving Backlash. Styrian could fly and control the weather.\n*Alea (last name unknown): Fiance of D'rahn victim Guy Blackfoot, Alea was changed into a superhuman being by the D'rahn Pildra, who intended to use her as a [[Trojan horse]]. Alea was part of Wildcore but was still training during most missions. She was with the team on the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission. Her skin was changed into a [[ruby]]-like substance, giving her superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to absorb and re-emit energy.\n*Geist: Taboo's lover on Tapestry's world, he secretly followed her to Earth. Unable to handle Taboo's change in personality and to a human, he lashed out in anger against Wildcore but was defeated. Geist was with the team for the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission. Geist had the ability to blend into the background. He also displayed incredible agility and fighting skills.\n*Azrum: A powerful mage, Azrum initially wasn't part of Wildcore, but he was sent to find Tapestry as the D'rahn had no defense against magic. He was with the team for the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission.\n*[[Jet (Wildstorm)|Crimson]] (Jodi Slayton): Though officially not a member of Wildcore, Jodi went on most missions with them. She had a relationship with Styrian and was shocked by his death. She left Department PSI and changed her name to Jet.\n*Antonio Giovanni, head of Department PSI.\n\n==Notes==\n* Only Evo, Backlash, and Taboo are seen on-panel as survivors when Hangman disappears. Department PSI finds five bodies though, so two other Wildcore members may have survived. These two others are not Azrum, Geist, or Alea, as one of Giovanni's men asks about them. Except for Backlash, none of the other members have been seen since.\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=team|id=490|title=Wildcore}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=3787|title=''Wildcore''}}\n\n[[Category:1997 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Wildstorm Publications titles]]\n[[Category:Wildstorm Publications superhero teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2014}}\n{{Infobox comic book title|  <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|title=Wildcore\n|image=Wildcore 1 cover.JPG\n|imagesize=200\n|caption=Wildcore #1\n|schedule=\n|format=\n|publisher=[[Wildstorm]], [[Image Comics]]\n|date=November [[1997 in comics|1997]]&nbsp;\u2013 December [[1998 in comics|1998]]\n|issues=\n|main_char_team=[[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Backlash]], Taboo, [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], Ferrian, Vigor, Brawl, Styrian, Alea, Azrum, Geist, [[Jet (Wildstorm)|Crimson]] (unofficial member)\n|writers=\n|artists=\n|pencillers=\n|inkers=\n|letterers=\n|colorists=\n|creative_team_month=\n|creative_team_year=\n|creators=[[Sean Ruffner]], [[Brett Booth]]\n|TPB=\n|ISBN=\n}}\n'''''Wildcore''''' was an [[American comic book]] series created and co-written by writer [[Sean Ruffner]] and artist [[Brett Booth]] that debuted in [[1997 in comics|1997]].
