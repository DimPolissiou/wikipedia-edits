It was called ''An Act to Regulate the Carrying of Passengers in Merchant Vessels''. The ''Act'' limited the number of passengers who could be carried on a ship, regulated the amount of space allocated to them, and required that passengers be supplied with adequate sustenance on the voyage. The 1828 ''Act'' is now recognized as the foundation of British colonial emigration legislation.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2111.01-e.html Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience] - \"Right of Passage\" at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\nCanadian citizenship was originally created under the Immigration Act, 1910, to designate those British subjects who were domiciled in Canada. All other British subjects required permission to land. A separate status of \"Canadian national\" was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, which was defined as being a Canadian citizen as defined above, their wives, and any children (fathered by such citizens) who had not yet landed in Canada. After the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution. Because of this, Canadians\u2014and others living in countries that became known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s\u2014were known as ''subjects of the Crown''. However, in legal documents, the term \"British subject\" continued to be used.\n\nCanada was the second nation in the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to establish its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]]. This took effect on January 1, 1947. To acquire Canadian citizenship on 1 January 1947, one generally had to be a [[British subject]] on that date, an Indian or Eskimo, or had to have been admitted to Canada as landed immigrants before that date. A ''British subject'' at that time was anyone from the UK or its colonies, or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country. Acquisition and loss of British subject status before 1947 was determined by [[United Kingdom]] law (see [[History of British nationality law]]).\n\nOn February 15, 1977, Canada removed restrictions on dual citizenship. Many of the provisions to acquire or lose Canadian citizenship that existed under the 1946 legislation were repealed. Canadian citizens are in general no longer subject to involuntary loss of citizenship, barring revocation on the grounds of immigration fraud or criminality. The term \"'''Canadians of convenience'''\" was popularized by Canadian politician [[Garth Turner]] in 2006 in conjunction with the evacuation of [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens from [[Lebanon]] during the [[2006 Israel\u2013Lebanon conflict]].  It refers to people with [[multiple citizenship]] who immigrated to Canada, met the residency requirement to obtain citizenship, obtained [[Canadian citizenship]], and moved back to their original home country while maintaining their Canadian citizenship, with those who support the term claiming they do so as a [[safety net]].\n\n==Regional history==\n\n===The Atlantic area of Canada===\n{{See also|History of Nova Scotia|History of Newfoundland and Labrador|History of New Brunswick|History of Prince Edward Island}}\n[[File:Authentic Viking recreation crop2.jpg|left|230px|thumb|[[L'Anse aux Meadows]] on the island of Newfoundland, site of a [[Norsemen]] colony.]]\nThere are a number of reports of contact made before Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. The case of [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Viking contact]] is supported by the remains of a [[Viking]] settlement in [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], although there is no direct proof this was the place [[Iceland]]ic [[Norsemen|Norseman]] [[Leif Ericson|Leifur Eir\u00edksson]] referred to as [[Vinland]] around the year 1000.<!--could have been Helluland or Markland, too-->\n\nThe presence of [[Basques|Basque]] cod fishermen and whalers, just a few years after Columbus, has also been cited, with at least nine fishing outposts having been established on [[Labrador]] and Newfoundland. The largest of these settlements was the [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] station, with an estimated 900 people. [[Basque people|Basque]] [[whaler]]s may have begun fishing the [[Grand Banks]] as early as the 15th century.\n\nThe next European explorer acknowledged as landing in what is now Canada was [[John Cabot]], who landed somewhere on the coast of North America (probably Newfoundland or [[Cape Breton Island]]) in 1497 and claimed it for King [[Henry VII of England]]. Portuguese and Spanish explorers also visited Canada, but it was the French who first began to explore further inland and set up colonies, beginning with [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534. Under [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]], the first French settlement was made in 1604 in the region of New France known as [[Acadia|Acadie]] on Isle Sainte-Croix (which now belongs to Maine) in the Bay of Fundy.  That winter was particularly long and harsh and about half of the settlers that had accompanied Sieur de Mons died of scurvy.  The following year they decided to move to a better sheltered area, establishing a new settlement at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port-Royal]]<!-- This originally said 'in what is now Cape Breton', but Port-Royal still exists as a National Historic site and is actually found in the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia. Simply removed the part that was incorrect -->.  In 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]], established a settlement at Donnacona; it would later grow to become [[Quebec City]]. The French claimed Canada as their own and 6,000 settlers arrived, settling along the St. Lawrence and in the [[Maritimes]]. Britain also had a presence in Newfoundland and, with the advent of settlements, claimed the south of Nova Scotia as well as the areas around the [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThe first contact with the Europeans was disastrous for the first peoples. Explorers and traders brought European diseases, such as [[smallpox]], which killed off entire villages. Relations varied between the settlers and the Natives. The French befriended the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] peoples and entered into a mutually beneficial trading relationship with them. The [[Iroquois]], however, became dedicated opponents of the French and warfare between the two was unrelenting, especially as the British armed the Iroquois in an effort to weaken the French.\n\n===Quebec===\n{{See also|History of Quebec}}\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain on 1612]]\nAfter [[Samuel de Champlain]]'s founding of [[Quebec City]] in 1608, it became the [[capital city|capital]] of [[New France]]. While the coastal [[Community|communities]] were based upon the [[cod]] [[fishery]], the economy of the interior revolved around [[beaver]] [[fur]], which was popular in Europe. French ''voyageurs'' would travel into the hinterlands and trade with the natives. The voyageurs ranged throughout what is today Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba trading guns, gunpowder, textiles and other European manufacturing goods with the natives for furs. The fur trade encouraged only a small population, however, as minimal labour was required. Encouraging settlement was always difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1760 [[New France]] had a population of only some 70,000.\n\nNew France had other problems besides low immigration. The [[France|French]] [[government]] had little interest or ability in supporting its colony and it was mostly left to its own devices. The economy was primitive and much of the population was involved in little more than subsistence agriculture. The colonists also engaged in a long-running series of [[French Iroquois Wars|wars with the Iroquois]].\n\n===Ontario===\n{{See also|History of Ontario}}\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] explored Ontario from 1610 to 1612.

Canada became a nation in 1867, Rupert's Land became absorbed into the [[North-West Territories]]. To encourage [[British Columbia]] to join the [[confederation]], a [[transcontinental railway]] was proposed. The railway companies felt it was not feasible to lay track over land where there was no settlement. The fur trading era was declining; as the [[American bison|buffalo]] population disappeared, so too did the nomadic buffalo hunters, which presented a possibility to increase agricultural settlement. Agricultural possibilities were first expounded by [[Henry Youle Hind]].

The [[Red River Colony]] population of [[Manitoba]] allowed it to become a [[province]] in 1870. In the 1880s less than 1000 non-Aboriginal people resided out west. The government's immigration policy was a huge success, the [[North-West Territories]] grew to a population of 56,446 in 1881 and almost doubled to 98,967 in 1891, and exponentially jumped to 211,649 by 1901.<ref name=popu>[http://www.townofdavidson.com/main/main_history.html Home Page \u2013 Town of Davidson], URL accessed 26 November 2006</ref>  Ethnic [[Bloc Settlements]]<ref name=ethni>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~cansk/Saskatchewan/history.html Saskatchewan Gen Web Project \u2013 SGW \u2013 Saskatchewan Genealogy Roots], URL accessed 26 November 2006</ref> dotted the prairies, as language groupings settled together on soil types of the Canadian western prairie similar to agricultural land of their homeland. In this way immigration was successful; new settlements could grow because of common communication and learned agricultural methods.  Canada's [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] [[transcontinental railway]] was finished in 1885. Immigration briefly ceased to the West during the [[North West Rebellion]] of 1885. Various investors and companies were involved in the sale of railway (and some non railway) lands. Sifton himself may have been involved as an investor in some of these ventures.<ref>[http://www.indianclaims.ca/pdf/FNLS_Chapter%202_eng.pdf First Nation Land Surrenders on the Prairies 1896\u20131911] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929022254/http://www.indianclaims.ca/pdf/FNLS_Chapter%202_eng.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} Peggy Martin-McGuire, Ch 2, Land and Colonization Companies, Indian Claims Commission, URL accessed January 11, 2007.</ref> Populations of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] were eligible for provincial status in 1905. Immigration continued to increase through to the roaring twenties. A mass exodus affected the prairies during the ''dirty thirties'' depression years and the prairies have never again regained the impetus of the immigration wave seen in the early 20th century.\n\n===Immigration to British Columbia===\n{{see also|History of British Columbia}}\nUntil the railway, immigration to British Columbia was either via sea, or \u2013 once the [[British Columbia gold rushes|gold rushes]] were under way \u2013 via overland travel from California and other parts of the US, as there was no usable route westward beyond the Rockies, and travel on the Prairies and across the Canadian Shield was still water-borne.  BC's very small early non-native population was dominantly French-Canadian and Metis fur-company employees, their British (largely Scottish) administrators and bosses, and a population of Kanakas (Hawaiians) in the company's employ, as well as members of various Iroquoian peoples, also in the service of the fur company.  The non-local native population of the British Pacific was in the 150\u2013300 range until the advent of the [[Fraser Gold Rush]] in 1857, when Victoria's population swelled to 30,000 in four weeks and towns of 10,000 and more appeared at hitherto-remote locations on the Mainland, at [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]], and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet (then called Cayoosh Flat)]].  This wave of settlement was near-entirely from California, and was approximately one-third each American, Chinese and various Europeans and others; nearly all had been in California for many years, including the early Canadians and Maritimers who made the journey north to the new Gold Colony, as British Columbia was often called.\n\nOne group of about 60, called the [[Overlanders of '62]], did make the journey from Canada via Rupert's Land during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], though they were the exception to the rule.  An earlier attempt to move some of the settlers of the Selkirk Colony ended in disaster at [[Dalles des Morts]], near present-day [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]].  Early immigration to British Columbia was from all nations, largely via California, and included Germans, Scandinavians, Maritimers, Australians, Poles, Italians, French, Belgians and others, as well as Chinese and Americans who were the largest groups to arrive in the years around the time of the founding of the Mainland Colony in 1858.  Most of the early Americans left in the early 1860s because of the US Civil War as well as in pursuit of other gold rushes in Idaho, Colorado and Nevada, though Americans remained a major component in the settler population ever since.  During the 1860s, in conjunction with the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] and agitation to join Canada, more and more Canadians (including the Overlanders, who became influential) arrived and became a force in the local polity, which hitherto had been dominated by Britons favouring separate rule, and helped contribute towards the agenda for annexation with Canada.  After the opening of the CPR, a new wave of immigration led not just to the creation of Vancouver and other newer urban settlements, but also to the settlement of numerous regions in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]], especially the [[Okanagan]], [[Boundary Country|Boundary]], [[Shuswap Country|Shuswap]], and [[Kootenays]].\nA similar wave of settlement and development accompanied the opening of the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (today the CNR) through the Central Interior, which was also the impetus for the creation of the city of Prince George and the port of Prince Rupert.<!--also PGE re settlement of the Cariboo rail towns...more to come re the Peace Country, for which immigration history is somewhat different, likewise on waves of temporary settlement in the Cassiar and other goldfields-->\n\n====Head Tax and Chinese Immigration Act of 1923====\n{{See also|Chinese Head Tax|History of Chinese immigration to Canada}}\nThe first immigrants from China to Canada came from California to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in British Columbia, beginning in 1858; immigrants directly from China did not arrive until 1859.  The Chinese were a significant part of nearly all the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] and most towns in BC had large Chinese populations, often a third of the total or more.  Chinese labourers were hired to help with the construction of the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]] and [[Alexandra Bridge]] as well as the [[Douglas Road]] and other routes.  Chinese miners, merchants and ranchers enjoyed full rights to mineral tenure and land alienation and in some areas became the mainstay of the local economy for decades.  Chinese, for instance, owned 60% of the land in the [[Lillooet Land District]] in the 1870s and 1880s<!--ref is J. Morton and also Mark S. Wade but also others--> and held the majority of working claims on the Fraser River and in other areas. <!--cite is Cole Harris, The resettlement of British Columbia-->The next wave of immigrants from China were labourers brought in to help build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|C.P.R.]] [[transcontinental railway]] but many defected to the goldfields of the [[Cariboo]] and other mining districts. In the year the railway was completed the [[Chinese Immigration Act]] of 1885 was enacted, and a head tax was levied to control the ongoing influx of labour, although immigration continued as corporate interests in BC preferred to hire the cheaper labour made available to them by Chinese labour contractors<!--ref is Morton and others-->; Chinese labour was brought in by the Dunsmuir coal interests used to break the back of strikers at [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] in the [[Comox Valley]], which then became one of BC's largest Chinatowns as white workers formerly resident there had been [[Ginger Goodwin|displaced by armed force]].<!--Chinese willingness to undercut the pay expected by other groups is cited as a major reason for the intensity of labour union organizing in BC in the 00-decade, but I'll find a cite for that before adding it-->\n[[File:Komogata Maru LAC a034014 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Sikhs aboard the ''Komagata Maru'' in Vancouver's [[Burrard Inlet]], 1914]]\n\n====Indian Immigration and Continuous Journey Regulation of 1908====\n{{See also|Continuous journey regulation|Komagata Maru Incident}}\nThe [[Government of Canada|Canadian government's]] first attempt to restrict immigration from [[India]] was to pass an [[order-in-council]] on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who \"in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior\" did not \"come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a ''continuous journey'' and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In practice this applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in [[Japan]] or [[Hawaii]]. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting massive numbers of immigrants (over 400,000 in 1913 alone &ndash; a figure that remains unsurpassed to this day), almost all of whom came from Europe. Though [[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh]], was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' in January 1914,<ref>Johnston, Hugh J.M., The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 26</ref> he continued with his purported goal of challenging these exclusion laws in order to have a better life. The ''Komagata Maru'', a Japanese steamship that sailed from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Shanghai]], China; [[Yokohama]], Japan; and then to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, in 1914, carried 376 passengers from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[India]]. The passengers were not allowed to land in Canada and the ship was forced to return to India.  The passengers consisted of 340 [[Sikhs]], 24 [[Muslims]], and 12 [[Hindus]], all [[British subject]]s.  This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century involving exclusion laws in Canada and the United States designed to keep out immigrants of Asian origin.\n\n==Scandinavian colonists and settlement==\nScandinavians were a strong contingent of the original arrivals from California and distinguished themselves in the establishment of the early timber industry and especially in the foundations of the commercial fishery. Later on, semi-utopian and religious colonies arrived at certain places \u2013 [[Cape Scott (Canada)|Cape Scott]] and [[Holberg, British Columbia]] and nearby areas for the [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Sointula, British Columbia|Sointula]] and [[Webster's Corners, British Columbia|Websters Corners]] for the [[Finnish people|Finns]], and [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]] and locations nearby, such as [[Tallheo, British Columbia|Tallheo]].  All originally socialist or Christian attempts at new societies, these wound up breaking up though the populations such as the Norwegians at Bella Coola continued on in the fishery, building and running canneries (of which Tallheo was one).\n\n==German colonists and settlement==\nGerman colonists, like the Scandinavians, were among the earliest to arrive from California and established themselves beyond mining in areas such as ranching and construction and specialized trades.  Until World War I, Vancouver was a major centre of German investment and social life and German was commonly heard on the city's streets and bars.  They remained the largest non-British group in the province until eclipsed in that capacity by the Chinese in the 1980s.\n\n==Doukhobor settlement and communities==\nThe Doukhobor people were assisted in their immigration by Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] who admired them for their collectarian lifestyle and beliefs and ardent pacifism and freedom from materialism. Originally settled in Saskatchewan, and restive of the government's desire to send their children to public school and other matters, they migrated ''en masse'' to British Columbia to settle in the [[West Kootenay]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary]] regions.\n\n==The Great Migration of Canada==\n{{main|Great Migration of Canada}}\nThe Great Migration of Canada (also known as the Great Migration from Britain) was a period of high [[immigration to Canada]] from 1815 to 1850, involving over 800,000 immigrants chiefly from the British Isles. Unlike the later 19th century/ early 20th century when organized immigration schemes brought in much of the new immigrants to Canada, this period of immigration was demand driven based on the need for infrastructure labour in the burgeoning colonies, filling new rural settlements and poor conditions in some source places, such the Highland Clearances in Scotland and later, the Irish Potato famine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linksnorth.com/canada-history/thecolonies.html |title=The History of Canada and Canadians \u2013 Colonies Grow Up |publisher=Linksnorth.com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Though Europe was in an overall sense becoming richer through the [[Industrial Revolution]], steep [[population growth]] made the relative number of jobs low, and overcrowded conditions forcing many to look to [[North America]] for economic success.<ref>[http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204072447/http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 |date=December 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Immigration to the West==\nAttempts to form permanent settlement colonies west of the [[Great Lakes]] were beset by difficulty and isolation until the building of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the second of the two [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellions]].  Despite the railway making the region more accessible there were fear that a tide of settlers from the United States might overrun British territory. In 1896, Minister of the Interior [[Clifford Sifton]] launched a program of settlement with offices and advertising in the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  This began a major wave of railway-based immigration which created the farms, towns and cities of the Prairie provinces.\n\n==Third wave (1890\u20131920) and fourth wave (1940s\u20131960s)==\n[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The government promoted cheap wheat lands in the Prairies. 1898]]\nThe third wave of immigration coming mostly from continental Europe peaked prior to [[World War I]], between 1911\u20131913 (over 400,000 in 1912), many from Eastern or Southern Europe. The fourth wave came from Europe after the Second World War, peaking at 282,000 in 1957. Many were from Italy and Portugal. [[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] was an influential port for European immigration; Pier 21 received 471,940 Italians between 1928 until it ceased operations in 1971, making [[Italian Canadians|Italians]] the third largest ethnic group to immigrate to Canada during that time period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816000332/https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Together, they made Canada a more multi-ethnic country with substantial non-British or non-French European elements. For example, [[Ukrainian Canadians]] accounted for the largest Ukrainian population outside Ukraine and Russia. The Church of England took up the role of introducing British values to farmers newly arrived on the prairies. In practice, they clung to their traditional religious affiliations.<ref>David Smith, ''Instilling British Values in the Prairie Provinces\", ''Prairie Forum'' 6#2 (1981): pp. 129\u201341.</ref>\n\nPeriods of low immigration have also occurred: international movement was very difficult during the world wars, and there was a lack of jobs \"pulling\" workers out of Canada during the [[Great Depression in Canada]].\n\nCanadianization was a high priority for new arrivals lacking a British cultural background.<ref>Kent Fedorowich, \"Restocking the British World: Empire Migration and Anglo-Canadian Relations, 1919\u201330,\" ''Britain and the World'' (Aug 2016) 9#2 pp 236-269, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.3366/brw.2016.0239 open access</ref> Immigrants from Britain were given highest priority.<ref>Janice Cavell, \"The Imperial Race and the Immigration Sieve: The Canadian Debate on Assisted British Migration and Empire Settlement, 1900\u201330\", ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 34#3 (2006): pp. 345\u201367.</ref>  There was no special effort to attract Francophone immigrants.

This was largely influenced in 1976 when the Immigration Act was revised and this continued to be official government policy. During the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government, immigration levels were increased. By the late 1980s, the '''fifth wave''' of immigration has maintained with slight fluctuations since (225,000\u2013275,000 annually).

It was called ''An Act to Regulate the Carrying of Passengers in Merchant Vessels''. The ''Act'' limited the number of passengers who could be carried on a ship, regulated the amount of space allocated to them, and required that passengers be supplied with adequate sustenance on the voyage. The 1828 ''Act'' is now recognized as the foundation of British colonial emigration legislation.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2111.01-e.html Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience] - \"Right of Passage\" at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\nCanadian citizenship was originally created under the Immigration Act, 1910, to designate those British subjects who were domiciled in Canada. All other British subjects required permission to land. A separate status of \"Canadian national\" was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, which was defined as being a Canadian citizen as defined above, their wives, and any children (fathered by such citizens) who had not yet landed in Canada. After the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution. Because of this, Canadians\u2014and others living in countries that became known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s\u2014were known as ''subjects of the Crown''. However, in legal documents, the term \"British subject\" continued to be used.\n\nCanada was the second nation in the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to establish its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]]. This took effect on January 1, 1947. To acquire Canadian citizenship on 1 January 1947, one generally had to be a [[British subject]] on that date, an Indian or Eskimo, or had to have been admitted to Canada as landed immigrants before that date. A ''British subject'' at that time was anyone from the UK or its colonies, or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country. Acquisition and loss of British subject status before 1947 was determined by [[United Kingdom]] law (see [[History of British nationality law]]).\n\nOn February 15, 1977, Canada removed restrictions on dual citizenship. Many of the provisions to acquire or lose Canadian citizenship that existed under the 1946 legislation were repealed. Canadian citizens are in general no longer subject to involuntary loss of citizenship, barring revocation on the grounds of immigration fraud or criminality. The term \"'''Canadians of convenience'''\" was popularized by Canadian politician [[Garth Turner]] in 2006 in conjunction with the evacuation of [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens from [[Lebanon]] during the [[2006 Israel\u2013Lebanon conflict]].  It refers to people with [[multiple citizenship]] who immigrated to Canada, met the residency requirement to obtain citizenship, obtained [[Canadian citizenship]], and moved back to their original home country while maintaining their Canadian citizenship, with those who support the term claiming they do so as a [[safety net]].\n\n==Regional history==\n\n===The Atlantic area of Canada===\n{{See also|History of Nova Scotia|History of Newfoundland and Labrador|History of New Brunswick|History of Prince Edward Island}}\n[[File:Authentic Viking recreation crop2.jpg|left|230px|thumb|[[L'Anse aux Meadows]] on the island of Newfoundland, site of a [[Norsemen]] colony.]]\nThere are a number of reports of contact made before Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. The case of [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Viking contact]] is supported by the remains of a [[Viking]] settlement in [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], although there is no direct proof this was the place [[Iceland]]ic [[Norsemen|Norseman]] [[Leif Ericson|Leifur Eir\u00edksson]] referred to as [[Vinland]] around the year 1000.<!--could have been Helluland or Markland, too-->\n\nThe presence of [[Basques|Basque]] cod fishermen and whalers, just a few years after Columbus, has also been cited, with at least nine fishing outposts having been established on [[Labrador]] and Newfoundland. The largest of these settlements was the [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] station, with an estimated 900 people. [[Basque people|Basque]] [[whaler]]s may have begun fishing the [[Grand Banks]] as early as the 15th century.\n\nThe next European explorer acknowledged as landing in what is now Canada was [[John Cabot]], who landed somewhere on the coast of North America (probably Newfoundland or [[Cape Breton Island]]) in 1497 and claimed it for King [[Henry VII of England]]. Portuguese and Spanish explorers also visited Canada, but it was the French who first began to explore further inland and set up colonies, beginning with [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534. Under [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]], the first French settlement was made in 1604 in the region of New France known as [[Acadia|Acadie]] on Isle Sainte-Croix (which now belongs to Maine) in the Bay of Fundy.  That winter was particularly long and harsh and about half of the settlers that had accompanied Sieur de Mons died of scurvy.  The following year they decided to move to a better sheltered area, establishing a new settlement at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port-Royal]]<!-- This originally said 'in what is now Cape Breton', but Port-Royal still exists as a National Historic site and is actually found in the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia. Simply removed the part that was incorrect -->.  In 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]], established a settlement at Donnacona; it would later grow to become [[Quebec City]]. The French claimed Canada as their own and 6,000 settlers arrived, settling along the St. Lawrence and in the [[Maritimes]]. Britain also had a presence in Newfoundland and, with the advent of settlements, claimed the south of Nova Scotia as well as the areas around the [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThe first contact with the Europeans was disastrous for the first peoples. Explorers and traders brought European diseases, such as [[smallpox]], which killed off entire villages. Relations varied between the settlers and the Natives. The French befriended the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] peoples and entered into a mutually beneficial trading relationship with them. The [[Iroquois]], however, became dedicated opponents of the French and warfare between the two was unrelenting, especially as the British armed the Iroquois in an effort to weaken the French.\n\n===Quebec===\n{{See also|History of Quebec}}\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain on 1612]]\nAfter [[Samuel de Champlain]]'s founding of [[Quebec City]] in 1608, it became the [[capital city|capital]] of [[New France]]. While the coastal [[Community|communities]] were based upon the [[cod]] [[fishery]], the economy of the interior revolved around [[beaver]] [[fur]], which was popular in Europe. French ''voyageurs'' would travel into the hinterlands and trade with the natives. The voyageurs ranged throughout what is today Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba trading guns, gunpowder, textiles and other European manufacturing goods with the natives for furs. The fur trade encouraged only a small population, however, as minimal labour was required. Encouraging settlement was always difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1760 [[New France]] had a population of only some 70,000.\n\nNew France had other problems besides low immigration. The [[France|French]] [[government]] had little interest or ability in supporting its colony and it was mostly left to its own devices. The economy was primitive and much of the population was involved in little more than subsistence agriculture. The colonists also engaged in a long-running series of [[French Iroquois Wars|wars with the Iroquois]].\n\n===Ontario===\n{{See also|History of Ontario}}\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] explored Ontario from 1610 to 1612. In 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited Lake Huron, after which French [[missionary|missionaries]] established outposts in the region.\n\n===Immigration to the Prairie Provinces===\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of Saskatchewan|History of Manitoba}}\n\n[[File:Ruperts land.svg|left|thumb|Rupert's Land, showing location of [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]]]]\nIn the 18th to 19th century, the only immigration western Canada or [[Rupert's Land]] saw was early [[French Canadian]] [[North West Company]] [[fur traders]] from eastern Canada, and the Scots, English Adventurers and Explorers representing the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] who arrived via [[Hudson Bay]]. Canada became a nation in 1867, Rupert's Land became absorbed into the [[North-West Territories]]. To encourage [[British Columbia]] to join the [[confederation]], a [[transcontinental railway]] was proposed. The railway companies felt it was not feasible to lay track over land where there was no settlement. The fur trading era was declining; as the [[American bison|buffalo]] population disappeared, so too did the nomadic buffalo hunters, which presented a possibility to increase agricultural settlement. Agricultural possibilities were first expounded by [[Henry Youle Hind]].

The [[Red River Colony]] population of [[Manitoba]] allowed it to become a [[province]] in 1870. In the 1880s less than 1000 non-Aboriginal people resided out west. The government's immigration policy was a huge success, the [[North-West Territories]] grew to a population of 56,446 in 1881 and almost doubled to 98,967 in 1891, and exponentially jumped to 211,649 by 1901.<ref name=popu>[http://www.townofdavidson.com/main/main_history.html Home Page \u2013 Town of Davidson], URL accessed 26 November 2006</ref>  Ethnic [[Bloc Settlements]]<ref name=ethni>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~cansk/Saskatchewan/history.html Saskatchewan Gen Web Project \u2013 SGW \u2013 Saskatchewan Genealogy Roots], URL accessed 26 November 2006</ref> dotted the prairies, as language groupings settled together on soil types of the Canadian western prairie similar to agricultural land of their homeland. In this way immigration was successful; new settlements could grow because of common communication and learned agricultural methods.  Canada's [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] [[transcontinental railway]] was finished in 1885. Immigration briefly ceased to the West during the [[North West Rebellion]] of 1885. Various investors and companies were involved in the sale of railway (and some non railway) lands. Sifton himself may have been involved as an investor in some of these ventures.<ref>[http://www.indianclaims.ca/pdf/FNLS_Chapter%202_eng.pdf First Nation Land Surrenders on the Prairies 1896\u20131911] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929022254/http://www.indianclaims.ca/pdf/FNLS_Chapter%202_eng.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} Peggy Martin-McGuire, Ch 2, Land and Colonization Companies, Indian Claims Commission, URL accessed January 11, 2007.</ref> Populations of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] were eligible for provincial status in 1905. Immigration continued to increase through to the roaring twenties. A mass exodus affected the prairies during the ''dirty thirties'' depression years and the prairies have never again regained the impetus of the immigration wave seen in the early 20th century.\n\n===Immigration to British Columbia===\n{{see also|History of British Columbia}}\nUntil the railway, immigration to British Columbia was either via sea, or \u2013 once the [[British Columbia gold rushes|gold rushes]] were under way \u2013 via overland travel from California and other parts of the US, as there was no usable route westward beyond the Rockies, and travel on the Prairies and across the Canadian Shield was still water-borne.  BC's very small early non-native population was dominantly French-Canadian and Metis fur-company employees, their British (largely Scottish) administrators and bosses, and a population of Kanakas (Hawaiians) in the company's employ, as well as members of various Iroquoian peoples, also in the service of the fur company.  The non-local native population of the British Pacific was in the 150\u2013300 range until the advent of the [[Fraser Gold Rush]] in 1857, when Victoria's population swelled to 30,000 in four weeks and towns of 10,000 and more appeared at hitherto-remote locations on the Mainland, at [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]], and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet (then called Cayoosh Flat)]].  This wave of settlement was near-entirely from California, and was approximately one-third each American, Chinese and various Europeans and others; nearly all had been in California for many years, including the early Canadians and Maritimers who made the journey north to the new Gold Colony, as British Columbia was often called.\n\nOne group of about 60, called the [[Overlanders of '62]], did make the journey from Canada via Rupert's Land during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], though they were the exception to the rule.  An earlier attempt to move some of the settlers of the Selkirk Colony ended in disaster at [[Dalles des Morts]], near present-day [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]].  Early immigration to British Columbia was from all nations, largely via California, and included Germans, Scandinavians, Maritimers, Australians, Poles, Italians, French, Belgians and others, as well as Chinese and Americans who were the largest groups to arrive in the years around the time of the founding of the Mainland Colony in 1858.  Most of the early Americans left in the early 1860s because of the US Civil War as well as in pursuit of other gold rushes in Idaho, Colorado and Nevada, though Americans remained a major component in the settler population ever since.  During the 1860s, in conjunction with the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] and agitation to join Canada, more and more Canadians (including the Overlanders, who became influential) arrived and became a force in the local polity, which hitherto had been dominated by Britons favouring separate rule, and helped contribute towards the agenda for annexation with Canada.  After the opening of the CPR, a new wave of immigration led not just to the creation of Vancouver and other newer urban settlements, but also to the settlement of numerous regions in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]], especially the [[Okanagan]], [[Boundary Country|Boundary]], [[Shuswap Country|Shuswap]], and [[Kootenays]].\nA similar wave of settlement and development accompanied the opening of the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (today the CNR) through the Central Interior, which was also the impetus for the creation of the city of Prince George and the port of Prince Rupert.<!--also PGE re settlement of the Cariboo rail towns...more to come re the Peace Country, for which immigration history is somewhat different, likewise on waves of temporary settlement in the Cassiar and other goldfields-->\n\n====Head Tax and Chinese Immigration Act of 1923====\n{{See also|Chinese Head Tax|History of Chinese immigration to Canada}}\nThe first immigrants from China to Canada came from California to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in British Columbia, beginning in 1858; immigrants directly from China did not arrive until 1859.  The Chinese were a significant part of nearly all the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] and most towns in BC had large Chinese populations, often a third of the total or more.  Chinese labourers were hired to help with the construction of the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]] and [[Alexandra Bridge]] as well as the [[Douglas Road]] and other routes.  Chinese miners, merchants and ranchers enjoyed full rights to mineral tenure and land alienation and in some areas became the mainstay of the local economy for decades.  Chinese, for instance, owned 60% of the land in the [[Lillooet Land District]] in the 1870s and 1880s<!--ref is J. Morton and also Mark S. Wade but also others--> and held the majority of working claims on the Fraser River and in other areas. <!--cite is Cole Harris, The resettlement of British Columbia-->The next wave of immigrants from China were labourers brought in to help build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|C.P.R.]] [[transcontinental railway]] but many defected to the goldfields of the [[Cariboo]] and other mining districts. In the year the railway was completed the [[Chinese Immigration Act]] of 1885 was enacted, and a head tax was levied to control the ongoing influx of labour, although immigration continued as corporate interests in BC preferred to hire the cheaper labour made available to them by Chinese labour contractors<!--ref is Morton and others-->; Chinese labour was brought in by the Dunsmuir coal interests used to break the back of strikers at [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] in the [[Comox Valley]], which then became one of BC's largest Chinatowns as white workers formerly resident there had been [[Ginger Goodwin|displaced by armed force]].<!--Chinese willingness to undercut the pay expected by other groups is cited as a major reason for the intensity of labour union organizing in BC in the 00-decade, but I'll find a cite for that before adding it-->\n[[File:Komogata Maru LAC a034014 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Sikhs aboard the ''Komagata Maru'' in Vancouver's [[Burrard Inlet]], 1914]]\n\n====Indian Immigration and Continuous Journey Regulation of 1908====\n{{See also|Continuous journey regulation|Komagata Maru Incident}}\nThe [[Government of Canada|Canadian government's]] first attempt to restrict immigration from [[India]] was to pass an [[order-in-council]] on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who \"in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior\" did not \"come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a ''continuous journey'' and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In practice this applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in [[Japan]] or [[Hawaii]]. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting massive numbers of immigrants (over 400,000 in 1913 alone &ndash; a figure that remains unsurpassed to this day), almost all of whom came from Europe. Though [[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh]], was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' in January 1914,<ref>Johnston, Hugh J.M., The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 26</ref> he continued with his purported goal of challenging these exclusion laws in order to have a better life. The ''Komagata Maru'', a Japanese steamship that sailed from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Shanghai]], China; [[Yokohama]], Japan; and then to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, in 1914, carried 376 passengers from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[India]]. The passengers were not allowed to land in Canada and the ship was forced to return to India.  The passengers consisted of 340 [[Sikhs]], 24 [[Muslims]], and 12 [[Hindus]], all [[British subject]]s.  This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century involving exclusion laws in Canada and the United States designed to keep out immigrants of Asian origin.\n\n==Scandinavian colonists and settlement==\nScandinavians were a strong contingent of the original arrivals from California and distinguished themselves in the establishment of the early timber industry and especially in the foundations of the commercial fishery. Later on, semi-utopian and religious colonies arrived at certain places \u2013 [[Cape Scott (Canada)|Cape Scott]] and [[Holberg, British Columbia]] and nearby areas for the [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Sointula, British Columbia|Sointula]] and [[Webster's Corners, British Columbia|Websters Corners]] for the [[Finnish people|Finns]], and [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]] and locations nearby, such as [[Tallheo, British Columbia|Tallheo]].  All originally socialist or Christian attempts at new societies, these wound up breaking up though the populations such as the Norwegians at Bella Coola continued on in the fishery, building and running canneries (of which Tallheo was one).\n\n==German colonists and settlement==\nGerman colonists, like the Scandinavians, were among the earliest to arrive from California and established themselves beyond mining in areas such as ranching and construction and specialized trades.  Until World War I, Vancouver was a major centre of German investment and social life and German was commonly heard on the city's streets and bars.  They remained the largest non-British group in the province until eclipsed in that capacity by the Chinese in the 1980s.\n\n==Doukhobor settlement and communities==\nThe Doukhobor people were assisted in their immigration by Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] who admired them for their collectarian lifestyle and beliefs and ardent pacifism and freedom from materialism. Originally settled in Saskatchewan, and restive of the government's desire to send their children to public school and other matters, they migrated ''en masse'' to British Columbia to settle in the [[West Kootenay]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary]] regions.\n\n==The Great Migration of Canada==\n{{main|Great Migration of Canada}}\nThe Great Migration of Canada (also known as the Great Migration from Britain) was a period of high [[immigration to Canada]] from 1815 to 1850, involving over 800,000 immigrants chiefly from the British Isles. Unlike the later 19th century/ early 20th century when organized immigration schemes brought in much of the new immigrants to Canada, this period of immigration was demand driven based on the need for infrastructure labour in the burgeoning colonies, filling new rural settlements and poor conditions in some source places, such the Highland Clearances in Scotland and later, the Irish Potato famine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linksnorth.com/canada-history/thecolonies.html |title=The History of Canada and Canadians \u2013 Colonies Grow Up |publisher=Linksnorth.com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Though Europe was in an overall sense becoming richer through the [[Industrial Revolution]], steep [[population growth]] made the relative number of jobs low, and overcrowded conditions forcing many to look to [[North America]] for economic success.<ref>[http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204072447/http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 |date=December 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Immigration to the West==\nAttempts to form permanent settlement colonies west of the [[Great Lakes]] were beset by difficulty and isolation until the building of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the second of the two [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellions]].  Despite the railway making the region more accessible there were fear that a tide of settlers from the United States might overrun British territory. In 1896, Minister of the Interior [[Clifford Sifton]] launched a program of settlement with offices and advertising in the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  This began a major wave of railway-based immigration which created the farms, towns and cities of the Prairie provinces.\n\n==Third wave (1890\u20131920) and fourth wave (1940s\u20131960s)==\n[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The government promoted cheap wheat lands in the Prairies. 1898]]\nThe third wave of immigration coming mostly from continental Europe peaked prior to [[World War I]], between 1911\u20131913 (over 400,000 in 1912), many from Eastern or Southern Europe. The fourth wave came from Europe after the Second World War, peaking at 282,000 in 1957. Many were from Italy and Portugal. [[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] was an influential port for European immigration; Pier 21 received 471,940 Italians between 1928 until it ceased operations in 1971, making [[Italian Canadians|Italians]] the third largest ethnic group to immigrate to Canada during that time period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816000332/https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Together, they made Canada a more multi-ethnic country with substantial non-British or non-French European elements. For example, [[Ukrainian Canadians]] accounted for the largest Ukrainian population outside Ukraine and Russia. The Church of England took up the role of introducing British values to farmers newly arrived on the prairies. In practice, they clung to their traditional religious affiliations.<ref>David Smith, ''Instilling British Values in the Prairie Provinces\", ''Prairie Forum'' 6#2 (1981): pp. 129\u201341.</ref>\n\nPeriods of low immigration have also occurred: international movement was very difficult during the world wars, and there was a lack of jobs \"pulling\" workers out of Canada during the [[Great Depression in Canada]].\n\nCanadianization was a high priority for new arrivals lacking a British cultural background.<ref>Kent Fedorowich, \"Restocking the British World: Empire Migration and Anglo-Canadian Relations, 1919\u201330,\" ''Britain and the World'' (Aug 2016) 9#2 pp 236-269, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.3366/brw.2016.0239 open access</ref> Immigrants from Britain were given highest priority.<ref>Janice Cavell, \"The Imperial Race and the Immigration Sieve: The Canadian Debate on Assisted British Migration and Empire Settlement, 1900\u201330\", ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 34#3 (2006): pp. 345\u201367.</ref>  There was no special effort to attract Francophone immigrants.

This was largely influenced in 1976 when the Immigration Act was revised and this continued to be official government policy. During the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government, immigration levels were increased. By the late 1980s, the '''fifth wave''' of immigration has maintained with slight fluctuations since (225,000\u2013275,000 annually).

Hitler mistrusted Georgians because \"the Georgians are not a Turkish people, rather a typical Caucasian tribe, probably even with some [[Nordic race|Nordic]] blood in them...The only ones I consider to be reliable are the pure Muslims, which means the real Turkish nations.\"<ref>[[:de:Helmut Heiber|Helmut Heiber]], [[Gerhard Weinberg|Gerhard L.

Weinberg]], [[David Glantz|David M. Glantz]]. ''Hitler and His Generals: Military Conferences 1942-1945''. Enigma Books: 2013, p. 20</ref>\n\nFaced with a choice between Hitler and Stalin's regimes, members of the Georgian Legion often suffered tragic fates. Notably, during the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]], hundreds of Georgians were killed by the Nazis. Those who survived were, on Moscow's orders, forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union, only to end up perishing in Stalin's [[Gulag]]s.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Wehrmacht]]'s ethnic Georgian Legion was formed from \u00e9migr\u00e9s living in Western Europe after the 1921 [[Soviet invasion of Georgia]], combined with Soviet [[prisoners of war]] of Georgian origin who chose to fight for Germany rather than submit to often brutally poor living conditions in POW camps.\n\n[[File:Shalva Loladze, aka Schalwa Loladse, a Georgian soldier of the German Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Shalva Loladze]], leader of the [[Georgian uprising on Texel|Texel Uprising]]]]\n\nNazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, though they never reached Soviet Georgia. The main Georgian Legion was formed in December 1941. The Georgians trained in [[Ukraine|western Ukraine]] and became operational in the autumn of 1942. At least 30,000 Georgians served in the German armed forces during World War II. The Georgians served in thirteen field [[battalion]]s of up to 800 men, each made up of five [[company (military unit)|companies]]. Georgians were also found in the Wehrmacht's [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] Legion and in other [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] ethnic legions. The Georgian military formations were commanded by [[Shalva Maglakelidze]], [[Mikheil Tsulukidze|Michel-Fridon Zulukidze]], Col. Solomon Nicholas Zaldastani and other officers formerly of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (1918\u201321).\n\nIn addition to this main legion, at the behest of German occupiers in Paris enscounced in the Hotel Lutetia from the spring of 1940, Michel Kedia and Akaki Chavgoulidze, owners of a yoghurt business, began forming units of Georgian emigres living in the French capital.  The men were told they were to assist Germany by conducting surveillance in German factories and performing other non-military tasks like driving trucks of supplies. In return, the Germans promised to restore the independence of Georgia, suppressed by Stalin, Beriia and other Bolsheviks in 1921 and again in 1924. The men were given a short course in anti-sabotage work at a Chateau near Orleans. Following that, however, the recruits actually were organized into three military units and entrained toward eastern Europe.  The units were named for Tamara, a twelfth-century Georgian Queen.  Tamara I consisted of 19 men.  They parachuted into Russia. Most disappeared although four returned to Paris and were arrested in 1944. The first section of Tamara II consisted of 90 men. They left Paris 1 July 1941. About nine survived.  The second section of Tamara II, consisting of 54 men, left Paris 15 July 1941. Approximately 15 resurfaced. The recruits of the Tamara II units milled about in Romania, southern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula.  Some, who became ill, received medical treatment in Vienna or other venues and were allowed to return to Paris. Some fled.  Most were demobilized in the fall of 1942 although they were asked to help suppress Communist uprisings expected at the end of the war. The men were initially given 3,000 francs and their families were given stipends.  [source: Mary Schaeffer Conroy, Collaboration with Germany by Georgians in France during World War II. (Lap-Lambert Academic Press, 2018), pp. 33-43]     \n\nUpon their return to Paris, some of the men in the Tamara units worked for Chalva Odicharia.  He directed \"Bureaus of Purchase.\"  These assisted the German occupation by rooting out and suppressing sabotage, confiscating Jewish properties, and acquiring scarce materials for the Germans.  Odicharia's assistants included 33 Georgians, as well as 7 Russians, 3 Italians, 2 Corsicans, 2 Germans, 1 Alsatian, 1 Tunisian, 1 Portuguese, 1 Martinique resident, 2 Czechs, and 30 French citizens. Two of the assistants were Jews, four were women.

[[Adolf Hitler]] himself was greatly suspicious of the Georgian and other Soviet battalions. This was especially so after some Georgian soldiers of the Wehrmacht deserted and joined local [[Resistance movement]]s across [[Europe]], especially in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Occupied France|France]]. Despite these suspicions, [[Alexander Nikuradze]], [[Michael Achmeteli]], and some other Georgian scholars were held in high esteem in Germany and managed to keep a somewhat favorable treatment of Georgians by the Reich.<ref>Lang, page 259.</ref>\n\nAs a result of Hitler's distrust of ''[[Osttruppen]]'' (\"Eastern Troops\"), some Georgian battalions were moved west to occupation duties in the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Netherlands]]. With the western allies driving into Germany, the 822 Georgian battalion, stationed on the Dutch island of [[Texel]], rebelled against their German overlords. The resulting battle, known as the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]], continued from April 5, 1945 past the general German surrender, until May 20. This event is sometimes described as Europe's last battle.<ref>http://www.historytoday.com/larry-hannant/europe%E2%80%99s-last-battle</ref>\n\nIn accordance with inter-Allied agreements, all Soviet citizens were to be repatriated, by force if necessary, to the Soviet Union. The Soviets treated those who wore German uniforms, such as those in the Georgian Legion, as traitors. They were punished upon their return, with many exiled to [[Siberia]] or [[Central Asia]].<ref>Lang, page 260.</ref>\n\n== List of Georgian units in the Wehrmacht ==\nList of Georgian units in the Wehrmacht (incomplete)\n\n*795 Battalion \"[[Shalva Maglakelidze]]\"\n\nFighting: 1942 in [[North Ossetia]], 1944 in [[Occupied France|France]]\n\n*796 Battalion.\n\nFighting: 1942/43 in [[Tuapse]], [[North Caucasus]]\n\n*797 Battalion \"[[Giorgi Saakadze]]\"\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France\n\n*798 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France 1945 in Germany\n\n*799 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France, 1945 in Germany\n\n*822 Battalion \"[[Tamar of Georgia|Tamara]]\"\n\nFighting: 1943/44/45 in France and on [[Texel]] ([[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Netherlands]])\n\n*823 Battalion\n*824 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1944 in [[Lvov]], [[General Government|Poland]]\n\n* SS Waffengruppe \"Georgien\" was formed on December 11, 1944 and commanded by SS Waffen-Standartenf\u00fchrer Michail Pridon Tsulukidze\n\nThe elite [[Bergmann Battalion]], part of the [[Brandenburgers]] of the German [[Abwehr]] also had a majority of Georgian personnel.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ostlegionen]]\n* [[Tetri Giorgi (organization)|Tetri Giorgi]]\n*[[Bergmann Battalion]]\n* [[Union of Georgian Traditionalists]]\n* [[Georgian Uprising of Texel]]\n* [[The Georgian Legion (1914-1918)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n*[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1962), ''A Modern History of Georgia'', [[London]]: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.\n[Alexander Statiev, At War's Summit: The Red Army and the Struggle for the Caucasus Mountains in World War II.

Hitler mistrusted Georgians because \"the Georgians are not a Turkish people, rather a typical Caucasian tribe, probably even with some [[Nordic race|Nordic]] blood in them...The only ones I consider to be reliable are the pure Muslims, which means the real Turkish nations.\"<ref>[[:de:Helmut Heiber|Helmut Heiber]], [[Gerhard Weinberg|Gerhard L.

Notably, during the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]], hundreds of Georgians were killed by the Nazis. Those who survived were, on Moscow's orders, forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union, only to end up perishing in Stalin's [[Gulag]]s.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Wehrmacht]]'s ethnic Georgian Legion was formed from \u00e9migr\u00e9s living in Western Europe after the 1921 [[Soviet invasion of Georgia]], combined with Soviet [[prisoners of war]] of Georgian origin who chose to fight for Germany rather than submit to often brutally poor living conditions in POW camps.\n\n[[File:Shalva Loladze, aka Schalwa Loladse, a Georgian soldier of the German Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Shalva Loladze]], leader of the [[Georgian uprising on Texel|Texel Uprising]]]]\n\nNazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, though they never reached Soviet Georgia. The main Georgian Legion was formed in December 1941. The Georgians trained in [[Ukraine|western Ukraine]] and became operational in the autumn of 1942. At least 30,000 Georgians served in the German armed forces during World War II. The Georgians served in thirteen field [[battalion]]s of up to 800 men, each made up of five [[company (military unit)|companies]]. Georgians were also found in the Wehrmacht's [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] Legion and in other [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] ethnic legions. The Georgian military formations were commanded by [[Shalva Maglakelidze]], [[Mikheil Tsulukidze|Michel-Fridon Zulukidze]], Col. Solomon Nicholas Zaldastani and other officers formerly of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (1918\u201321).\n\nIn addition to this main legion, at the behest of German occupiers in Paris enscounced in the Hotel Lutetia from the spring of 1940, Michel Kedia and Akaki Chavgoulidze, owners of a yoghurt business, began forming units of Georgian emigres living in the French capital.  The men were told they were to assist Germany by conducting surveillance in German factories and performing other non-military tasks like driving trucks of supplies. In return, the Germans promised to restore the independence of Georgia, suppressed by Stalin, Beriia and other Bolsheviks in 1921 and again in 1924. The men were given a short course in anti-sabotage work at a Chateau near Orleans. Following that, however, the recruits actually were organized into three military units and entrained toward eastern Europe.  The units were named for Tamara, a twelfth-century Georgian Queen.  Tamara I consisted of 19 men.  They parachuted into Russia. Most disappeared although four returned to Paris and were arrested in 1944. The first section of Tamara II consisted of 90 men. They left Paris 1 July 1941. About nine survived.  The second section of Tamara II, consisting of 54 men, left Paris 15 July 1941. Approximately 15 resurfaced. The recruits of the Tamara II units milled about in Romania, southern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula.  Some, who became ill, received medical treatment in Vienna or other venues and were allowed to return to Paris. Some fled.  Most were demobilized in the fall of 1942 although they were asked to help suppress Communist uprisings expected at the end of the war. The men were initially given 3,000 francs and their families were given stipends.  [source: Mary Schaeffer Conroy, Collaboration with Germany by Georgians in France during World War II. (Lap-Lambert Academic Press, 2018), pp. 33-43]     \n\nUpon their return to Paris, some of the men in the Tamara units worked for Chalva Odicharia.  He directed \"Bureaus of Purchase.\"  These assisted the German occupation by rooting out and suppressing sabotage, confiscating Jewish properties, and acquiring scarce materials for the Germans.  Odicharia's assistants included 33 Georgians, as well as 7 Russians, 3 Italians, 2 Corsicans, 2 Germans, 1 Alsatian, 1 Tunisian, 1 Portuguese, 1 Martinique resident, 2 Czechs, and 30 French citizens. Two of the assistants were Jews, four were women.

[[Adolf Hitler]] himself was greatly suspicious of the Georgian and other Soviet battalions. This was especially so after some Georgian soldiers of the Wehrmacht deserted and joined local [[Resistance movement]]s across [[Europe]], especially in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Occupied France|France]]. Despite these suspicions, [[Alexander Nikuradze]], [[Michael Achmeteli]], and some other Georgian scholars were held in high esteem in Germany and managed to keep a somewhat favorable treatment of Georgians by the Reich.<ref>Lang, page 259.</ref>\n\nAs a result of Hitler's distrust of ''[[Osttruppen]]'' (\"Eastern Troops\"), some Georgian battalions were moved west to occupation duties in the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Netherlands]]. With the western allies driving into Germany, the 822 Georgian battalion, stationed on the Dutch island of [[Texel]], rebelled against their German overlords. The resulting battle, known as the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]], continued from April 5, 1945 past the general German surrender, until May 20. This event is sometimes described as Europe's last battle.<ref>http://www.historytoday.com/larry-hannant/europe%E2%80%99s-last-battle</ref>\n\nIn accordance with inter-Allied agreements, all Soviet citizens were to be repatriated, by force if necessary, to the Soviet Union. The Soviets treated those who wore German uniforms, such as those in the Georgian Legion, as traitors. They were punished upon their return, with many exiled to [[Siberia]] or [[Central Asia]].<ref>Lang, page 260.</ref>\n\n== List of Georgian units in the Wehrmacht ==\nList of Georgian units in the Wehrmacht (incomplete)\n\n*795 Battalion \"[[Shalva Maglakelidze]]\"\n\nFighting: 1942 in [[North Ossetia]], 1944 in [[Occupied France|France]]\n\n*796 Battalion.\n\nFighting: 1942/43 in [[Tuapse]], [[North Caucasus]]\n\n*797 Battalion \"[[Giorgi Saakadze]]\"\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France\n\n*798 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France 1945 in Germany\n\n*799 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1943/44 in France, 1945 in Germany\n\n*822 Battalion \"[[Tamar of Georgia|Tamara]]\"\n\nFighting: 1943/44/45 in France and on [[Texel]] ([[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Netherlands]])\n\n*823 Battalion\n*824 Battalion\n\nFighting: 1944 in [[Lvov]], [[General Government|Poland]]\n\n* SS Waffengruppe \"Georgien\" was formed on December 11, 1944 and commanded by SS Waffen-Standartenf\u00fchrer Michail Pridon Tsulukidze\n\nThe elite [[Bergmann Battalion]], part of the [[Brandenburgers]] of the German [[Abwehr]] also had a majority of Georgian personnel.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ostlegionen]]\n* [[Tetri Giorgi (organization)|Tetri Giorgi]]\n*[[Bergmann Battalion]]\n* [[Union of Georgian Traditionalists]]\n* [[Georgian Uprising of Texel]]\n* [[The Georgian Legion (1914-1918)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n*[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1962), ''A Modern History of Georgia'', [[London]]: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.\n[Alexandrer Statiev, At War's Summit: The Red Army and the Struggle for the Caucasus Mountains in World War II.
