In the 17th century Nevers was then a pioneer in imitating Asian ceramic styles in Europe, within some decades followed by all producers of fine wares.  The second half of the 17th century was Nevers' finest period, with several styles being made at the same time, including a grandiose Italianate Court style.<ref>McNab, 20-21; [http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1156287/jardiniere-unknown/ V&A, Nevers] [[Jardiniere]]</ref>   \n\nBy the time of the [[French Revolution]] Nevers wares had ceased to be fashionable and expensive,<ref>Garnier, 274\u2013275</ref> but the relatively crudely painted ''faiences patriotiques'' wares commenting on political events have great interest and charm.<ref>Though not to Garnier, 275, who is very rude about them</ref>  A late 19th-century revival concentrated on high-quality revivalist wares recreating past glories.    \n \n==History==\nThe tradition owes its origin to [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]] (1539\u20131595), a half-French and half Italian politician and courtier who married the heiress of the [[Duke of Nevers|Duchy of Nevers]], which then still gave him great powers in the [[County and Duchy of Nevers]].  He had been born in [[Mantua]], a centre for Italian [[maiolica]], which had already spread to [[Rouen]] and [[Lyons]], and encouraged some Italian potters to move to the city; Giulio Gambin was already in Lyons and the Conrade brothers (Corrado in Italy) came from [[Albisola]], who would found the dynasty that dominated Nevers production for a century.<ref>Coutts, 28; Moon; McNab, 12; Britannica</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=173}}</ref>   \n\nNevers already had a local unglazed pottery industry, and was a very suitable location for making faience. The city was near deposits of excellent pottery clay, an exceptionally good type of sand for making [[ceramic glaze]], forests for wood for the kilns, and was on the major [[Loire]] river.  The earliest dated piece by the Italians is from 1587.<ref>Estienne, 46</ref> \n\nIn 1603 the brothers received a monopoly from [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] for the making of wares in the style of [[Faenza]], whether painted polychrome or with white grounds, and a generation later Antoine Conrade, son of Dominique, was made ''faiencier ordinaire'' to the young [[Louis XIV]] in 1644.<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328</ref>  This was repeated in the next generation for another Dominique Conrade, given his ''brevet'' in 1672.<ref>Garnier, 270</ref>\n[[File:Nevers7.JPG|thumb|''faience patriotique'' of the [[French Revolution]]. An aristocrat and bishop: \"Unhappiness re-unites us\", 1791.]]\n\nThe Conrade monopoly was not effective for long, with a second factory starting in 1632, and by 1652 there were four different potteries in Nevers, including one founded by Pierre Custode, whose family became the other main Nevers dynasty of potters.<ref>Garnier, 270; Chaffers, 148</ref>  \n\nThe French faience industry received a huge boost when, late in his reign in 1709, [[Louis XIV]] pressured the wealthy to donate their silver plate, previously what they normally used to dine, to his treasury to help pay for his wars.  They was an \"overnight frenzy\" as the elite rushed to get faience replacements of the best quality.  Nevers garden vases in blue and white were prominently used in the gardens of the [[Chateau de Versailles]].<ref>Moon; McNab, 30</ref>\n\nThe success of the wares led to several other factories opening in the early 18th century, and in 1743 the government limited the number to eleven, to prevent flooding the market.  In 1760 a twelfth was permitted.  By this period Nevers wares had been largely replaced at the top end of the market by other makers, but were producing large quantities of less expensive wares for a broader market.  They did not attempt to compete with the elegant [[Rococo]] style of the French porcelain factories, which was attempted rather successfully by some makers of faience, for example the [[Veuve Perrin]] factory in [[Marseilles]].  All twelve Nevers factories (still including the Conrade and Custode ateliers) were still in operation in 1790, but a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786 led to the French market being flooded by cheaper and better English [[creamware]]s, leading to crisis for all French manufacturers of faience, and by 1797 six had ceased operations, with the other six having reduced their workforce by half.<ref>Chaffers, 148\u2013149, who lists all 12; Badillet, 4; Osborne, 133; Britannica</ref>  \n\nBy this time European [[porcelain]] was becoming cheaper and more reliable, and making life difficult for producers of high-quality earthenware across Europe.<ref>Osborne, 133; Moon</ref>  The Nevers response was to produce topical ''faiences patriotiques'' with which the English were unlikely to compete (although they had done excellent business supplying the new American republic with patriotic wares).<ref>Britannica</ref>\n[[File:Manufacture du bout du monde, Sainte C\u00e9cile.jpg|thumb|Montagon plate with [[Saint Cecilia]], 1888]]\n\nIn 1838 700 workers were reported to be employed,<ref>de Saint-Fargeau, Girault, ''Guide pittoresque du voyageur en France: contenant la statistique ...'', Volume 2, 11, 1838, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yQxAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA7 google books]</ref> but by 1846 only six factories remained, and by 1850 five.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref>  A [[porcelain]] manufactury in Nevers was also mentioned in 1844 by [[Alexandre Brongniart]], but little is known about it.<ref name=\"Litchfield\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsbMKOjvWiAC&pg=PA219 ''Pottery and Porcelain: A Guide to Collectors'' by Frederick Litchfield p.219]</ref>\n\nThe ''manufacture du Bout du monde'' (\"End of the World\" factory) was founded in 1648, and followed the general pattern of the Nevers factories.  By 1875 its fortunes had reached a low ebb, and it was bought by Antoine Montagnon, who had ambitious plans to relaunch it to supply the market for revivalist wares imitating 17th-century pieces, often large and complex pieces.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref><ref name=\"centre\">Dominique Romeyer, [http://www.lejdc.fr/nevers/loisirs/art-litterature/2015/05/19/vingt-cinq-dirigeants-se-sont-succede-a-la-tete-de-la-faiencerie-montagnon-en-367-ans_11445739.html \"Vingt-cinq dirigeants se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de la fa\u00efencerie Montagnon en 367 ans\"], ''Le Journal du Centre'' 19 May 2015</ref>  By 1881 it was the only factory left in Nevers.

The locations of the group are described in note 6 on p. 47 - examples outside France appear to have been ignored completely.</ref>\n\n===Italian style===\nThe Italian immigrants continued at Nevers the ''istoriato'' (narrative) style that was already in decline in Italy, until at least 1660. As was usual in Italy by 1580, designs were mostly adapted from [[old master print|prints]],<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328; McNab, 12</ref> and the outline set out on the pot by a ''ponci'' or [[stencil]], pushing charcoal dust through pin-pricks in a paper drawing or tracing from a print.<ref>McNab, 12</ref>  \n\nThe early pieces did not generally use distinctive marks or inscriptions, though sometimes painting \"Nevers\" on the base of important pieces, perhaps with a date \u2013 the earliest of these is 1589, on a dish in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Coutts, 28</ref>  As with painted [[Limoges enamel]] of the previous century, with which Nevers decoration has some similaritites, a high proportion of religious subjects illustrate [[Old Testament]] subjects.  As with Italian pieces, the subjects, especially those from the Old Testament or [[classical mythology]], tended to be named on the base, sometimes even with the bible chapter noted.<ref>Wilson, 202 for an Italian example; [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194297 Metropolitan Museum page] for the \"Joseph and his brothers\" plate illustrated here.</ref>  \n\nThere is a good deal of uncertainty in the attribution of pieces between the Nevers workshops, and between Nevers pieces and those of other centres.<ref>Chaffers, 149, 151\u2013153 has an illustrated list of marks</ref>  The large dish with ''The Gathering of Manna'' illustrated below, a well-known piece, had been assumed to be Italian, and 16th century, until recently.

Chinese styles would then be taken up by factories in [[Normandy]], especially following the foundation of the [[French East India Company]] in 1664.<ref name=\"Ward\"/><ref>Britannica</ref> \n\nA technique unique to Nevers in French faience, used on some pieces from about 1650 for a few decades, was to stain all the clay from which the body was made either in ''bleu de Nevers'' or (more rarely) a mustard yellow ([[Wedgwood]] did the same for their [[jasperware]] a century later).  This was then painted in white or other colours, using various styles, including bird and flower decoration influenced by Turkish [[Iznik pottery]].<ref>McNab, 18-20, 30 no 12</ref>   \n\nNevers adopted Chinese vase shapes early in the 17th century, earlier than Dutch [[Delftware]].<ref>McNab, 18</ref>  Some Nevers pieces clearly copy [[Chinese export porcelain]] in terms of their painted decoration, both the cheaper [[Kraak ware]] and better quality blue and white wares, whereas others have decoration based on Persian or other Islamic Middle Eastern styles. These often have decoration in white on a rich blue ground (''bleu de Nevers''), as often seen in [[Persian pottery]] of the period, but unusual on Chinese export porcelain, where blue figures on a white ground are the norm in blue and white wares.<ref>McNab, 18\u201320</ref><ref name=\"Ward\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&pg=PA38 ''The Grove encyclopedia of materials and techniques in art'' Gerald W.

In the 17th century Nevers was then a pioneer in imitating Asian ceramic styles in Europe, within some decades followed by all producers of fine wares.  The second half of the 17th century was Nevers' finest period, with several styles being made at the same time, including a grandiose Italianate Court style.<ref>McNab, 20-21; [http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1156287/jardiniere-unknown/ V&A, Nevers] [[Jardiniere]]</ref>   \n\nBy the time of the [[French Revolution]] Nevers wares had ceased to be fashionable and expensive,<ref>Garnier, 274\u2013275</ref> but the relatively crudely painted ''faiences patriotiques'' wares commenting on political events have great interest and charm.<ref>Though not to Garnier, 275, who is very rude about them</ref>  A late 19th-century revival concentrated on high-quality revivalist wares recreating past glories.    \n \n==History==\nThe tradition owes its origin to [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]] (1539\u20131595), a half-French and half Italian politician and courtier who married the heiress of the [[Duke of Nevers|Duchy of Nevers]], which then still gave him great powers in the [[County and Duchy of Nevers]].  He had been born in [[Mantua]], a centre for Italian [[maiolica]], which had already spread to [[Rouen]] and [[Lyons]], and encouraged some Italian potters to move to the city; Giulio Gambin was already in Lyons and the Conrade brothers (Corrado in Italy) came from [[Albisola]], who would found the dynasty that dominated Nevers production for a century.<ref>Coutts, 28; Moon; McNab, 12; Britannica</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=173}}</ref>   \n\nNevers already had a local unglazed pottery industry, and was a very suitable location for making faience. The city was near deposits of excellent pottery clay, an exceptionally good type of sand for making [[ceramic glaze]], forests for wood for the kilns, and was on the major [[Loire]] river.  The earliest dated piece by the Italians is from 1587.<ref>Estienne, 46</ref> \n\nIn 1603 the brothers received a monopoly from [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] for the making of wares in the style of [[Faenza]], whether painted polychrome or with white grounds, and a generation later Antoine Conrade, son of Dominique, was made ''faiencier ordinaire'' to the young [[Louis XIV]] in 1644.<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328</ref>  This was repeated in the next generation for another Dominique Conrade, given his ''brevet'' in 1672.<ref>Garnier, 270</ref>\n[[File:Nevers7.JPG|thumb|''faience patriotique'' of the [[French Revolution]]. An aristocrat and bishop: \"Unhappiness re-unites us\", 1791.]]\n\nThe Conrade monopoly was not effective for long, with a second factory starting in 1632, and by 1652 there were four different potteries in Nevers, including one founded by Pierre Custode, whose family became the other main Nevers dynasty of potters.<ref>Garnier, 270; Chaffers, 148</ref>  \n\nThe French faience industry received a huge boost when, late in his reign in 1709, [[Louis XIV]] pressured the wealthy to donate their silver plate, previously what they normally used to dine, to his treasury to help pay for his wars.  They was an \"overnight frenzy\" as the elite rushed to get faience replacements of the best quality.  Nevers garden vases in blue and white were prominently used in the gardens of the [[Chateau de Versailles]].<ref>Moon; McNab, 30</ref>\n\nThe success of the wares led to several other factories opening in the early 18th century, and in 1743 the government limited the number to eleven, to prevent flooding the market.  In 1760 a twelfth was permitted.  By this period Nevers wares had been largely replaced at the top end of the market by other makers, but were producing large quantities of less expensive wares for a broader market.  They did not attempt to compete with the elegant [[Rococo]] style of the French porcelain factories, which was attempted rather successfully by some makers of faience, for example the [[Veuve Perrin]] factory in [[Marseilles]].  All twelve Nevers factories (still including the Conrade and Custode ateliers) were still in operation in 1790, but a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786 led to the French market being flooded by cheaper and better English [[creamware]]s, leading to crisis for all French manufacturers of faience, and by 1797 six had ceased operations, with the other six having reduced their workforce by half.<ref>Chaffers, 148\u2013149, who lists all 12; Badillet, 4; Osborne, 133; Britannica</ref>  \n\nBy this time European [[porcelain]] was becoming cheaper and more reliable, and making life difficult for producers of high-quality earthenware across Europe.<ref>Osborne, 133; Moon</ref>  The Nevers response was to produce topical ''faiences patriotiques'' with which the English were unlikely to compete (although they had done excellent business supplying the new American republic with patriotic wares).<ref>Britannica</ref>\n[[File:Manufacture du bout du monde, Sainte C\u00e9cile.jpg|thumb|Montagon plate with [[Saint Cecilia]], 1888]]\n\nIn 1838 700 workers were reported to be employed,<ref>de Saint-Fargeau, Girault, ''Guide pittoresque du voyageur en France: contenant la statistique ...'', Volume 2, 11, 1838, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yQxAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA7 google books]</ref> but by 1846 only six factories remained, and by 1850 five.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref>  A [[porcelain]] manufactury in Nevers was also mentioned in 1844 by [[Alexandre Brongniart]], but little is known about it.<ref name=\"Litchfield\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsbMKOjvWiAC&pg=PA219 ''Pottery and Porcelain: A Guide to Collectors'' by Frederick Litchfield p.219]</ref>\n\nThe ''manufacture du Bout du monde'' (\"End of the World\" factory) was founded in 1648, and followed the general pattern of the Nevers factories.  By 1875 its fortunes had reached a low ebb, and it was bought by Antoine Montagnon, who had ambitious plans to relaunch it to supply the market for revivalist wares imitating 17th-century pieces, often large and complex pieces.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref><ref name=\"centre\">Dominique Romeyer, [http://www.lejdc.fr/nevers/loisirs/art-litterature/2015/05/19/vingt-cinq-dirigeants-se-sont-succede-a-la-tete-de-la-faiencerie-montagnon-en-367-ans_11445739.html \"Vingt-cinq dirigeants se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de la fa\u00efencerie Montagnon en 367 ans\"], ''Le Journal du Centre'' 19 May 2015</ref>  By 1881 it was the only factory left in Nevers.

The locations of the group are described in note 6 on p. 47 - examples outside France appear to have been ignored completely.</ref>\n\n===Italian style===\nThe Italian immigrants continued at Nevers the ''istoriato'' (narrative) style that was already in decline in Italy, until at least 1660. As was usual in Italy by 1580, designs were mostly adapted from [[old master print|prints]],<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328; McNab, 12</ref> and the outline set out on the pot by a ''ponci'' or [[stencil]], pushing charcoal dust through pin-pricks in a paper drawing or tracing from a print.<ref>McNab, 12</ref>  \n\nThe early pieces did not generally use distinctive marks or inscriptions, though sometimes painting \"Nevers\" on the base of important pieces, perhaps with a date \u2013 the earliest of these is 1589, on a dish in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Coutts, 28</ref>  As with painted [[Limoges enamel]] of the previous century, with which Nevers decoration has some similaritites, a high proportion of religious subjects illustrate [[Old Testament]] subjects.

This was then painted in white or other colours, using various styles, including bird and flower decoration influenced by Turkish [[Iznik pottery]].<ref>McNab, 18-20, 30 no 12</ref>   \n\nNevers adopted Chinese vase shapes early in the 17th century, earlier than Dutch [[Delftware]].<ref>McNab, 18</ref>  Some Nevers pieces clearly copy [[Chinese export porcelain]] in terms of their painted decoration, both the cheaper [[Kraak ware]] and better quality blue and white wares, whereas others have decoration based on Persian or other Islamic Middle Eastern styles. These often have decoration in white on a rich blue ground (''bleu de Nevers''), as often seen in [[Persian pottery]] of the period, but unusual on Chinese export porcelain, where blue figures on a white ground are the norm in blue and white wares.<ref>McNab, 18\u201320</ref><ref name=\"Ward\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&pg=PA38 ''The Grove encyclopedia of materials and techniques in art'' Gerald W.

He was known for his research into finance and corporate governance and for his contribution to raising the research profile of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT. He was also known for the successful mentoring of a large number of students and colleagues who, as a result, climbed to the top of the academic ladder.\n\nAt the core of his research was the behaviour of security prices, which was subsequently extended to cover corporate governance explanations of firm performance, the stock returns of initial public offerings and trading strategies. Much of the empirical work he did pertained to the emerging markets of Asia, particularly China. In recent times he was involved in two major projects, the first of which was to examine the impact of stock market reforms in China, whereas the second was about developing and testing a new instrument to examine behavioural biases in investor decision-making.\n\nNaughton was a fan of West Ham United football club, and had a strong dislike for Tottenham Hotspur football club, in particular their up-and-coming striker, Harry Kane.\n\n== Early life ==\nNaughton was born in Birmingham (England) on 16 February 1952, then he moved to Ireland at the age of five. He sought independence by leaving home at the age of 16 to undertake a number of jobs, working as a kitchen assistant, a chef, a DJ and a bar tender. He then went through a bit of a hippy phase, rocking the long hair, full beard, leather jacket and flared pants. Before his death he expressed his wish to go to the Glastonbury festival in England at some point in his life. He said that seeing Jimmy Hendrix's final show was one of his most treasured memories. Naughton always had good taste in music.\n\nNaughton was a self-made person. Although he left home with nothing and dropped out of school at 16, he paid for his education by working multiple jobs and managed to become a certified accountant. Following his work as an accountant, he did an MBA at Bradford University and went on to become a lecturer at Leeds Polytechnic. At the age of 30, Naughton went to work at the University of South Pacific in Fiji, where he met his wife, Shahnaz. Soon afterwards came the proposal and they got married in 1986. They went back to Birmingham together before moving to Wollongong, Australia. It was in Wollongong where the couple had their two daughters, Sophie and Jennifer.\n\n== Qualifications and career ==\nNaughton started his academic and professional life as an accountant. In 1975 he obtained membership of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and he was elected as a fellow in 1980. Subsequently, he earned a Master of Business Administration (with a major in Financial Management) from the Management Centre, University of Bradford in 1980. At the PhD level he concentrated on banking and finance as he obtained his doctorate from the Department of Accounting and Finance, University of Birmingham, in 1995.\n\nPrior to taking his last position as the head of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT, he held several academic positions in a number of institutions. From 1997 to 2003 he was a professor of international finance and the head of the School of Accounting and Finance, Griffith University. He was a senior lecturer and the head of the School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, from January 1995 to January 1997. During the period July 1987 to December 1994, he was a senior lecturer in finance at the Department of Management, University of Wollongong. He also held the positions of a lecturer in development finance at the University of Birmingham, a lecturer at the School of Social and Economic Development at the University of the South Pacific (Fiji) and a senior lecturer at the School of Accounting and Applied Economics, Leeds Polytechnic.\n\nNaughton held a number of adjunct/visiting positions. He was an adjunct professor at Universitas 21, Singapore, from 2004 until his death in 2013. He was also a visiting professor at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), Shanghai, a visiting professor at the Centre for Corporate Governance Research, University of Birmingham, an adjunct professor at the Centre for International Business Research, University of Wollongong, an adjunct senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Business, University of Sydney, a visiting fellow at the School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, a visiting research fellow at Universitas Islam, Indonesia, and a visiting senior research fellow at the Department of Accounting and Finance, University of Birmingham.\n\nNaughton's professional experience was exclusively in accounting. During the period 1976-1982 he had his own auditing and accounting practice, Naughton & Co. Prior to that he had obtained auditing and accounting experience with Touche Ross and Morley & Scott Chartered accountants in Birmingham and London, specializing in the audit of banks and financial institutions.\n\n== Scholarly contributions ==\nNaughton made contributions to several areas of finance. Starting with asset pricing, he wrote an article on the Taiwan stock market in which he developed a multifactor asset pricing model incorporating a price limit factor to explain the cross section of asset returns following closely the mimicking portfolio Fama-French methodology.<ref>Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2004) Are Price Limits Priced? Evidence from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, ''Journal of Emerging Market Finance'', 3, 249-267.</ref> The findings showed that the overall market factor, firm size and price limits capture a cross section of average stock returns in a meaningful manner. In an article on China he compared the performance of the traditional CAPM with the multifactor model of Fama and French for equities listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. He also investigated the explanatory power of idiosyncratic volatility and responded to the claim that multifactor model findings can be explained by the turn of the year effect.<ref>Naughton, A., Drew, M. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2005) Pricing of Equities in China: Evidence from the Shanghai Stock Exchange', ''Managerial Finance'', 31, 46-57.</ref> He conducted  further work on Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan to examine the proposition that the beta in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) was lacking in cross-sectional explanatory power.<ref>Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2005) A Multifactor Model Explanation of the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns: Evidence from Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan, ''Finance India'', 19, 135-157.</ref> By incorporating the two most commonly used additional explanatory factors (size and book to market equity) he tested for evidence of multifactor risk premia. The results showed that the overall market factor was highly significant in all of the markets and that the magnitude of significance of the other two factors (size and book to market equity) varied across countries. He rejected the claim that the multifactor model findings could be explained by the turn of the year effect.\n\nNaughton was an expert on trading strategies. In 2008 he published a paper in which he investigated the profitability of momentum investment strategies for the equities listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.<ref>Naughton, A., Truong, C. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2008) Momentum Strategies and Stock Returns: Chinese Evidence, ''Pacific Basin Finance Journal'', 16, 476-492.</ref> He also investigated the role of trading volume to find out if it was related to stock returns. He detected substantial momentum profits during the period 1995 to 2005 and revealed that momentum was a pervasive feature of stock returns. This finding stood as a direct challenge to the validity of the efficient market hypothesis, which has been discredited by the advent of the global financial crisis. In another study of trading strategies he examined the profitability of momentum and contrarian strategies for the equities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange by taking into consideration short-selling restrictions.<ref>Ramiah, V., Mugwagwa, T. and Naughton, A. (2011) Hot and Cold Strategies: Australian Evidence, ''Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies'', 14, 271-295.</ref> He revealed significant contrarian profits and showed that it was a persistent feature of the underlying strategies.\n\nOne area of corporate finance to which he made a contribution was initial public offerings (IPOs). In a study of IPOs in Australia he provided insights into the short and long-term performance of the IPOs for new economy companies in the period 1995 to 2000.<ref>Murgulov, Z. and Naughton, A. (2002) New Economy Initial Public Offerings in Australia, ''Accounting, Accountability and Performance'', 8, 21-60.</ref> He found that new economy IPOs provided high average initial returns to subscribing investors although there was evidence for severe overpricing. Another area of corporate finance to which he contributed was capital structure. In a study of the determinants of the capital structure of Chinese companies he demonstrated, by using the techniques of extreme bounds analysis (EBA), that some of the firm-specific determinants reported as important in previous studies might be fragile, in the sense that the sign and/or significance of the coefficients on these variables changed, depending on model specification (the variables included in or excluded from the model).<ref>Moosa, I., Li, Q. and Naughton, A. (2011) Robust and Fragile Firm-Specific Determinants of the Capital Structure of Chinese Firms, ''Applied Financial Economics'', 21, 1331-1343.</ref> For example, he found that although conventional cross-sectional analysis would lend support to the importance of tangibility and stock price performance, these two variables turned out to be fragile.\n\nAnother area of Naughton's interest, to which he made a contribution, was corporate governance. In one study he focused on the emerging corporate governance reform in China to investigate the relationship between a range of board characteristics and IPO initial returns and long-term performance.<ref>Li, L. and Naughton, A. (2007) Going Public with Good Governance: Evidence from China', ''Corporate Governance'', 15, 1190-1202.</ref> He found evidence indicating that board size is positively related to short-term returns, while a positive long-run relationship existed between performance and the voluntary post-listing separation of the roles of CEO and chair of the board. His results suggested that at least some Chinese listed firms were actively and voluntarily moving towards better governance structures. In another study of corporate governance in China he examined the 2005 policy decision to change the status of non-tradable state and non-state shares into tradable A shares.<ref>Li, Q., Hovey, M. and Naughton, A. (2009) A Review of Corporate Governance in China, in F.J. Lopez Iturriaga (ed.) ''Codes of Good Governance Around the World'', New York: Nova Science Publishers, 415-436.</ref> He envisaged that over time all of these shares would be tradable and potentially transferred to foreign and domestic private sector investors and that those changes had the potential to alter the monitoring and control of the majority of listed firms that until then had been controlled by tightly held blockholders of non-tradable shares. He also studied how parties' formal contracts were underpinned by their ongoing relationship and how welfare changes as the legal system improved.<ref>Hermalin, B, Li, Q. and Naughton, A. (2013) The Relational Underpinnings of Formal Contracting and the Welfare Consequences of Legal System Improvement, ''Economics Letters'', 119, 72-76.</ref>\n\nHis work in international finance was no less impressive. In an award-winning paper he attempted to verify the exchange rate regime that China had been following since 21 July 2005 when a policy shift was implemented, presumably taking China from a dollar peg to a basket peg.<ref>Moosa, I., Naughton, A. and Li, Q. (2009) Exchange Rate Regime Verification: Has China Actually Moved from a Dollar Peg to a Basket Peg?, ''Economia Internazionale'', 62, 41-67.</ref> He demonstrated that while a regime of simple and strict dollar peg had been abandoned, China was on a peg, as it was claimed officially. He suggested that China had shifted to some sort of a discretionary crawling peg against the U.S. dollar. This paper made a significant contribution to the literature on ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' exchange rate regimes and the problem of exchange rate regime verification.\n\nThe diversity of Naughton's research is obvious in a number of other papers. In those papers he investigated the impact of ownership and ownership concentration on the performance of China's listed firms.<ref>Ma, S., Naughton, A. and Tian, G. (2010) Ownership and Ownership Concentration: Which is Important in Determining the Performance of China\u2019s Listed Firms?', ''Accounting and Finance'', 50, 871-897.</ref> He also attempted to find out if idiosyncratic volatility is useful in explaining the variation in expected returns and if the findings can be explained by the turn of the year effect.<ref>Drew, M., Malin, M., Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2006) Idiosyncratic volatility and Security Returns: Evidence from Germany and United Kingdom, ''Studies in Economics and Finance'', 23, 80-93.</ref> In another paper he sought to extend the mounting evidence against the view that the beta coefficient of the capital asset pricing model is the sole measure of risk.<ref>Drew, M., Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2003) Firm Size, Book-to-Market Equity and Security Returns: Evidence from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ''Australian Journal of Management'', 28, 119-139.</ref> He investigated the relationship between firm performance and corporate governance in China, where performance is measured by Tobin's Q.<ref>Hovey, M., Li, L. and Naughton, A. (2003) The Relationship between Valuation and Ownership of Listed Firms in China, ''Corporate Governance'', 11, 112-122.</ref> He also contributed to the literature on trading strategies involving options when he examined the performance of the buy-write option strategy and attempted to find out if such an investment opportunity violated the efficient market hypothesis on the basis of its risk and returns.<ref>Mugwagwa, T., Ramiah, V., Naughton, A. and Moosa, I. (2012) The Efficiency of the Buy-Write Strategy: Evidence from Australia, ''Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money'', 22, 305-328.</ref> Contrarian strategies were considered in another paper in which he investigated the profitability of these strategies for the equities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the relationship between stock returns and past trading volume.<ref>Ramiah, V., Cheng, K., Orriols, J., Naughton, A. and Hallahan, T. (2011) Contrarian Investment Strategies Work Better for Dually-Traded Stocks: Evidence from Hong Kong, ''Pacific-Basin Finance Journal'', 19, 140-156.</ref> Furthermore, he did some work on the link between performance and changes in the size and stability of a firm's officers and directors<ref>Heaney, R., Naughton, A., Fry, T., Davidson, S., McKenzie, M. and Truong, T. (2007) The Link Between Performance and Changes in the Size and Stability of a Firm\u2019s Officers and Directors, ''Journal of Multinational Financial Management'', 17, 16-29.</ref> and surveyed  enterprise reforms in China, making recommendations with respect to the way forward.<ref>Hovey, M. and Naughton, A. (2007) A Survey of Enterprise Reforms in China: The Way Forward, ''Economic Systems'', 31, 138-156.</ref> Most of his contributions had significant practical implications.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Naughton, Tony}}\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:RMIT University faculty]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing]]\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Infobox person\n| honorific_prefix   = \n| name               =  Tony Naughton\n| honorific_suffix   = \n| image              =  \n| birth_date         =  16 February 1952\n| birth_place        = Birmingham (England)\n| death_date         =  13 July 2013\n| death_place        = London (England)\t\n| nationality        = British/Australian\n| employer           = RMIT (2003-2013), Griffith University (1997-2003), University of New South Wales (1995-1997), University of Wollongong (1987-1994), University of Birmingham (1985-1987), University of the South Pacific (1983-1985), Leeds Polytechnic (1976-1982) \n| known_for          = Finance, Financial Analysis, Accounting and Economics \n| notable_works      =  Corporate Governance, Capital Structure, Initial Public Offerings, Behavioural Finance, Asset Pricing, Trading Strategies, Initial Public Offerings, International Finance, Asian Financial markets, \t\tChinese Economics and Finance\n| title              = Professor\n}}\n\n'''Tony Naughton''' (16 February 1952 \u2013 16 July 2013) was a British/Australian financial economist who was the head of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) for over ten years immediately prior to his untimely death in July 2013.

{"title_page": "Jean Ferr\u00e9", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n'''Jean Ferr\u00e9''' (29 May 1929, Saint-Pierre-les-\u00c9glises, now part of [[Chauvigny]], Vienne, \u2013 10 October 2006, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]) was a French [[art historian]] and a right-political journalist. He was also the founder of the Paris-based ''[[Radio Courtoisie]]'' in 1987.\n\n==Early years==\nFrom 1942 Ferr\u00e9 performed his secondary studies at the ''Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas'' in [[Poitiers]], a [[Jesuit]] school. After his baccalaureate, he undertook ''math\u00e9lem'', then studied in the ''\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale de m\u00e9canique et d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9''. He did not finish his studies. Towards the end of 1945, he constructed a [[shortwave]] [[transceiver]] with double frequency change and lamps. This taste for radio was to last his whole life.\n\nIn 1949, Ferr\u00e9 became an amateur radio licensee with callsign F9OV. He frequently contacted K2UN, an American enthusiast better known as [[Barry Goldwater]], who would later run unsuccessfully for President of the United States of America. K2UN was broadcasting from the roof of the UN building with highly effective equipment; he was always surprised to achieve contact with Ferr\u00e9, who only had a 10-watt transmitter. When K2UN came to France, Ferr\u00e9 asked to meet him \u2013 the former remembered their contact. for Barry Goldwater, Ferr\u00e9 was \"Mister 10 watts\".\n\n=== First steps in journalism===\nIn 1952, Jean Ferr\u00e9 crossed the [[R\u00edo de Oro]] with a friend, and paid a visit to the forbidden city of [[Smara]]. He would report this adventure in ''Au d\u00e9sert interdit'' (to the forbidden desert). In the same year, Ferr\u00e9 developed a great friendship with Bernard Grasset; for two years, they had dinner together almost every night. It was Grasset who engendered Ferr\u00e9's appreciation of [[Henry de Montherlant]]'s work.\n\nIn early 1956, Ferr\u00e9 participated in the weekly magazine ''Notre \u00c9poque'', created at the behest of Catholic investors with the intention of it being a right-wing counterweight to ''[[La Vie|La Vie Catholique illustr\u00e9e]]''. It ceased to appear, however, after five months. In June of the same year, he created the monthly news magazine ''C'est-\u00e0-dire''. The editorial line was staunchly right-wing; the format was based on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Participants in the creation of ''C'est-\u00e0-dire'' were the historian Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chiappe, Jean-Luc de Carbuccia, and another man of the theatre, Jacques H\u00e9bertot. ''C'est-\u00e0-dire'' also benefited from the support and friendship of [[Louis Pauwels]] and the participation of Nicole de Buron.\n\n=== Ferr\u00e9 and Algeria \u2013 the Spanish exile ===\nJean Ferr\u00e9 was a supporter of ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]''. On this point he was in disagreement with de Gaulle. He had demanded that his team avoid polemics; however, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chiappe wrote an article aggressively calling de Gaulle into question, describing him as a \"paranoiac\" with \"intermittent delirium\". The magazine was seized. Ferr\u00e9 continued for some time to publish it in the form of a confidential letter, which was itself seized in turn. In late 1960, Ferr\u00e9 paid a visit to [[Raoul Salan|General Salan]] who had fled to Spain. From this time onward, they would be collaborators. On 19 or 20 April 1961, it was Ferr\u00e9 who informed Salan of the plan for the [[Algiers putsch of 1961]].<ref>''Radio Courtoisie'', Catherine Gourin's programme of 3 October 1991</ref> This relationship made Ferr\u00e9 a wanted man, and he went underground.\n\nIn late September 1961, wanted for his participation in the putsch, for his support of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' and for offending the head of state, de Gaulle, Ferr\u00e9 was stopped and brought to [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison]], where he began a [[hunger strike]]. He was then given the status of ''intern\u00e9 administratif'' (administrative detainee) according to the formula of [[Roger Frey]], the interior minister of the time, which applied to a suspect who had not yet been brought to trial. Under this provision, Ferr\u00e9 was imprisoned in the Saint-Maurice-l'Ardoise military camp in [[Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres]] in the [[Gard|Gard department]].\n\nIn 1962, he was freed, but faced a new threat from French justice. However, Judge Schweig rescued him from immediate arrest and from the penalty of 10 years imprisonment which had already been set out for him; thanks to which he avoided a trial and went into exile in Spain, where he associated with prominent [[Francisco Franco|Franquist]]s, notably including the ''caudillo'''s own sister. He also built a friendship with the first president of the senate of democratic Spain, [[Antonio Font\u00e1n]]. He was productive in [[Madrid]], particular in his work on [[Antoine Watteau]], a four-volume study which would be published in 1972.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cailleux|first=Jean|author-link=Jean Cailleux|date=April 1975|title=A Strange Monument and Other Watteau Studies|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]]|volume=117|issue=865|pages=246\u2013249|jstor=877986}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Figaro Magazine''  ===\nOn returning to France, Ferr\u00e9 got back with his old friends from ''C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire''. He resumed his journalistic activities, notably as a radio and television columnist at ''[[Le Figaro]]'', and subsequently ''Figaro Magazine'', of which he was a founder with Pauwels.\n\n==Radio Solidarit\u00e9 and Radio Courtoisie ==\n{{main|Radio Courtoisie}}\nIn September 1981, Bernadette d'Angevilliers and [[Philippe Malaud]], former minister under [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]], created ''[[Radio Solidarit\u00e9]]'', with the support of Yannick Urrien. This free radio station had associations with ''[[Rassemblement pour la R\u00e9publique]]'' and with the ''[[Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise]]'' and was strongly opposed to the political left of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]. Thanks to his radio columns, which were favourable to ''Radio Solidarit\u00e9'', Ferr\u00e9 was noticed by d'Angevilliers, who proposed that he collaborate with them.\n\nIn May and June 1982, Ferr\u00e9 created the broadcast formula of the ''Libre Journal'': an hour and a half programme each evening based around a guest belonging to the political right. Ferr\u00e9 proposed that the radio should be open to \"all people of the right\"; pursuant to this, [[Serge de Beketch]] was invited to direct a regular Wednesday evening broadcast. However, following the 1984 European elections, de Beketch exposed the radio station to the accusation of having helped the political breakthrough of the ''Front National''. De Beketch was ordered to leave; Ferr\u00e9 sought to defend de Beketch and was also dismissed.\n\nAt that point Ferr\u00e9 created the \"''Radio Solidarit\u00e9'' listeners' defense committee\" (CDARS). It was under this name, declared to the Paris police prefecture on 12 December 1985, that he founded ''Radio Courtoisie'' (''courtoisie'' means [[courtesy]]). ''Radio Courtoisie'' made its first broadcast on 7 November 1987.\n\nFrom this day until the end of his life, led ''Radio Courtoisie'' devoting all his time to it. Every Monday evening he hosted in person a ''Libre Journal'' without interruption until 31 July 1996, the date of his last broadcast.\n\nHe died on 10 October 2006 following [[renal cancer]].\n\n== Positions ==\nFerr\u00e9 always asserted his opposition to what he called ''[[pens\u00e9e unique]]'' and to the ideology of [[political correctness]]. Being himself aligned with [[Charles Maurras]], Ferr\u00e9 was sympathetic to [[royal family|royalty]] and advocated traditionalist Catholicism. He continually expressed his desire to defend French language and civilisation. Firmly on the right, he presented himself as [[anti-communist]]. In this context, ''Radio Courtoisie'' could have been conceived by him as a means of advancing his ideas. As he himself asserted on air,<ref>For example, in his broadcast of 16 April 2001</ref> he hoped to \"rally all patriots\" and reconcile all Frenchmen.\n\nFerr\u00e9 willingly defined himself as a [[Humanism|humanist]]. Thus he condemned vigorously the murderous violence of all [[totalitarianism]], that of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and of [[Nazism]]<ref>For example, in his broadcast of 30 December 2002</ref> but also that of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and communism. Defending a Christian conception of the right to life, he was as opposed to the death penalty as he was to voluntary termination of pregnancy. On many occasions he invited on air Professor [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune]] and representatives of his group ''[[Fondation J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune]]''.\n\n== Alain Decaux on Ferr\u00e9 ==\n{{quote|You are of the right, I am of the left.
