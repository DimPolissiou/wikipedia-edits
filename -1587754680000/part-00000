There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released.

The opening ceremonies, held in Kezar Stadium, began with former U.S. Olympians, George Frenn and Susan McGrievey lighting a flame that had been carried on a torch run across America, beginning in New York at the Stonewall Inn.<ref>{{Cite book|last=edited by Rita Liberti and Maureen M.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071856/http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate. The Chicago Gay Games VII ended with no debt and all bills paid. In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with $5.3 million (Canadian) of debt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames were held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games were held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n=== Media impact of AIDS on the Gay Games ===\nBefore and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]) and how it was affecting the gay community.<ref name=\":1\" /> With the number of [[LGBT]] members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Sports}}\n* [[EuroGames|EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)]]\n* [[International Gay and Lesbian Football Association]]\n* [[List of LGBT sportspeople]]\n* [[Principle 6 campaign]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130929011426/http://www.gg9cle.com/ Gay Games Cleveland/Akron 2014]\n* [http://www.gaygames.org/ Federation of Gay Games]\n* [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5868750,00.html Postcard from Europe: Questioning the necessity of the Gay Games]\n* [http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00450.xml Minnesota lesbian/gay committee of the International Athletic Association archives]\n*  [http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive/gay-games-iii/ Documentation of Celebration '90 Gay Games III held in Vancouver on VIVO Media Arts Centre's website]\n* [http://gaytodo.com/ Gay Ireland]\n\n{{Gay Games}}\n{{International multi-sport events}}\n\n[[Category:Gay Games]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1982]]\n[[Category:LGBT sports]]\n", "name_user": "Redsports715", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed citing errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Games"}

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev  |last2=Lemanskii |first1=Aleksander A. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 |language=Russian |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Munro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue= |pages=484\u2013496 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1913.0010 }}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />\n\n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]].

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916\u2013920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical Journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234\u2013238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/1979_2_234-238.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]].

As to be known, it is [[Inversion in a sphere|inversion in sphere]].  Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball of radius <math> a </math>. Adjunct space has the same Schwarzschild metrics.

Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton |first=J. A. |last2=Chu |first2=L.

Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1021/acsanm.9b01950|title = Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces|year = 2019|last1 = Ghai|first1 = Viney|last2 = Singh|first2 = Harpreet|last3 = Agnihotri|first3 = Prabhat K.|journal = ACS Applied Nano Materials|volume = 2|issue = 12|pages = 7951\u20137956}}</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the diameter of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]].

A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length.

To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev  |last2=Lemanskii |first1=Aleksander A. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 |language=Russian |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].

The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only.

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only.

An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]].

The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes.

According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.

The film was written and directed by acclaimed Norwegian [[subculture]] [[comic book]] artist [[Christopher Nielsen]] and features a number of characters from Nielsen's dark humor-laden comic books. The plot is an [[adult]]-oriented [[black comedy]] in which different groups of varying nationalities, and motives, all attempt to find a wayward and drug-addicted elephant in the Norwegian [[tundra|wilderness]] before the others do. The film explores a wide number of themes including addiction, [[drug abuse]], [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[nature]], [[tragedy]], crime, [[materialism]], [[urban decay]], [[animal cruelty]] and [[animal rights]].\n\nIt was Norway's first computer animated film. Costing in excess of 120 million [[Norwegian krone]]r it is the second most expensive Norwegian film to date, behind ''[[Max Manus (film)|Max Manus]]''. Several British CGI studios were involved in the production of the film, although the film was mostly a Norwegian production. The voice actors for the original Norwegian version included [[Kristopher Schau]], Jan S\u00e6lid, Are&Odin, Egil Birkeland, Terje Ragner, Anders T. Andersen and Mikkel Gaup.\n\nBritish comedy writer and actor [[Simon Pegg]] wrote a screenplay for the wider [[English-speaking world]] which was subsequently released [[Direct-to-video|straight to DVD]] on 7 October 2008<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/releaseinfo Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Release dates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by BreakThru Films. The voice actors of the 2008 English-language version is made up of an international [[ensemble cast]] that includes Pegg himself, [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Phil Daniels]], [[Jay Simpson (actor)|Jay Simpson]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[James Cosmo]], [[David Tennant]], [[Steve Pemberton]], [[Reece Shearsmith]], [[Mark Gatiss]], [[Megan Dodds]], [[Douglas Henshall]], [[Kris Marshall]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Samantha Morton]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]] and [[Lisa Maxwell (actress)|Lisa Maxwell]].\n\nThe film is dedicated to [[Joachim Nielsen]] (1964\u20132000),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/crazycredits Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Crazy credits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the director's brother and a rock musician famous in his native Norway, who had died of a drug overdose after quitting them successfully for many years. Whilst well received in its native country, reception to ''Free Jimmy'' has been mixed in the English-speaking world.\n\n==Plot==\n''The events of the original movie take place entirely in Norway; in the English-language version of the movie, the story begins in Britain, and ends up in Norway with the travelling circus.''\n\nAt night, an [[animal testing]] laboratory in grimy downtown [[Oslo]] is broken into by the \"urban guerrillas\", a group of bumbling, [[vegan]] [[animal rights activists]]. They first release some rabbits, which refuse to leave. They then set the rats free, then cats, which to the horror of the activists, eat the rats. They then release a small yapping dog which in turn, again to their horror, kills the cats. They bury the dead animals, vowing to at some point take revenge on \"animal oppressing\" society. One of them, Sonia, a highly-strung, anxiety-stricken woman, keeps the dog and names the dog \"[[Karma]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, three inept [[stoner (drug user)|stoners]] and bungling [[habitual criminal]]s named Odd, Gaz and Flea (Odd, Geir and K\u00e6lle in the Norwegian version) sit around in a decrepit apartment, watching the news story about the lab break-in. Their shady American friend Roy Arnie (a fellow Norwegian childhood friend in the original) arrives and offers them a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity with Circus Stromowski, a travelling Russian [[circus]] led by Ringmaster Igor Stromowski. The lads agree as they are in debt with Roy Arnie, and it is apparently a good money-raiser, and to escape a local gangster named Ivan. However, upon arriving at the circus, they find Stromowski to be utterly deranged, the acts dangerous, and performers suicidal. The entire circus is full of useless, miserable has-beens and tired animals that will only perform under the influence of [[narcotics]]. What's more, the four lads are actually to be [[animal handler]]s with the dangerous animals in the circus stable. The star attraction is \"Jimmy\", a captive large male elephant who is paranoid of police and with an earring and half a tusk sawn off. Roy Arnie gives Jimmy [[speed (drug)|speed]] to incite the animal to go crazy and perform in the ring for the spectators. At night, he gives Jimmy heroin to sedate him. Soon the elephant becomes [[Drug addiction|addicted]].\n\nRoy admits to the others that he has stolen over a million pounds worth of heroin from a tanker owned by the [[Russian Mafia]], and that he joined the circus to escape them. The four lads hatch a plan to smuggle the heroin out of Norway by putting it inside the elephant. Roy makes an incision in Jimmy's buttocks, places the bags of drugs inside, and then sews it back up. He has a plan to set up his own circus with the money he makes from the heroin, the \"Roy Arnie Circus\", and believes Jimmy to be the key to his dream. However, on the night the lads plan to steal the elephant, Jimmy escapes when he is accidentally given speed instead of heroin, and bolts out of a door left open by the animal rights activists. Jimmy's drug-induced escape causes widespread chaos. Flea comically steals a van with no windshield in the ensuing chase of Jimmy, which leads them up into the frozen [[moorland]].\n\nThree [[Motorcycle|bikers]] dressed in [[S\u00e1mi people#Clothing|traditional S\u00e1mi garb]] have been tailing the lads the whole time. These bikers turn out to be members of the highly feared \"[[S\u00e1mi people|Laplander]] [[motorcycle gang]]\", who have been hired by the Russians and are looking for the heroin, and revenge on Roy Arnie. After overhearing their conversations they learn of where the drugs are, and decide to first go after the elephant. Meanwhile, the animal rights activists are hot on Jimmy's trail with the intention of rescuing Jimmy. Jimmy is also hunted by a group of trigger-happy, [[redneck]]-type [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[big game hunter]]s ([[Tr\u00f8ndelag|'''tr\u00f8ndere''']] in the Norwegian version) want to shoot something bigger than a moose or a deer for a change. So begins a mad-cap cross-country [[road trip]] to find Jimmy, with each group having different motives. The four stoners crash a [[log cabin]] which is occupied by an elderly American couple, but the three Lappish Mafia bikers find them there, kill the couple, and torture the four stoners for information on the whereabouts of Jimmy the elephant.\n\nJimmy nearly dies on the moors as he begins to go through [[cold turkey|withdrawal]], although a seemingly intelligent and benevolent [[moose]] with golden antlers befriends the elephant and attempts to nurse him back to health by nudging him towards water and bringing him grass to eat. The moose pushes Jimmy into a rocky overhang, protecting the elephant from the elements. The moose forces Jimmy to stand on occasion by pushing him up and holding him up with his antlers, bringing back the strength in Jimmy's legs. Over the course of a few painful days, with the moose's help, Jimmy makes a full recovery from the drugs, and again becomes one with nature away from the ugly trappings of man.\n\nWhen the groups converge on Jimmy's location, chaos ensues which results in most of the people involved getting killed in various ways, mostly violent and bloody. As the elephant and the moose escape into the sunset, the elephant accidentally steps on Sonia the activist's dog, Karma, splatting it. Sonia momentarily loses her temper and picks up one of the hunters' rifles and shoots Jimmy in the behind, unwittingly bursting the bags of heroin inside and causing Jimmy to die quickly of massive drug overdose. This causes Sonia to recoil in horror in what she has done, and she flees amidst nervous breakdown in the knowledge she has harmed an animal. The moose causes a landslide which buries Jimmy's body, and after the moose sits poignantly by the mound of rocks which now entomb the elephant, the moose gallops off into the sunset alone.\n\nThe only other survivors of the massacre, the four stoners, do not witness these events, and back at their apartment assault Roy for leading them to the situation in the first place, because of his mad circus dreams, and \"for Jimmy\", \"our mate.\" Finally, Roy, full of remorse over his actions in the past, wanders out onto the moors alone to look for the elephant, unaware that Jimmy is already dead and entombed under rocks and out of sight. Roy disappears into a terrible [[blizzard]] calling out \"Jimmy\" in vain.\n\n==English-language version==\n\n===Overview===\nThe plot of the English-language version of the film remains virtually unchanged to the original in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. The [[audio track]] is [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed over]] with English voices, with contemporary British dialogue written by [[Simon Pegg]], and Pegg receives credit in the screenplay. It was released on DVD on 7 October 2008, by BreakThru Films, with Bill Godfrey as Executive Producer.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/fullcredits#cast Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nUnlike the original which was released in cinemas in Norway, ''Free Jimmy'' was a [[direct-to-video]] release in the English speaking world.\n\nAlthough only the audio has been changed in the English-language version, the new dialogue makes for some changes to the original Norwegian film. For example, Roy, Odd, Flea and Baz are [[cockney]]s from London instead of east enders from [[Oslo]] in Norway (that curiously enough has a similar working class type of [[sociolect]] as cockneys from east London.). The rest of the film does however still take place in Norway, as the Londoners end up there anyway as they travel with the touring Russian circus. Other significant plot changes are obvious, such as other characters are made British instead of Norwegian, and the [[redneck]]-type hunting party are apparently [[Scottish people|Scottish]] in the English-language version.\n\n===Cast===\nThe voice actors of the English-language version make up an international [[ensemble cast]] that include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Several Norwegian companies were involved in the production and distribution,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/companycredits Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Company credits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> although a significant part of the film was produced in London at Slave Studios, the CGI company owned by animation producer [[Andy Frain]]. However, the main company involved in the production was Storm Studio, a Norwegian company.\n\nBy January 2004 it was apparent that the total budget would be three times as originally planned, and the premiere was pushed back a year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/trivia Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It became the most expensive film ever made in Norway at the time, until the film ''[[Max Manus (film)|Max Manus]]'' was produced two years later on a bigger budget.\n\nThe lighting and rendering of the movie has been finalised in a Canadian company located in Montreal (Modelink). The entire job took nearly two years to finish and spanned 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe film is dedicated to [[Joachim Nielsen]] (1964\u20132000),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/crazycredits Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Crazy credits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the director's brother and a rock musician famous in his native Norway, who had died of a drug overdose after many years of being clean. The director intended the film as an allegory of his brother's life, with the elephant representing his brother, the golden-antlered moose symbolising hope, determination, compassion and inner strength, and the other characters in the story representing outside factors such as prejudice, selfishness, addiction, dependence, manipulation, coercion, peer pressure, weakness and temptation.\n\n==Box office==\nIn its Norway the film was released in cinemas in 2006, where it was a box office hit making over 200 million [[Norwegian krone]]r in profit. However, when the English-language version was released to the wider world in 2008, it was a [[direct-to-video]] release.\n\n==Awards==\n* In its native Norway, the film won an [[Amanda (award)|Amanda]] in the category \"Best Film\" in 2006.\n* Awarded \"Le Cristal du long m\u00e9trage\" at the French [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] 2007.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/awards Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe original version of the film was critically well received in its native Norway, and remains something of a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|hit]] in the country, although this may be tied to the director's cult status in Norway, where he is renowned for his work in comic books. The film successfully portrayed modern Norwegian ironic humor. The film was noted for its animation, and won numerous international awards for it.\n\nHowever, the later English-language version has received mixed reviews, mostly negative. These include a scathing review by Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'' who described it as \"joyless\" and those who watch it to be \"dumb animals themselves\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/free-jimmy The film]</ref> Many Norwegian fans noted that depth of story was missing in the new version, and that the overall message of the film and the original ironic humor had been lost in translation and the target audience had become unclear. ''Free Jimmy'' currently has a \"rotten\" rating of only 10% on aggregate ratings site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/free_jimmy/ Free Jimmy \u2013 Trailers \u2013 Movie Reviews \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007152509/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/free_jimmy/ |date=7 October 2008 }}</ref> ''Free Jimmy'' currently has 6.1 out of 10 in user ratings on the [[Internet Movie Database]]<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/ratings</ref> and a three star rating out of five on MSN Movies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/free-jimmy/ |title=Free Jimmy (2006) \u2013 Overview \u2013 MSN Movies<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=19 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911214629/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/free-jimmy/ |archive-date=11 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNot all English-language reviews were negative.

The moose causes a landslide which buries Jimmy's body, and after the moose sits poignantly by the mound of rocks which now entomb the elephant, the moose gallops off into the sunset alone.\n\nThe only other survivors of the massacre, the four stoners, do not witness these events, and back at their apartment assault Roy for leading them to the situation in the first place, because of his mad circus dreams, and \"for Jimmy\", \"our mate.\" Finally, Roy, full of remorse over his actions in the past, wanders out onto the moors alone to look for the elephant, unaware that Jimmy is already dead and entombed under rocks and out of sight. Roy disappears into a terrible [[blizzard]] calling out \"Jimmy\" in vain.\n\n==English-language version==\n\n===Overview===\nThe plot of the English-language version of the film remains virtually unchanged to the original in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. The [[audio track]] is [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed over]] with English voices, with contemporary British dialogue written by [[Simon Pegg]], and Pegg receives credit in the screenplay. It was released on DVD on 7 October 2008, by BreakThru Films, with Bill Godfrey as Executive Producer.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/fullcredits#cast Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nUnlike the original which was released in cinemas in Norway, ''Free Jimmy'' was a [[direct-to-video]] release in the English speaking world.\n\nAlthough only the audio has been changed in the English-language version, the new dialogue makes for some changes to the original Norwegian film. For example, Roy, Odd, Flea and Baz are [[cockney]]s from London instead of east enders from [[Oslo]] in Norway (that curiously enough has a similar working class type of [[sociolect]] as cockneys from east London.). The rest of the film does however still take place in Norway, as the Londoners end up there anyway as they travel with the touring Russian circus. Other significant plot changes are obvious, such as other characters are made British instead of Norwegian, and the [[redneck]]-type hunting party are apparently [[Scottish people|Scottish]] in the English-language version.\n\n===Cast===\nThe voice actors of the English-language version make up an international [[ensemble cast]] that include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Several Norwegian companies were involved in the production and distribution,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/companycredits Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Company credits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> although a significant part of the film was produced in London at Slave Studios, the CGI company owned by animation producer [[Andy Frain]]. However, the main company involved in the production was Storm Studio, a Norwegian company.\n\nBy January 2004 it was apparent that the total budget would be three times as originally planned, and the premiere was pushed back a year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/trivia Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It became the most expensive film ever made in Norway at the time, until the film ''[[Max Manus (film)|Max Manus]]'' was produced two years later on a bigger budget.\n\nThe lighting and rendering of the movie has been finalised in a Canadian company located in Montreal (Modelink). The entire job took nearly two years to finish and spanned 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe film is dedicated to [[Joachim Nielsen]] (1964\u20132000),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/crazycredits Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Crazy credits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the director's brother and a rock musician famous in his native Norway, who had died of a drug overdose after many years of being clean. The director intended the film as an allegory of his brother's life, with the elephant representing his brother, the golden-antlered moose symbolising hope, determination, compassion and inner strength, and the other characters in the story representing outside factors such as prejudice, selfishness, addiction, dependence, manipulation, coercion, peer pressure, weakness and temptation.\n\n==Box office==\nIn its Norway the film was released in cinemas in 2006, where it was a box office hit making over 200 million [[Norwegian krone]]r in profit. However, when the English-language version was released to the wider world in 2008, it was a [[direct-to-video]] release.\n\n==Awards==\n* In its native Norway, the film won an [[Amanda (award)|Amanda]] in the category \"Best Film\" in 2006.\n* Awarded \"Le Cristal du long m\u00e9trage\" at the French [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] 2007.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/awards Slipp Jimmy fri (2006) \u2013 Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe original version of the film was critically well received in its native Norway, and remains something of a [[cult hit]] in the country, although this may be tied to the director's cult status in Norway, where he is renowned for his work in comic books. The film successfully portrayed modern Norwegian ironic humor. The film was noted for its animation, and won numerous international awards for it.\n\nHowever, the later English-language version has received mixed reviews, mostly negative. These include a scathing review by Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'' who described it as \"joyless\" and those who watch it to be \"dumb animals themselves\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/free-jimmy The film]</ref> Many Norwegian fans noted that depth of story was missing in the new version, and that the overall message of the film and the original ironic humor had been lost in translation and the target audience had become unclear. ''Free Jimmy'' currently has a \"rotten\" rating of only 10% on aggregate ratings site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/free_jimmy/ Free Jimmy \u2013 Trailers \u2013 Movie Reviews \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007152509/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/free_jimmy/ |date=7 October 2008 }}</ref> ''Free Jimmy'' currently has 6.1 out of 10 in user ratings on the [[Internet Movie Database]]<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/ratings</ref> and a three star rating out of five on MSN Movies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/free-jimmy/ |title=Free Jimmy (2006) \u2013 Overview \u2013 MSN Movies<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=19 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911214629/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/free-jimmy/ |archive-date=11 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNot all English-language reviews were negative.

{"title_page": "Hanneli Goslar", "text_new": "Hanneli Pick-Goslar\nAnne Frank's childhood friend and Holocaust survivor Hanneli Pick-Goslar Hanneli Pick-Goslarvisited the Scholastic Web site in May 1997 and May 1999. During this project, students had the opportunity to ask Hanneli questions about everything from her close friendship with Anne to how she survived living in a concentration camp. She really loved doing it in bed. Her husband stated that she was really good at ittt. He loved eating her out She loved sucking the  too. Uhhhh eattt meeee\n\nBelow are Hanneli's answers to questions from students.\nClick the following categories to see specific questions and answers from the interview:\nGrowing Up with Anne | The Impact of War | Surviving a Concentration Camp | Helping Anne | Life After the War | The Diary & Remembering Anne\n\nGrowing Up with Anne\n\nWhat did you think of Anne when you first met her? How long were you friends with Anne?\nI was a little girl, so I don't remember. I think I liked her. We had met once before kindergarten, and then when we saw each other in class we ran to each other's arms. Both of our families had moved from Germany to escape Hitler, and we lived next door to each other.\n\nAnna and I met for the first time in 1934 when both our families came from Germany to Holland. We met in a grocery store. My mother and Anne's mother started to speak German because both ladies didn't know how to speak Dutch. Mrs. Frank came with her younger daughter and it came out that she's half a year younger than I am. When my mother brought me to kindergarten the next day, I didn't know the language or anybody and I saw only Anna's back. She was making music with bells. Anna turned around and ran into my arms and I ran into hers, and from then on we were friends.\n\nWhat kinds of games did you and Anne play?\nWe played hopscotch, marbles, and jump rope... all the same things you play now.\n\nDid Anne tell you her secrets like she told Kitty (her diary)?\nAnna would sit in class between lessons and she would shield her diary and write and write. Everybody would ask her \"what are you writing?\" And, the answer always was \"it's none of your business.\"\n\nCould you tell us what your memories are of Anne Frank? What was her personality like?\nAnne was a very spicy little girl. She was just \"normal\" \u2014 like everyone else. Margot, her older sister, was the really special one. Margot was very good-looking, a very good student, and also very obedient. Anna and I were exactly the other way around. My mother would describe Anna \u2014 she would say, \"G-d knows everything, but Anna knows everything better.\"\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nWas Anne as outgoing and humorous as she portrays herself in her diary?\nOne story is that Anna would like to sit in front of everyone. She'd take her shoulder out of its socket (don't try this at home!) and then you'd hear \"k-nock k-nock\" and everyone would say \"wow,\" and Anna would be very happy because she'd have drawn attention to herself.\n\nWhen you went to Anne's house and they told you she had left, did you think you would ever see her again?\nYes. It was only the beginning then. We didn't think it would be so bad. We were only children. We didn't think of such things. We had never heard the name \"concentration camp\" or the name \"Auschwitz.\" Auschwitz was just a village in Poland \u2014 it didn't mean anything. You heard about people going to a work camp in the east. And, so it didn't sound like anything. We thought they were going to work. But, we should have known because if they take people out of hospitals, it must've meant something. But we didn't know and we wouldn't have believed it if they had told us what was going to happen.\n\nWas it hard for you when Anne left you without telling you? How did you feel?\nWhen I heard from Anna's tenant that they left for Switzerland, I was happy for her because I hoped they would make it. But, I knew it was hard for Jewish people to get to Switzerland. In order to get in, you had to pass through two borders \u2014 one in Belgium and one in France. Both countries had been invaded by Germany. When you finally reached the Swiss border, only non-Jewish refugees were allowed in, so we were very concerned that the Franks wouldn't make it.\n\nWould you rather have had Anne with you in the same camp or in another one so you wouldn't have seen her suffer?\nI was glad to see her, but I had hoped she was safe in Switzerland, so it was very sad.\n\n\n^ Top of Page\nThe Impact of War\n\nHow long was the war going on before you were deported to a concentration camp?\nThe war started in Holland on May 10, 1940. I was taken June 20, 1943.\n\nWhen did the war really start for you? When did you begin to see the hatred clearly?\nThe war, for me, started when the Germans set up laws against the Jewish people. This started around the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942. We were forced to wear yellow stars; we had to carry identification cards with a \"J\" for Jew; we weren't allowed on public transportation; we had to give in our bicycles (bicycles are the major form of transportation in Amsterdam); we weren't allowed to shop in any store \u2014 only in Jewish-owned ones and only between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. At 8 p.m. we had to be home until 6 in the morning. We weren't allowed any nice things like going to the swimming pool and tennis courts. Even sitting on park benches was forbidden. The benches in the park were written \"Not for Jewish people,\" or \"Forbidden for Jewish people and dogs.\" They opened schools for Jewish children. Christians were not allowed to go to Jewish doctors, lawyers, etc. My father had to register the amount of money he had. I remember my mother gave our radio away because the BBC (British radio) was forbidden.\n\nDid you ever have to go into hiding, and if you did, who helped you?\nNo, I did not go into hiding. We couldn't because my mother was pregnant and it wasn't fair to Christian friends who would hide you. After my mother died, my father wanted my sister and I to hide, but I didn't want to. Our names were on his identification card, and if the Germans found him without us and saw our names on his card, he'd get a worse punishment then if we were with him.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nAlso, to go into hiding you needed a lot of money for food. The people hiding you could not afford to feed you. You had to give them money for food. You couldn't use food-ration cards because you're non-existent when you're hiding.\n\nHow old were you when you got caught by the Nazis?\nI was caught by the Nazis in June 1943, so I was fourteen years old.\n\nWhat do you think was the scariest part of the Holocaust?\nThe gas chambers were very scary, but I didn't know that they existed when I was at the camps.\n\nHow did you and your family deal with all of the hardships you were going through and still be able to live through it all?\nThat's a hard question! Maybe because I was young, and when you're younger you see things as more hopeful for the future!\n\n^ Top of Page\nSurviving a Concentration Camp\n\nHow did you get sent to the camp?\nOn June 20,1943, the SS came and closed the whole area, almost no Jews were left in Holland. They came with trucks and Dutch police. They went door to door, looking for Jewish people in hiding. If you were Jewish, you had 20 minutes to come down with your backpack.\n\nWe had a Christian neighbor who loved my little sister, and when we were taken she went to the SS and asked if she could keep the little girl. The SS officer said, Aren't you ashamed to want to help the Jews? She said no and then fainted. She sent us little packages, and put a book in it about the nurse Florence Nightingale. I often wonder if that's why I decided to become a nurse.\n\nWhat were your living quarters in Bergen-Belsen like?\nAt the end, when people came from death marches to Bergen-Belsen, the beds were changed from two stories to three stories high, and we had to sleep two in a bed, instead of just one. There were no benches to eat on. There was only cold water to wash clothes and hair. So the warm, brown water that was supposed to be coffee, we used to wash our hair because it was the only warm water we could get.\n\nWhat did you take with you to the camps?\nI was a little girl and didn't know what to take. Thank God, I took winter clothes. It's very cold in Germany and I was prepared. I left my mother's jewelry at home. That was so silly. I could've taken it and I would have it today. Or, I could've exchanged it for food.\n\nWere you required to work in the concentration camp?\nOnly for five days and not very hard. I had to make braids for cellophane bags. It was not very hard work. I was free to take care of my little sister.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nWhat kept you alive in the concentration camp?\nI had to stay alive because I had to take care of my little sister. My father had been able to get passports and papers to be exchanged against German prisoners of war. Our exchange was to be to Palestine. But in the end we weren't exchanged. Because of the passports and papers, we were in a better position than all the other Jewish people who were sent to concentration camps.\n\nWhen was it most difficult to keep going and stay positive during your time in the labor or concentration camps?\nThe most difficult time was when my father died. I didn't know when the horror would end. It was the worst time in the camp. I had already been in for two months. I had no mother and no father and the camp was so bad. Every day more and more people died.\n\nThere was a big disappointment because we thought we were going to be exchanged the next day. We were at Bergen-Belsen, a transfer camp, because we had Palestine exchange papers, which meant that maybe we would be allowed to go to Palestine. The conditions were a little better in this camp than others because it was an exchange camp. The night before my father died, we were told that we were being exchanged. My father died thinking that his daughters were going to be free. But, the next day, after my father died, they changed their minds, and we remained at Bergen-Belsen.\n\nHow long were you in the camp?\nFrom June 20, 1943, until April 11, 1945, and then ten days in a train until liberation. We were taken three days before liberation out of Bergen-Belsen. The Germans still took us even though they knew the English were very near. The English were so close, we could hear them. The Germans were taking us to be gassed.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nWhen you were in the camp, did you think life would ever return to \"normal\"?\nYes. I hoped the whole time. If you have no hope, you can't survive. We never thought it would take so long. I was in the camp for 22 months.\n\nWas your faith in God the factor that gave you hope and kept you going?\nI had to keep going the whole time because I had to protect my little sister.\n\nHow old were you when you were freed?\nI was sixteen and a half when I was freed.\n\nHow many of your family members were in the death camps? Did anyone survive?\nI started with my grandparents, my father, and my little sister. At the end, only my sister and I survived.\n\nWe weren't killed because we had Palestine Papers, which meant we could be exchanged against German prisoners of war. We also had a passport from Paraguay. Because of the papers and the passports, we weren't sent to death camps like Auschwitz and Sobibor, but to Bergen-Belsen, which we were told was an exchange camp. Unlike the other prisoners, we didn't get numbers on our arms, we didn't get shaved, they didn't take the luggage we brought from home. They didn't divide families. People died from hunger, from typhus, but they were not killed. We could meet with each other.\n\nMy sister had three miracles happen to her. First, when we came to camp in Holland, she got a bad ear infection. She luckily got an operation, or she would have died. Then, when we got to Bergen-Belsen, she got better because it was drier there, which was better for her ears. The second miracle was that during the first few days at Bergen-Belsen, I got jaundice, which is a contagious disease. I needed to go to the hospital, but I was alone with my little sister and I had no one to look after her. A religious Jewish lady heard that I didn't know what to do with my sister. Her name was Mrs. Abrahams. She had seven children already, and still she said, \"If you really don't have anyone to take care of your sister, I'll do it because your father always helped other people. The third miracle was that when I got out of the hospital, there was a distribution of a glass of milk twice a week to children under three years old. My sister was three and a quarter. Luckily, there was a rabbi who knew my father from Berlin, and it was his wife's job to distribute the milk. He said if there is any left, give to this little girl \u2014 my sister. The lady could've drunk it herself, given to her own children, or exchanged it for clothing, but she gave it to my sister. Two glasses of milk a week, for a girl her age, is the difference between life and death.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nWhen you were in the privileged area of the camp, did you ever help or want to help the people in the unprivileged area?\nWe couldn't help them because we were closed into our area. The people from Auschwitz were put on the other side and we weren't allowed to speak with them. We got infected by lice that they brought from Auschwitz.\n\nHave you visited a concentration camp since WW II?\nYes. I have visited concentration camps three times \u2014 only the ones that I was in: once with my late husband, and twice to help make two films about Anna \u2014 The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank and Anne Frank Remembered. Seeing those camps years later \u2014 they were so different. You needed a lot of imagination to picture it as it was. In fact, they burned Bergen-Belsen down shortly after the liberation because of the typhoid and the lice.\n\nWhat have been the long-term effects of your camp imprisonment?\nI still have nightmares. When my kids were small, I was always worried when they went away that they wouldn't come back. When my husband was in the army, I would worry if he didn't call.\n\n^ Top of Page\nHelping Anne\n\nWere you scared to throw the package over the fence?\nYes, sure I was. A German was in a watchtower at the top of the fence. He wouldn't have asked a lot. He just would have shot me. I wasn't allowed to come near the fence. Not only me, but Anna too.\n\nHow did you convince the other Holocaust prisoners to give up their food so you could give it to Anne?\nI didn't convince anybody to give up their food because nobody had any. At that time I got two little packages of food from the Red Cross. This is the one and only time during my whole two years in the concentration camp that I received food. This happened just at the time that I was speaking to Anna through the fence. So, when I told people that I had a very good friend who was in much worse condition than our bad condition, four or five people gave me a little something. A Swedish bread, dried prunes, a sock, and that was it.\n\nDid you know when you gave Anne the food that it was going to be the last time you saw her?\nI thought we'd be liberated and be together. One day before you are liberated you don't know it's going to be tomorrow. You hope and you don't know which will happen quicker \u2014 that the English will save us or that we will die.\n\n^ Top of Page\nLife After the War\n\nWhat did you have to do to pull your life back together after the war?\nI was sick for a long time after the war. I was liberated on the 23rd of April in a German village by the Russians after ten days in the train. And there we had to live for two months. Then, the Russians allowed Americans to register us and take us out at the end of June 1945. We came back to Amsterdam in July 1945. When we got back, we were examined and I had to go to the hospital. I was first at a hospital in Holland. That's when I saw Otto Frank and learned that Anne had died. Then, I went to a hospital in Amsterdam for almost all of September. On December 5, 1945, I was sent to Switzerland. First I stayed at a sanitarium in the mountains, and when I was well, I went to Basel for one year to go to school. I was one year in Basel. In May 1947 my uncle got me a certificate to go to Palestine. I came to Palestine on May 30. For the first three months in Palestine, I was at a home for children. I was eighteen, so I worked half of the day. For the other half of the day I had Hebrew lessons, which I needed in order to be a nurse. In October 1947, I went to Jerusalem to be educated as a children's nurse.\n\nAre any of your \"ping-pong club\" childhood friends still living?\nOnly Jopi \u2014 Jacqueline Sanders.\n\nHow did you learn of Anne's and Margot's deaths?\nAfter the war, when I had to stay in a hospital in Holland to recover, Mr. Frank came to see me. I was so happy to tell him that I spoke with his daughter. I told him that maybe she is still alive. But he said that no, both of his daughters were dead. I was SO sorry, so very sad to hear this.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nHow often did you keep in touch with Mr. Frank after the war?\nI always stayed in touch with Mr. Frank until his death. We were always corresponding. I used to call him Oom Otto \u2014 Uncle Otto. He visited us also several times in Israel with his second wife.\n\nHow did you recover from your losses after the war?\nI had no choice but to go on \u2014 especially for my little sister. When your young, it's easier. I married, had children, and lived in the new free Palestine. It must've been harder for older people. As an older person, it comes back to you.\n\nHave you ever been back to Germany or Holland?\nYes, I was in Germany to make films about Anne Frank and I was in eastern Germany to speak to kids about the Holocaust. I was in Holland with my late husband visiting and also for a film about Anne Frank. I'm going to Holland again on September 17 to open the renovated Anne Frank House.\n\nDo you believe you are a more compassionate person as a result of your experiences?\nI try to be compassionate, but I'm not sure it's the result of war.\n\nWhat do you feel is most important for people to be educated about in terms of the Holocaust?\nTo think about why did it happen at all. We were just children. They started to make a war on us \u2014 took our freedom without any reason. People should know about the cruelty \u2014 it was unnecessary. It's important to understand what happened so it doesn't happen again. People need to understand that discrimination doesn't lead to anything good. I always say that the only thing Anne Frank did was that she was born Jewish, and for that she had to die. She could've given a lot to mankind.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nDo you believe we can learn and understand the pain that you went through by watching Schindler's List?\nYou can learn a little, but it takes imagination because the Holocaust was so bad and poor.\n\nHow do you respond to people like David Duke, who deny the Holocaust existed?\nYou can't have a discussion with these people. I don't even try to speak with them.\n\nHistory often repeats itself. How can another Holocaust be prevented?\nI really don't know. Look at Kosovo. Maybe we have to try more. We should know that if people are different religions and races, we need to respect each other. Children need to learn tolerance from a young age.\n\n^ Top of Page\nThe Diary & Remembering Anne\n\nHow did you react when you found out that Anne died?\nI was very, very sad. The whole time I hoped she was alive. I saw her alive so near to the end, I just assumed she made it. When I first saw Mr. Frank, I told him that Anne was alive, but he knew she wasn't. He told me she died.\n\nDo you know of any other diaries written by children during WW II?\nSome diaries were found, but years later. Anne's was the first discovered and her father immediately published it. One of the diaries that was found later on was written by a boy by the name of Moshe Flinker. He was in Belgium. He died too.\n\nIs Anne as famous in your country as she is in the rest of the world?\nAnne is popular in Israel. There's even a stamp with her face on it. Every year, on Holocaust Day \u2014 in early May (27 Ijar in the Hebrew calendar) \u2014 there are films all day about the Holocaust and there are always some about Anne Frank.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the things that Anne wrote about you in her diary? Did you feel that the Anne in the diary was a different person from the one that you knew?\nSure, Anna was a different person in the diary. She was much more mature. I really didn't know the Anna in the diary before. I didn't know that she was so deep, so able to observe things and people around her. Her father said the same. The things she wrote about me, maybe they weren't so nice in the revised edition, but at my age now, I can laugh at the things she wrote. Maybe she was probably right. If I can convince just one person that Anna's diary is real, then okay, they should laugh at me.\n\n^ Top of Page\n\nWhat do you feel about Anne's dream that she wrote about in her diary on November 27, 1943, in which you were the one dying and not her?\nAnna's dream gives me the motivation to talk about her life today, and to tell people her story. Anna wanted to be famous and now I can do that for her. Today, I'm alive, a proud grandmother, and I feel obliged to tell about her. I'm happy that through this, people can learn about the Holocaust. When you read only the diary, you don't learn about the Holocaust, only what happened before.\n\nHow does it make you feel that Anne has got so much publicity over the diary?\nI'm happy that people hear about the Holocaust. I don't care how they know. Through Anne, lots of people learn about what the Germans did to the Jewish people.\n\nAt any special time, do you feel Anne's presence?\nI often feel Anne's presence with me because I go around speaking about her very often.\n\nHanneli, do you have any final words for the audience?\nI think that people have to try and live in peace together. If you want to learn more about me, you can read my book. It's called Reflections of a Childhood Friend: Memories of Anne Frank by Alison Leslie Gold. It's published by Scholastic. There's another book by Anchor Books called The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank.

Both Hannah and Anne had attended the Sixth Public Montessori School (now the Anne Frank School) in Amsterdam and then the Jewish Lyceum.\n\n==Early life==\nHanneli Elizabeth Pick-Goslar was born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], on 12 November, 1928, the eldest child of Hans Goslar and Ruth Judith Klee.<ref>[[Alison Leslie Gold]], ''Hannah Goslar Remembers: A Childhood Friend of Anne Frank'',p. 80</ref> Her father was deputy minister for domestic affairs in Germany until 1933<ref>H. Pick-Goslar in W. Lindwer, ''The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank'', p. 12</ref> and her mother was a teacher. Both of her parents were observant [[Jews]]. Her mother died giving birth to her third child; the baby was stillborn. In 1933, after the election of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] to the Reichstag and Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, Hans Goslar was forced to resign his governmental job.<ref> Lindwer, p. 12</ref> After an abortive attempt to move to [[England]], where Hans Goslar could not find work that would allow him to stay home on the [[Shabbat]], the Goslars moved to [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. Hannah attended the Sixth Public [[Montessori]] school in Amsterdam, where she became best friends with [[Anne Frank]]. Anne and Hannah were also best and close friends with [[Sanne Ledermann|Susanne \"Sanne\" Ledermann]], who lived in the same area but attended a different school, and later with [[Ilse Wagner]] and [[Jacqueline van Maarsen]].<ref> Frank, Anne, ''The Diary of a Young Girl''(definitive edition 1995), p.2</ref>\n\n==Arrest and concentration camp life==\n\nIn 1943, Hannah, her father, her maternal grandparents, along with Hannah's younger sister Gabrielle (\"Gabi\"), were arrested and sent to the [[Westerbork transit camp]], and then eventually to the exchange camp of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Hannah was in a privileged section of the camp because her family had [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine passports]] with them. Sometime between January-February 1945, Hannah was briefly reunited with Anne Frank, who was a less privileged prisoner imprisoned at the other side of the camp. Hannah passed Anne a package with some bread and socks in it. Hannah and Gabi survived 14 months at Bergen-Belsen. Her father and maternal grandparents died of illnesses before the liberation. Hannah and Gabi were the only members of their family to survive the war, and in 1947, they [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to the [[Land of Israel]], settling in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n==Present life==\nHannah married Dr. Walter Pinchas Pick, and they have three children. Hannah still lives in [[Jerusalem]] and she has eleven grandchildren and over 20 great-grandchildren.\n\nHannah has appeared in several documentaries related to [[Anne Frank]], first in the 1988 Emmy Award winning documentary by Willy Lindwer ''[[Laatste Zeven Maanden van Anne Frank (TV documentary)|The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank]]'', the 1995 documentary ''[[Anne Frank Remembered]]'' and the 2008 documentary ''Classmates of Anne Frank''. <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1329123/</ref> The book ''Memories of Anne Frank: Reflections of a Childhood Friend,'' by Holocaust author [[Alison Leslie Gold]], is based upon extensive interviews with Hannah.\n\n==See also==\n* Documentary film by Willy Lindwer: The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank, 1988 International EMMY AWARD\n*[[People associated with Anne Frank]]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246430/ Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001)]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Memories-Anne-Frank-Reflections-Childhood/dp/0590907220 Memories of Anne Frank: nonfiction book detailing Goslar's experience during the Holocaust]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321867/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Memories of Anne Frank (2009 film)]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4437054/?ref_=tt_urv Meine Tochter Anne Frank (2015)]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://teacher.scholastic.com/frank/tscripts/hanneli.htm Interview with Hanneli Pick-Goslar]\n\n{{Anne Frank}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goslar, Hanneli}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:Bergen-Belsen concentration camp survivors]]\n[[Category:Dutch emigrants to Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:German emigrants to the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:German Jews]]\n[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\n[[Category:People from Berlin]]\n[[Category:People from Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Dutch Ashkenazi Jews]]\n[[Category:Women in World War II]]\n[[Category:Jewish concentration camp survivors]]\n[[Category:Israeli nurses]]\n", "name_user": "97.100.143.4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanneli_Goslar"}

Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist [[Brian Connolly]], bass player [[Steve Priest]], guitarist [[Andy Scott (guitarist)|Andy Scott]], and drummer [[Mick Tucker]]. The group was originally called '''Sweetshop'''.\n\nThe band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \"Funny Funny\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters [[Nicky Chinn]] and [[Mike Chapman]] and record producer [[Phil Wainman]]. During 1971 and 1972, their musical style followed a marked progression from [[the Archies]]-like [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] style of \"Funny Funny\" to a [[The Who|Who]]-influenced hard rock style supplemented by a striking use of high-pitched backing vocals.\n\nThe band first achieved success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, with \"[[Block Buster!]]\" (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number two hits in \"Hell Raiser\" (1973), \"[[The Ballroom Blitz]]\" (1973) and \"Teenage Rampage\" (1974). The band turned to a more [[hard rock]] style with their mid-career singles, like 1974's \"[[Turn It Down (Sweet song)|Turn It Down]]\". \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\" (1975) also reached number two on the UK charts. These results were topped in West Germany and other countries on the European mainland. They also achieved success and popularity in the US with the top ten hits \"[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]\", \"The Ballroom Blitz\", \"Fox on the Run\" and \"Love is Like Oxygen\".\n\nSweet had their last international success in 1978 with \"[[Love Is Like Oxygen]]\". Connolly left the group in 1979 to start a solo career and the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1981. From the mid-1980s, Scott, Connolly and Priest each played with their own versions of Sweet at different times. Connolly died in 1997 and Tucker in 2002. The two surviving members are still active in their respective versions of the band; Scott's is based in the UK and Priest's in the US. They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nSweet's origins can be traced back to British [[soul music|soul]] band Wainwright's Gentlemen. Mark Lay's history of that band states they formed around 1962 and were initially known as Unit 4. Founding members included Chris Wright (vocals), Jan Frewer (bass), with Jim Searle and Alfred Fripp on guitars. Phil Kenton joined on drums as the band changed its name to Wainwright's Gentlemen (due to there being another band known as [[Unit 4 + 2|Unit 4]]). Managed by Frewer's father, the band performed in the [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Wembley]] area. By 1964 the group was also playing in London, including at the Saint Germain Club in Poland Street.\n\nIn January 1964 the band came fifth in a national beat group contest, with finals held at the Lyceum Strand on 4 May 1964. Highlights of the show were presented on BBC1 by [[Alan Freeman]]. Chris Wright left the line-up in late 1964 and was replaced by [[Ian Gillan]]. A female vocalist named Ann Cully joined the band soon after. Mick Tucker, from [[Ruislip]], joined on drums replacing Phil Kenton. The band recorded a number of tracks including a cover of the Coasters-[[the Hollies]]' hit \"Ain't That Just Like Me\", which was probably recorded at Jackson Sound Studios in [[Rickmansworth]]. The track includes Gillan on vocals, Tucker on drums and, according to band bassist Jan Frewer, is thought to have been recorded in 1965. Gillan quit in May 1965 to join [[Episode Six]], and later, [[Deep Purple]]. Cully remained on as vocalist before departing some time later. Gillan's and Cully's eventual replacement, in late 1966, was Scots-born vocalist Brian Connolly, who hailed more recently from [[Harefield]]. Tony Hall had joined on saxophone and vocals and when Fripp left he was replaced by Gordon Fairminer. Fairminer's position was eventually assumed by Frank Torpey - a schoolfriend of Tucker's who had just left West London group The Tribe (aka The Dream). Torpey only lasted a few months, and in late 1967 Robin Box took his place. Searle, regarded by many as the most talented musically, disappeared from the scene. Tucker and Connolly remained with Wainwright's Gentlemen until January 1968. Tucker was replaced by Roger Hills. When the Gentlemen eventually broke up, Hills and Box joined [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]] who eventually scored a big hit with \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\".\n\n===Early years===\nIn January 1968 Connolly and Tucker formed a new band calling themselves The Sweetshop. They recruited [[Bassist|bass guitarist]] and vocalist Steve Priest from a local band called The Army. Priest had previously played with mid-60's band the Countdowns who had been produced and recorded by Joe Meek. Frank Torpey was again recruited to play guitar. The quartet made its public debut at the Pavilion in [[Hemel Hempstead]] on 9 March 1968 and soon developed a following on the pub circuit, which led to a contract with [[Fontana Records]]. At the time, another UK band released a single under the same name Sweetshop, so the band abbreviated their moniker to The Sweet. The band was managed by [[Paul Nicholas]], who later went on to star in ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Nicholas worked with record producer [[Phil Wainman]] at Mellin Music Publishing and recommended the band to him. Their debut single \"Slow Motion\" (July 1968), produced by Wainman, and released on Fontana, failed to [[record chart|chart]] and owing to its rarity now sells for several hundred pounds when auctioned. Sweet were released from the [[recording contract]] and Frank Torpey left. In his autobiography ''Are You Ready Steve'', Priest said that Gordon Fairminer was approached to play for them when Torpey decided to leave Sweet after a gig at Playhouse Theatre [[Walton-on-Thames]] on 5 July 1969 but turned the job down as he wanted to concentrate on other interests.\n\n===New line-up and new record deal===\nGuitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with [[Errol Dixon]]. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with [[Johnny Kidd & The Pirates]].\n\nThe Sweet signed a new record contract with [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \"Lollipop Man\" (September 1969), \"All You'll Ever Get from Me\" (January 1970), and a [[cover version]] of [[the Archies]]' \"Get on the Line\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, [[Nicky Chinn]] and [[Mike Chapman]], who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \"Funny Funny\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with [[Mike McCartney]] (brother of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]) in [[the Scaffold]]. As a member of [[the Elastic Band]], he had played guitar on two singles for [[Decca Records|Decca]], \"Think of You Baby\" and \"Do Unto Others\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, ''Expansions on Life'', and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in [[Redcar]].\n\nThe Sweet initially attempted to combine diverse musical influences, including [[the Monkees]] and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of [[the Hollies]], with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the [[glam metal]] of a few years later.\n\nThe Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] as part of a compilation called ''[[Gimme Dat Ding (album)|Gimme Dat Ding]]'', released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; [[the Pipkins]] (whose sole hit, \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the [[A-side and B-side|A- and B-sides]] of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.\n\n===First album===\nThe Sweet made their UK television debut in December 1970 on a pop show called ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea|Lift Off]]'', performing the song \"Funny Funny\". A management deal was signed with the aforementioned songwriting team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. Phil Wainman resumed his collaboration with Sweet, as executive producer. This management deal also included a worldwide (the U.S. excepted) record contract with [[RCA Records]] (in the United States and Canada [[Bell Records]] issued the group's music until late 1973; followed by [[Capitol Records]]).\n\nIn March 1971 RCA issued \"Funny Funny\", written by Chinn and Chapman, which became the group's first international hit, climbing to the Top 20 on many of the world's charts. EMI reissued their 1970 single \"All You'll Ever Get from Me\" (May 1971) and it again failed to chart. Their next RCA release \"[[Co-Co (Sweet song)|Co-Co]]\" (June 1971) went to number two in the U.K. and their follow up single, \"Alexander Graham Bell\" (October 1971), only went to No. 33.<ref name=\"UK chart\">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/sweet/ Sweet UK chart history], The Official Charts Company. Retrieved 18 June 2012.</ref> These tracks still featured session musicians on the instruments with the quartet providing only the vocals.\n\nThe Sweet's first full LP album, ''[[Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be]]'', was released in November 1971. A collection of the band's recent singles supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including \"Chop Chop\" and \"Tom Tom Turnaround\") and pop covers (such as [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]'s \"[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]\" and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[Reflections (The Supremes song)|Reflections]]\"), the album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts. Their albums' failure to match the success of their singles was a problem that would plague the band throughout their career.\n\n===Initial success and rise to fame===\nFebruary 1972 saw the release of \"Poppa Joe\", which reached number 1 in Finland and peaked at number 11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> The next two singles of that year, \"[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]\" and \"[[Wig-Wam Bam]]\", both reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK,<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> and \"Little Willy\" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] after a re-issue in 1973, thus becoming the group's biggest American hit. Although \"Wig-Wam Bam\" remained largely true to the style of the Sweet's previous recordings, the vocals and guitars had a harder, more rock-oriented sound, largely because it was the first Chinn-Chapman single on which only members of Sweet played the instruments. In January 1973 \"[[Block Buster!]]\" became the Sweet's first single to reach number 1 on the UK chart, remaining there for five consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> After their next single \"Hell Raiser\" was released in May and reached number 2 in the U.K., the Sweet's U.S. label, Bell, released the group's first American album ''[[The Sweet (album)|The Sweet]]'' in July 1973.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/>\n\nTo promote their singles, the Sweet made numerous appearances on U.K. and European TV shows such as ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Supersonic (TV series)|Supersonic]]''. In one performance of \"Block Buster!\" on ''Top of the Pops'' Christmas edition, Priest aroused complaints after he appeared replete in a German military uniform, Hitler moustache and displaying a [[swastika]] armband.<ref>''[[Top of the Pops]]'', January 1973 - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgiDINcZ-q4 YouTube]</ref> The band also capitalised on the glam rock explosion, rivalling [[Gary Glitter]], [[T.Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Slade]], and [[Wizzard]] for outrageous stage clothing.\n\nDespite the Sweet's success, the relationship with their management was becoming increasingly tense. While they had developed a large fan-base among teenagers, the Sweet were not happy with their '[[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]]' image. The Sweet had always composed their own heavy-rock songs on the B-sides of their singles to contrast with the bubblegum A-sides which were composed by Chinn and Chapman. During this time, Sweet's live performances consisted of B-sides, album tracks, and various medleys of [[rock and roll]] classics; they avoided older 'novelty' hits like \"Funny Funny\" and \"Poppa Joe\". A 1973 performance at the Palace Theatre and Grand Hall in [[Kilmarnock]] ended in the Sweet being bottled off stage; the disorder was attributed by some (including Steve Priest) to the Sweet's lipstick and eye-shadow look, and by others to the audience being unfamiliar with the concert set (the 1999 CD release ''[[Live at the Rainbow 1973]]'' documents a live show from this period). The incident would be immortalised in the hit \"[[The Ballroom Blitz]]\" (September 1973). In the meantime, the Sweet's chart success continued, showing particular strength in the UK, [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and Australia. At the end of 1973, the band's name evolved from \"The Sweet\" to \"Sweet\". The change would be reflected in all of their releases from 1974 onward.\n\n===Forming a new image===\nBy 1974, Sweet had grown tired of the management team of Chinn and Chapman, who wrote the group's major hits and cultivated the band's glam rock image. The group and producer Phil Wainman, assisted by engineer Peter Coleman, recorded the album ''[[Sweet Fanny Adams (album)|Sweet Fanny Adams]]'', which was released in April 1974. Sweet's technical proficiency was demonstrated for the first time on self-penned hard rock tracks such as \"Sweet F.A.\" and \"Set Me Free\". Sweet also adopted a more conventional [[hard rock]] sound and appearance. ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' also featured compressed high-pitched backing vocal [[harmony|harmonies]], which was a trend that continued on all of Sweet's albums.\n\nDuring sessions for the album, Brian Connolly was injured in a fight in [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]] High Street. His throat was badly injured and his ability to sing severely limited. Priest and Scott filled in on lead vocals on some tracks (\"No You Don't\", \"Into The Night\" and \"Restless\") and Connolly, under treatment from a [[Harley Street]] specialist, managed to complete the album. The band did not publicise the incident and told the press that subsequent cancelled shows were due to Connolly having a throat infection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesweetweb.com/8-giglists/15-gigs1974 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930115708/http://www.thesweetweb.com/8-giglists/15-gigs1974 |archive-date=30 September 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This incident reportedly permanently compromised Connolly's singing ability, with his range diminished.\n\nNo previous singles appeared on the album, and none were released, except in [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], where \"[[Peppermint Twist]]/Rebel Rouser\", apparently released by their record company without their knowledge, gained a No. 1 chart position in the latter. ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' would be Sweet's only non-compilation release to break the [[UK Albums Chart]] Top 40.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/>\n\nSweet were invited by [[Pete Townshend]] to support [[the Who]], who were playing at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s football ground, [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] in June 1974. However, Connolly's badly bruised throat kept them from fulfilling the role. Sweet had frequently cited the Who as being one of their main influences and played a medley of their tracks in their live set for many years.\n\n===''Desolation Boulevard''===\nTheir third album, ''[[Desolation Boulevard]]'', was released later in 1974, six months after ''Sweet Fanny Adams''. By that stage, producer Phil Wainman had moved on and the album was produced by Mike Chapman. It was recorded in a mere six days and featured a rawer \"live\" sound. One track, \"[[(Themes from) The Man with the Golden Arm|The Man with the Golden Arm]]\", written by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and [[Sylvia Fine]] for the 1955 [[Frank Sinatra]] movie of the same name, featured drummer Mick Tucker performing an 8 and half minute solo (although this was not included in the U.S. release). This had been a staple of the band's live performance for years. The first single from the LP, the heavy-melodic \"The Six Teens\" (July 1974), was a Top 10 hit in the U.K.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> and still part of the amazing unbroken string of No. 1's in Denmark. However, the subsequent single release, \"Turn It Down\" (November 1974), reached only No. 41 on the U.K. chart and No. 2 in Denmark.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> \"Turn It Down\" received minimal [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] on UK radio and was banned by some radio stations because of certain [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content - \"God-awful sound\" and \"For God sakes, turn it down\" - which were deemed \"unsuitable for family listening.\" The band resumed playing live shows nearly a full six months after Connolly's throat injury, with band and critics noting a rougher edge to his voice and a reduced range. The album also featured a group composition, \"Fox On The Run\", which was to be re-recorded months later.\n\nThe U.S. version of ''Desolation Boulevard'' was different from the U.K. version and included several songs from ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' in addition to the \"Ballroom Blitz\" and \"Fox on the Run\" singles (both of which peaked at No. 5 in the US). Side One of the album contained all Chapman-Chinn penned songs, while Side Two featured songs written and produced by Sweet.\n\n===Writing and producing their own material===\nIn 1975 Sweet went back into the studio to re-arrange and record a more pop-oriented version of the track \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\". Sweet's first self-written and produced single, \"Fox on the Run\" was released worldwide in March 1975 and became their biggest selling hit, reaching number one in Germany, Denmark, and [[South Africa]], number two in the United Kingdom, [[Ireland]], [[Norway]] and the [[Netherlands]] and number three in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. In Australia it not only made it to the top of the charts, it also became the biggest selling single of that year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Mark|title=Australian Singles Chart For 1975|url=http://www.australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1975/|publisher=Australian Music History|accessdate=29 November 2010|date=5 September 2007}}</ref> The song reached number two in Canada and number five in the U.S. The release of this track marked the end of the formal Chinn-Chapman working relationship and the band stressed it was now fully self-sufficient as writers and producers.\n\nThe following single release, \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" (July 1975), peaked at number 15 in the UK. Now confident in their own songwriting and production abilities, Sweet spent the latter half of 1975 in [[Musicland Studios]] in [[Munich]], Germany, where they recorded the ''[[Give Us A Wink]]'' album with German [[audio engineer|sound engineer]] [[Reinhold Mack]], who later recorded with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and co-produced [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. The new album release was deferred until 1976 so as not to stifle the chart success ''Desolation Boulevard'' was enjoying, peaking at number 25 in the US and number 5 in Canada.\n\nWith ''Give Us a Wink'' being held over, RCA issued a [[double album]] in Europe, ''[[Strung Up (Sweet album)|Strung Up]]'', in November. It contained one live disc, recorded in London in December 1973, and one disc compiling previously released single tracks (plus an unused track by Chinn and Chapman \u2013 \"I Wanna Be Committed\"). At the end of the year, Andy Scott released his first solo single, \"Lady Starlight\" b/w \"Where D'Ya Go\". Tucker played drums on both tracks.\n\n===Decline in popularity===\nJanuary 1976 saw the release of the single \"The Lies In Your Eyes\", which made the Top 10 in Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia, but only reached No.&nbsp;35 on the U.K. charts. Sweet's first album to be fully produced and written by themselves, ''[[Give Us A Wink]]'', was released in March 1976. A third single from the album, \"4th&nbsp;Of&nbsp;July\", was issued in Australia.\n\nBy this time, Sweet strove to build on their growing popularity in America with a schedule of more than fifty headline concert dates. Even though ''Give Us A Wink''{{'}}s release was imminent, the band's set essentially promoted the US version of ''Desolation Boulevard'' plus the new US hit single \"Action\". During an appearance at [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in California on 24 March, Sweet played \"[[All Right Now]]\" with [[Ritchie Blackmore]] as a tribute to mark the death of [[Free (band)|Free]] guitarist [[Paul Kossoff]], who was to have supported Sweet with his band [[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]]. The US tour was not financially successful, with small audiences at many venues leading to the final half-dozen or so dates to be cancelled. Following the end of the  tour, the band went on to [[Scandinavia]] and Germany. The band also spent a week at [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] in [[Battersea]] demoing material for a new album before abandoning that project and playing eight dates in Japan. By the end of the Japanese shows Connolly's extremely hoarse singing voice was manifest evidence of the demands of constant touring and the enduring after-effects of his 1974 assault.\n\nBetween October 1976 and January 1977, Sweet wrote and recorded new material at Kingsway Recorders and Audio International London studios for their next album. An advance single from the album, \"Lost Angels\", was only a hit in Germany,<ref name=\"German chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Sweet/24734/single |title=Chartverfolgung / Sweet / Single |work=Music Line |publisher=[[Media Control Charts]] |location=[[Germany]] |language=German |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> Austria and Sweden. A new album, ''[[Off the Record (Sweet album)|Off the Record]]'', was released in April. The next single from the album, \"Fever of Love\", represented the band heading in a somewhat more Europop hard rock direction, once again charting in Germany,<ref name=\"German chart\"/> Austria and Sweden, while reaching number 10 in South Africa. On this album, Sweet again worked with ''Give Us A Wink'' engineer Louis Austin, who would later engineer [[Def Leppard]]'s ''[[On Through The Night]]'' 1980 d\u00e9but album. The band cancelled a US tour with emerging US rockers [[Aerosmith]], did not play any live dates in support of the album and, in fact, did not play a single concert for the whole of 1977.\n\n===''Level Headed'' and a change in style===\nSweet left RCA in 1977 and signed a new deal with [[Polydor]] though it would not come into force until later in the year. Sweet's manager David Walker, from Handle Artists, negotiated the move which was reputed to be worth around \u00a3750,000. In the United States, Canada and Japan Capitol had issued Sweet's albums since 1974 and would continue to do so through 1980.\n\nThe first Polydor album, ''[[Level Headed]]'' (January 1978), found Sweet experimenting by combining rock and classical sounds \"''a-la clavesin''\", an approach similar to [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s, and featured the single \"Love Is Like Oxygen\". Largely recorded during 1977 at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] near [[Paris, France]] after a 30 day writing session at [[Clearwell Castle]] in the [[Forest of Dean|Forest Of Dean]] UK, the album represented a new musical direction, largely abandoning hard-rock for a more melodic pop style, interspersed with ballads accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra. The ballad, \"Lettres D'Amour\", featured a duet between Connolly and [[Stevie Lange]] (who would emerge as lead singer with the group [[Night (rock band)|Night]] in 1979).\n\nWith the addition of session and touring musicians keyboardist Gary Moberley and guitarist Nico Ramsden, Sweet undertook a short European and Scandinavian tour followed by a single British concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 24 February 1978. However, \"[[Love Is Like Oxygen]]\" (January 1978) was their last U.K., U.S., and German Top 10 hit.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/><ref name=\"German chart\"/> Scott was nominated for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for co-composing the song. One more single from the album, \"California Nights\" (May 1978), featuring Steve Priest as the lead vocalist, peaked at number 23 on the German charts.\n\n===Departure of Brian Connolly===\nBetween March and May 1978 Sweet extensively toured the US, as a support act for [[Bob Seger]] and the Silver Bullet Band. The tour included a disastrous date in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on 3 May, during which visiting Capitol Records executives in the audience saw Brian Connolly give a drunken and incoherent performance that terminated early in the set with his collapse on stage, leaving the rest of the group to play on without him. The band returned briefly to Britain before resuming the second leg of their US tour in late May supporting other acts, including [[Foghat]] and [[Alice Cooper]]. Concluding the US tour in early July 1978, Brian's alcoholism and estrangement from the group was steadily becoming a greater issue.\n\nIn late October, having spent further time at Clearwell Castle to write for their next album, Sweet arrived at The Town House studio in [[Shepherds Bush]], London to complete and record, ''[[Cut Above the Rest]]'' (April 1979). Due to tensions between various members attributed to Connolly's health and diminishing status with the group, his long-time friend and fellow founding member, Mick Tucker, was tasked to produce Connolly's vocals. It was felt Tucker would extract a better performance than Scott from Connolly. A number of tracks were recorded featuring Connolly. However, these efforts were deemed unsatisfactory and Brian left the band on 2 November 1978.\n\nOn 23 February 1979, Brian Connolly's departure from Sweet was formally announced by manager David Walker. Publicly, Connolly was said to be pursuing a solo career with an interest in recording [[country rock]].\n\n===Three piece Sweet===\nSweet continued as a trio with Priest assuming the lion's share of lead vocals, though Scott and Tucker were also active in that role. The first single release for the trio was \"Call Me\". Guest [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] player Gary Moberley continued to augment the group on stage. Guitarist Ray McRiner joined their touring line-up in 1979, with a small tour with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] in the eastern United States and [[Cheap Trick]] in Texas in the spring and summer of '79 to support ''Cut Above The Rest'' (which was released in April 1979). McRiner would also contribute the songs \"Too Much Talking\" and the single \"Give The Lady Some Respect\" to the next Sweet album, ''[[Waters Edge]]'' (August 1980), which was recorded in Canada. In the US, ''Waters Edge'' was titled ''Sweet VI''. It featured the singles \"Sixties Man\" and \"Give The Lady Some Respect\". Tragedy befell Mick Tucker when his wife Pauline drowned in the bath at their home on 26 December 1979. The band withdrew from live work for all of 1980.\n\nOne more studio album, ''[[Identity Crisis (Sweet album)|Identity Crisis]]'', was recorded during 1980\u201381 but was only released in West Germany and Mexico. Sweet undertook a short tour of the UK and performed their last live show at [[Glasgow]] University on 20 March 1981. Steve Priest then returned to the United States, where he had been living since late 1979. When Polydor released ''Identity Crisis'' in October 1982, the original Sweet had been disbanded for almost a year.\n\n==Re-formed versions (1984\u2013present)==\n===Andy Scott's Sweet (1985\u2013present)===\nAndy Scott and Mick Tucker organised their own version of Sweet with [[Paul Mario Day]] (ex-[[Iron Maiden]], [[More (band)|More]], Wildfire) on lead vocals, [[Phil Lanzon]] (ex-Grand Prix) on keyboards and [[Mal McNulty]] on bass. The band performed at the [[Marquee Club]] in London in February 1986, with the shows recorded and gaining release a few years later, bolstered by four new studio tracks including a cover of the [[Motown]] standard \"[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]\". This line-up also toured Australian and New Zealand pubs and clubs for more than three months in 1985 and for a similar period again in 1986. Singer Paul Mario Day ended up marrying the band's Australian tour guide and relocating downunder. He continued with Sweet commuting back and forth to Europe for the group's tours until this proved to be too cumbersome. He departed in late 1988. As McNulty moved into the front man spot, Jeff Brown came in to take over bass early in 1989. Lanzon too went back and forth between Sweet and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] during 1986-1988 before Heep's schedule grew too busy. Malcolm Pearson and then Ian Gibbons (who had played with [[The Kinks]] and [[The Records]]) both filled in for Lanzon until Steve Mann (Liar, [[Lionheart (UK band)|Lionheart]], [[McAuley Schenker Group]]) arrived in December 1989.\n\nTucker departed after a show in [[Lochau]], [[Austria]], on 5 May 1991. He later was diagnosed with a rare form of [[leukaemia]]. Three drummers, Andy Hoyler, Bobby Andersen and Bruce Bisland (Weapon, Wildfire, [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]]), provided short-term relief before Bodo Schopf ([[McAuley Schenker Group]]) took over. They recorded an album during this period, simply titled ''A''. Before the band embarked on the supporting tour for ''A''  in 1992, Bodo left and Bisland returned as permanent percussionist. Scott changed the band's name to 'Andy Scott's Sweet' after Tucker's departure but truncated it to simply 'The Sweet' once again after Tucker's death in 2002.\n\n[[Mal McNulty]], now lead vocalist, departed in 1994, though he would return briefly that year to fill in for Jeff Brown on bass (as he would again in 1995 as lead singer for a few dates while Rocky Newton subbed on bass). Sweet's former keyboard men Gary Moberley and Ian Gibbons also did fill-in jaunts with the group that year, as did Chris Goulstone. Chad Brown (ex-[[Lionheart (UK band)|Lionheart]]; no relation to Jeff) was the new front man. ''Glitz Blitz and Hitz'', a new studio album of re-recorded Sweet hits, was released during this period.\n\nIn 1996 Mann left to take a job in television and Gibbons came back for a short time before Steve Grant (ex-[[The Animals]]) became the permanent keyboardist. When Chad Brown quit in 1998 after developing a throat infection, Jeff Brown assumed lead vocals and bass duties. After this, the band was stable again for the next five years.\n\nThe mid-2000s would bring further confusing shake-ups and rotations. Tony O'Hora (ex-[[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]], [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]]) replaced Brown as lead vocalist in 2003. [[Ian Gibbons (musician)|Ian Gibbons]] came back for a third stint as fill-in keyboardist in June 2005 for a gig in the [[Faroe Islands]]. O'Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while [[Jo Burt]] (ex-[[Black Sabbath]]) was temporary bass player. [[Tony Mills (musician)|Tony Mills]] (ex-[[Shy (band)|Shy]]) was slated to be Sweet's new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, O'Hora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-[[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]) arrived in July 2006. The line-up then consisted of Scott, Bisland, Grant and Lincoln.\n\nScott produced the [[Suzi Quatro]] album ''[[Back to the Drive]]'', released in February 2006. March 2006 saw the U.S. release of his band's album ''Sweetlife''.\n\nIn 2007 the group played in Germany, Belgium, Austria and Italy. In May of that year, the band played in [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], their first and only South American shows. The tour was called the 'Sweet Fanny Adams Tour'.\n\nThe band toured again in March 2008 under the name 'Sweet Fanny Adams Revisited Tour'. In May and June, Scott's Sweet were part of the \"Glitz Blitz & 70s Hitz\" tour of the UK alongside [[The Rubettes]] and [[Showaddywaddy]].\n\nIn March and April 2010, Scott was absent from a couple of gigs due to ill health and Martin Mickels stood in. Scott revealed later that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and was treated at the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]]. After a course of treatment and rest, he was back to full touring fitness. In 2010 the band played at venues in Europe and back at [[Bilston]] in October.\n\nIn March 2011 there was a short tour of Australia, Regal Theatre - Perth,  and Clipsal 500, Adelaide with the [[Doobie Brothers]]. Also in 2011, Tony O'Hora came back to the group, this time as keyboardist, after Grant departed.\n\nIn March 2012 the band released a new album ''New York Connection''. Recorded in England, it comprised 11 cover versions, including the 2011 single \"Join Together\" and one revamped original recording; the 1972 B-side \"New York Connection\". All the covers either featured 'bits and pieces' of Sweet hits or other artist songs, such as a \"new version of the [[Ramones]] ''[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]'' [which] shared space with samples from \u2018Ballroom Blitz,\u2019 and a take on [[Hello (band)|Hello]]\u2019s ''[[New York Groove]]'' (made famous in the US by [[Ace Frehley]]) featured a sample from [[Jay-Z]]\u2019s ''[[Empire State Of Mind]]'' along with other Sweet references.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/sweet-return-with-new-album-new-york-connection/?trackback=tsmclip |title=Sweet Return With New Album \u2018New York Connection\u2019 |author=Dave Swanson |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the eve of their March 2012 \"Join Together\" tour of Australia, the band undertook an acoustic performance of three tracks, \"New York Groove-Empire State of Mind\", \"Blockbuster\" and \"Peppermint Twist\", in front of a live audience at ABC Radio Studios in East Perth. Shows in [[Perth]], [[Adelaide]], [[Hobart]], [[Geelong]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] featured tracks from the new album for the first time.\n\n[[Paul Manzi]] joined Sweet on their 2014 Australian tour, replacing Tony O'Hora who was absent for personal reasons. Manzi played guitar, keyboard and undertook lead vocals on \"Set Me Free\" and \"AC-DC\" as the band performed shows in regional centres, including outback Western Australia, Darwin and far-north [[Queensland]], [[NSW]] and Victoria during February and March. The band, with O'Hora back in the ranks, returned to Australia in September 2014 as the headlining act for \"Rock The Boat 4\". This was a cruise aboard the ship [[Rhapsody of the Seas]] which departed Sydney and took in [[New Caledonia]] and [[Vanuatu]]. The band played two gigs and various members guested with Australian veteran performers including [[Brian Cadd]] and [[Russell Morris]] and members of [[AC/DC]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Rose Tattoo]] and [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]].\n\nIn June 2015 it was revealed that the band were going on an extensive tour of the UK in late 2015 and that this tour would probably be their last.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.teamrock.com/news/2015-06-03/the-sweet-announce-final-tour |title=The Sweet announce final tour |website=TeamRock.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2015 summer tour dates, Paul Manzi returned to sub for Peter Lincoln who left this online message to the fans: \"There have been a few rumours going around this weekend, so . . . just to say that I am alive and well! The short explanation for my absence is that I need to rest my voice for a few weeks. We are lucky that our good friend Paul Manzi is able to step in, and Tony knows the role of bass player/singer, so the shows can go ahead, and they will be great! I look forward to being back on stage very soon.\"\n\nPete Lincoln duly resumed his role in the band and they continued with extensive live dates, known as the \"Finale\" tour in Germany. \n\nIn 2017 after Andy undertook a successful Australian visit with Suzi Quatro and Don Powell in the side outfit known as QSP, Sweet was again booked for an extensive European tour.\n\n===New Sweet, Brian Connolly's Sweet (1984\u20131997)===\nIn 1984 Brian Connolly formed a new version of the Sweet without any of the other original members. Despite recurring ill health, Connolly toured the UK and Europe with his band, \"Brian Connolly's Sweet\", which was then renamed to \"New Sweet\". His most successful concerts were in West Germany, before and after reunification.\n\nDuring 1987, Connolly met up again with Frank Torpey. Torpey later explained in interviews Connolly was trying to get a German recording deal. The two got on very well and Torpey subsequently invited Connolly to go into the recording studio with him, as an informal project. After much trepidation, Connolly turned up and the track \"Sharontina\" was recorded. This recording would not be released until 1998, appearing on Frank Torpey's album ''Sweeter''.\n\nBy July 1990, plans were made for Connolly and his band to tour Australia in November. During the long flight to Australia, Connolly's health had suffered and he was hospitalised in Adelaide Hospital, allegedly for dehydration and related problems. The rest of the band played a show in Adelaide without him. After being released from the hospital, Connolly joined the other band members in Melbourne for a gig at the Pier Hotel, in Frankston. After several other shows, including one at the Dingley Powerhouse, Connolly and his band played a final date at Melbourne's Greek Theatre. It was felt Connolly's health was sufficient reason for the tour not to be extended, and some of the planned dates were abandoned. Connolly went back to England and his band appeared on The [[Mark Trevorrow|Bob Downe]] Christmas show on 18 December 1990.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Connolly played the European \"oldies\" circuit and occasional outdoor festivals in Europe with his band. On 22 March 1992, a heavy duty tape recorder was stolen from the band's van whilst at a gig in the [[Bristol Hippodrome]] with [[Mud (band)|Mud]]. It contained demos of four new songs, totalling about 20 mixes.\n\nLegal problems were going on in the background over the use of the Sweet name between Connolly and Andy Scott. Both parties agreed to distinguish their group's names to help promoters and fans. The New Sweet went back to being called Brian Connolly's Sweet and Andy Scott's version became Andy Scott's Sweet.\n\nIn 1994, Connolly and his band played in Dubai. He appeared at the Galleria Theatre, [[Hyatt]] Regency. He also performed in Bahrain.\n\nBy this time Connolly had healed the differences with Steve Priest and Mick Tucker, and was invited to the wedding of Priest's eldest daughter, Lisa. At the private function, for which Priest specially flew back to England, Priest and Connolly performed together.\n\nIn 1995, Connolly released a new album entitled ''Let's Go''. His partner Jean, whom he had met a few years earlier, gave birth to a son. Connolly also performed in Switzerland that year.\n\nOn 2 November 1996 British TV Network [[Channel 4]] aired a programme ''Don't Leave Me This Way'', which examined Connolly's time as a pop star with the Sweet, the subsequent decline in the band's popularity, and its impact on Connolly and the other band members. The show revealed Connolly's ill health but also that he was continuing with his concert dates at [[Butlins]]. Connolly and his band had appeared at Butlins a number of times on tour during the early 1990s.\n\nConnolly's final concert was at the Bristol Hippodrome on 5 December 1996, with Slade II and John Rossall's Glitter Band Experience.\n\n===Steve Priest's Sweet (2008\u2013present)===\n<!--This section was initially written on the page [[Steve Priest]]. For earlier editions and credited contributors, see the history on that page.-->\nIn January 2008 Steve Priest assembled his own version of the Sweet in Los Angeles. He enlisted a guitarist [[Stuart Smith (musician)|Stuart Smith]] and L.A. native Richie Onori, Smith's bandmate in Heaven & Earth, was brought in on drums. The keyboard spot was manned by ex-Crow and [[World Classic Rockers]] alumni Stevie Stewart. Front-man and vocalist Joe Retta was brought in to round out the line-up.\n\nAfter an initial appearance on L.A. rock station 95.5 KLOS's popular Mark & Brian radio program, the \"Are You Ready Steve?\" tour kicked off at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood on 12 June 2008. The band spent the next several months playing festivals and gigs throughout the U.S. and Canada, including [[Moondance Jam]] in [[Walker, Minnesota]]; headlining at the [[Rock N Resort Music Festival]] in [[North Lawrence, Ohio]] (near Canal Fulton); [[London, Ontario]]'s [[Rock the Park]]; another headlining gig at Peterborough's Festival of Lights; the Common Ground Festival in [[Lansing, Michigan]]; and a benefit concert for victims of California's wildfires at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn January 2009 the Sweet presented at the concert industry's [[Pollstar]] Awards, and also played a short set at the Nokia Theatre where the event was held, marking the first time in the ceremony's history that a band performed at the show. In addition to local gigs at the [[House of Blues]] on L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]] and [[Universal CityWalk]], 2009 saw the band return to Canada for sold-out shows at the Mae Wilson Theater and [[Casino Regina]], as well as the [[Nakusp Music Fest]] and [[Rockin' the Fields of Minnedosa]] in [[Minnedosa, Manitoba]]. U.S. festivals have included Minnesota's [[Halfway Jam]], Rockin' the Rivers in Montana (with [[Pat Travers]] and [[Peter Frampton]]), and two late-summer shows at the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]].\n\nThe new band recorded a cover version of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Ticket to Ride]]\", which was included on Cleopatra Records' ''Abbey Road'', a Fab Four tribute CD that was released on 24 March 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = Abbey Road | publisher = Cleopatra Records | url = http://www.cleorecs.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=4820&category=0 | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090928060127/http://www.cleorecs.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=4820&category=0 | archivedate = 28 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA preview of the band's new CD ''Live in America'', which was recorded live at the [[Morongo Casino, Resort & Spa]] in [[Cabazon, California]] on 30 August 2008, was featured on KLOS's \"Front Row\" program on 12 April 2009. The CD, which was first sold at shows and via the band's on-line store, was released worldwide in an exclusive deal with Amazon.com on 21 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = Live in America | publisher = Blitz Touring, Inc./Amazon.com | url = https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Live-America/dp/B002GP5VGU | accessdate =7 September 2009}}</ref> The release has garnered favourable reviews from The Rock n Roll Report, Classic Rock Revisited and Hard Rock Haven, among others.\n\nIn April 2010 the band released its first single on [[iTunes]]: an updated, hard rock version of the Beatles' \"[[I Saw Her Standing There]].\"  Performances on the 2010 summer tour included the [[Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival]] in [[Richardson, Texas]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]'s [[Fremont Street Experience]]; Rock N' America in [[Oklahoma City]], OK; Summer Jam in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]; Jack FM's Fifth Show at the [[Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre Irvine|Verizon Wireless Amphitheater]] in Los Angeles; an appearance at the [[Hard Rock Hotel]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]; and the inaugural edition of the Thunder Mountain Rock Festival in [[Sawyer, North Dakota]].\n\nOn 11 November 2010 it was announced that in May 2011 \"Steve Priest's Sweet\" had been booked to perform at a handful of European dates, but the gigs ultimately had to be cancelled in late January 2011 after it was learned that one of the promoters was a suspected swindler wanted by British law enforcement officials. As of February 2011, fans who purchased pre-sale tickets were still in the process of working through the administrative channels with [[PayPal]] and various banks and credit card issuers in order to try to reclaim their funds.\n\nThe band toured [[South America]] along with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] during March 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.requiemweb.com.ar/destacado.php?id=295 |title=Revista Requiem |website=Requiemweb.com.ar |accessdate=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512030534/http://www.requiemweb.com.ar/destacado.php?id=295 |archivedate=12 May 2013  }}</ref>\n\nThe band and their European fans then also got re-united quicker than thought, when the band got booked by a befriended female Belgian promoter. Two east German gigs, 27 and 28 May 2011, so in Borna and in Schwarzenberg Steve Priest's Sweet hit the European grounds. After more than 30 years, Steve Priest got a warm welcome back in Europe.\n\nAs of 12 August 2012, Stuart Smith resigned from the guitar post in order to dedicate more time to his \"Heaven & Earth\" project.\n\nBeginning with the band's October 2012 appearance at the Festival Internacional Chihuahua in Mexico, Los Angeles-based guitarist Ricky Z. teamed up with Steve Priest and company for their live performances. In February 2013, this lineup returned to Casino Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. Tour dates played in summer 2013 included Riverfest in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]], the St. Clair, MI Riverfest, several additional dates in Canada, and a reprise of their appearances at both Moondance Jam in Walker, MN and Rockin' the Rivers in [[Three Forks, Montana]]. The band made some rare appearances on the U.S. east coast in July 2013, including a performance with [[David Johansen]] of the [[New York Dolls]] at the [[Bergen Performing Arts Center]] in [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. Singer Joe Retta was unavailable for these dates due to a scheduling conflict, so Tribe of Gypsies frontman Chas West, who has played with [[Jason Bonham]]'s band and has experience subbing in such well-known bands as [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Lynch Mob]] and [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]], stepped in to man the microphone for a series of shows in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.\n\nOn 27 August 2014, Steve Priest announced on the band's Facebook page that guitarist Mitch Perry had been tapped for the guitar slot. Most recently on tour with [[Lita Ford]], Mitch's other credentials included his work with [[Michael Schenker Group]], [[Asia Featuring John Payne]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Billy Sheehan]] and [[David Lee Roth]] His first live appearance with Sweet was at the Rock the River festival in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] on 23 August 2014.\n\n22 December 2017 saw the launch of the 50th anniversary tour at the Whisky a Go Go on L.A.'s Sunset Strip and the introduction of new singer Paul Zablidowski AKA \"Paulie Z\" former lead singer and guitarist of ZO2, children's band \"The Z Brothers\" and star of IFC show Z-Rock. Recently known as the host for local show \"Ultimate Jam Night.\" Z replaced Joe Retta, who had served as the frontman for the Los Angeles incarnation of Sweet since its formation in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sonicmag.com/sweet-50th-anniversary-tour-paulie-z/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116130526/http://sonicmag.com/sweet-50th-anniversary-tour-paulie-z/ |archive-date=16 January 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thesweetband.com/bio/|title=The Sweet - Official Website (North America) - The Sweet|website=Thesweetband.com|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Brief reunions and the deaths of Brian Connolly and Mick Tucker==\nSteve Priest was asked to join Tucker and Scott for the 1985 Australian tour, but declined at the last moment.\n\nMike Chapman contacted Connolly, Priest, Scott, and Tucker in 1988, offering to finance a recording session in Los Angeles. As he remembers: \"I met them at the airport and Andy and Mick came off the plane. I said, 'Where's Brian?' They said, 'Oh, he's coming.' All the people had come off the plane by now. Then this little old man hobbled towards us. He was shaking, and had a ghostly white face. I thought, 'Oh, Jesus Christ.' It was horrifying.\" Reworked studio versions of \"Action\" and \"The Ballroom Blitz\" were recorded, but it became clear that Connolly's voice and physical health had made Sweet's original member comeback too difficult to promote commercially. Consequently, the reunion attempt was aborted.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/23/sweet-strange-history |title=Glam rock bottom: why did it go so sour for Sweet? |author=David Cavanagh |date=23 September 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 this line-up was again reunited for the promotion of a music documentary entitled ''Sweet's Ballroom Blitz''. This UK video release, which contained UK television performances from the 1970s and current-day interviews, was released at Tower Records, London. Sweet was interviewed by Power Hour, Super Channel, and spoke of a possible reunion.\n\nBrian Connolly died at the age of 51 on 9 February 1997 from liver failure and repeated heart attacks, attributed to his abuse of alcohol in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist [[Brian Connolly]], bass player [[Steve Priest]], guitarist [[Andy Scott (guitarist)|Andy Scott]], and drummer [[Mick Tucker]]. The group was originally called '''Sweetshop'''.\n\nThe band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \"Funny Funny\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters [[Nicky Chinn]] and [[Mike Chapman]] and record producer [[Phil Wainman]]. During 1971 and 1972, their musical style followed a marked progression from [[the Archies]]-like [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] style of \"Funny Funny\" to a [[The Who|Who]]-influenced hard rock style supplemented by a striking use of high-pitched backing vocals.\n\nThe band first achieved success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, with \"[[Block Buster!]]\" (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number two hits in \"Hell Raiser\" (1973), \"[[The Ballroom Blitz]]\" (1973) and \"Teenage Rampage\" (1974). The band turned to a more [[hard rock]] style with their mid-career singles, like 1974's \"[[Turn It Down (Sweet song)|Turn It Down]]\". \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\" (1975) also reached number two on the UK charts. These results were topped in West Germany and other countries on the European mainland. They also achieved success and popularity in the US with the top ten hits \"[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]\", \"The Ballroom Blitz\", \"Fox on the Run\" and \"Love is Like Oxygen\".\n\nSweet had their last international success in 1978 with \"[[Love Is Like Oxygen]]\". Connolly left the group in 1979 to start a solo career and the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1981. From the mid-1980s, Scott, Connolly and Priest each played with their own versions of Sweet at different times. Connolly died in 1997 and Tucker in 2002. The two surviving members are still active in their respective versions of the band; Scott's is based in the UK and Priest's in the US.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nSweet's origins can be traced back to British [[soul music|soul]] band Wainwright's Gentlemen. Mark Lay's history of that band states they formed around 1962 and were initially known as Unit 4. Founding members included Chris Wright (vocals), Jan Frewer (bass), with Jim Searle and Alfred Fripp on guitars. Phil Kenton joined on drums as the band changed its name to Wainwright's Gentlemen (due to there being another band known as [[Unit 4 + 2|Unit 4]]). Managed by Frewer's father, the band performed in the [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Wembley]] area. By 1964 the group was also playing in London, including at the Saint Germain Club in Poland Street.\n\nIn January 1964 the band came fifth in a national beat group contest, with finals held at the Lyceum Strand on 4 May 1964. Highlights of the show were presented on BBC1 by [[Alan Freeman]]. Chris Wright left the line-up in late 1964 and was replaced by [[Ian Gillan]]. A female vocalist named Ann Cully joined the band soon after. Mick Tucker, from [[Ruislip]], joined on drums replacing Phil Kenton. The band recorded a number of tracks including a cover of the Coasters-[[the Hollies]]' hit \"Ain't That Just Like Me\", which was probably recorded at Jackson Sound Studios in [[Rickmansworth]]. The track includes Gillan on vocals, Tucker on drums and, according to band bassist Jan Frewer, is thought to have been recorded in 1965. Gillan quit in May 1965 to join [[Episode Six]], and later, [[Deep Purple]]. Cully remained on as vocalist before departing some time later. Gillan's and Cully's eventual replacement, in late 1966, was Scots-born vocalist Brian Connolly, who hailed more recently from [[Harefield]]. Tony Hall had joined on saxophone and vocals and when Fripp left he was replaced by Gordon Fairminer. Fairminer's position was eventually assumed by Frank Torpey - a schoolfriend of Tucker's who had just left West London group The Tribe (aka The Dream). Torpey only lasted a few months, and in late 1967 Robin Box took his place. Searle, regarded by many as the most talented musically, disappeared from the scene. Tucker and Connolly remained with Wainwright's Gentlemen until January 1968. Tucker was replaced by Roger Hills. When the Gentlemen eventually broke up, Hills and Box joined [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]] who eventually scored a big hit with \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\".\n\n===Early years===\nIn January 1968 Connolly and Tucker formed a new band calling themselves The Sweetshop. They recruited [[Bassist|bass guitarist]] and vocalist Steve Priest from a local band called The Army. Priest had previously played with mid-60's band the Countdowns who had been produced and recorded by Joe Meek. Frank Torpey was again recruited to play guitar. The quartet made its public debut at the Pavilion in [[Hemel Hempstead]] on 9 March 1968 and soon developed a following on the pub circuit, which led to a contract with [[Fontana Records]]. At the time, another UK band released a single under the same name Sweetshop, so the band abbreviated their moniker to The Sweet. The band was managed by [[Paul Nicholas]], who later went on to star in ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Nicholas worked with record producer [[Phil Wainman]] at Mellin Music Publishing and recommended the band to him. Their debut single \"Slow Motion\" (July 1968), produced by Wainman, and released on Fontana, failed to [[record chart|chart]] and owing to its rarity now sells for several hundred pounds when auctioned. Sweet were released from the [[recording contract]] and Frank Torpey left. In his autobiography ''Are You Ready Steve'', Priest said that Gordon Fairminer was approached to play for them when Torpey decided to leave Sweet after a gig at Playhouse Theatre [[Walton-on-Thames]] on 5 July 1969 but turned the job down as he wanted to concentrate on other interests.\n\n===New line-up and new record deal===\nGuitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with [[Errol Dixon]]. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with [[Johnny Kidd & The Pirates]].\n\nThe Sweet signed a new record contract with [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \"Lollipop Man\" (September 1969), \"All You'll Ever Get from Me\" (January 1970), and a [[cover version]] of [[the Archies]]' \"Get on the Line\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, [[Nicky Chinn]] and [[Mike Chapman]], who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \"Funny Funny\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with [[Mike McCartney]] (brother of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]) in [[the Scaffold]]. As a member of [[the Elastic Band]], he had played guitar on two singles for [[Decca Records|Decca]], \"Think of You Baby\" and \"Do Unto Others\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, ''Expansions on Life'', and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in [[Redcar]].\n\nThe Sweet initially attempted to combine diverse musical influences, including [[the Monkees]] and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of [[the Hollies]], with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the [[glam metal]] of a few years later.\n\nThe Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] as part of a compilation called ''[[Gimme Dat Ding (album)|Gimme Dat Ding]]'', released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; [[the Pipkins]] (whose sole hit, \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the [[A-side and B-side|A- and B-sides]] of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.\n\n===First album===\nThe Sweet made their UK television debut in December 1970 on a pop show called ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea|Lift Off]]'', performing the song \"Funny Funny\". A management deal was signed with the aforementioned songwriting team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. Phil Wainman resumed his collaboration with Sweet, as executive producer. This management deal also included a worldwide (the U.S. excepted) record contract with [[RCA Records]] (in the United States and Canada [[Bell Records]] issued the group's music until late 1973; followed by [[Capitol Records]]).\n\nIn March 1971 RCA issued \"Funny Funny\", written by Chinn and Chapman, which became the group's first international hit, climbing to the Top 20 on many of the world's charts. EMI reissued their 1970 single \"All You'll Ever Get from Me\" (May 1971) and it again failed to chart. Their next RCA release \"[[Co-Co (Sweet song)|Co-Co]]\" (June 1971) went to number two in the U.K. and their follow up single, \"Alexander Graham Bell\" (October 1971), only went to No. 33.<ref name=\"UK chart\">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/sweet/ Sweet UK chart history], The Official Charts Company. Retrieved 18 June 2012.</ref> These tracks still featured session musicians on the instruments with the quartet providing only the vocals.\n\nThe Sweet's first full LP album, ''[[Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be]]'', was released in November 1971. A collection of the band's recent singles supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including \"Chop Chop\" and \"Tom Tom Turnaround\") and pop covers (such as [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]'s \"[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]\" and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[Reflections (The Supremes song)|Reflections]]\"), the album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts. Their albums' failure to match the success of their singles was a problem that would plague the band throughout their career.\n\n===Initial success and rise to fame===\nFebruary 1972 saw the release of \"Poppa Joe\", which reached number 1 in Finland and peaked at number 11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> The next two singles of that year, \"[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]\" and \"[[Wig-Wam Bam]]\", both reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK,<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> and \"Little Willy\" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] after a re-issue in 1973, thus becoming the group's biggest American hit. Although \"Wig-Wam Bam\" remained largely true to the style of the Sweet's previous recordings, the vocals and guitars had a harder, more rock-oriented sound, largely because it was the first Chinn-Chapman single on which only members of Sweet played the instruments. In January 1973 \"[[Block Buster!]]\" became the Sweet's first single to reach number 1 on the UK chart, remaining there for five consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> After their next single \"Hell Raiser\" was released in May and reached number 2 in the U.K., the Sweet's U.S. label, Bell, released the group's first American album ''[[The Sweet (album)|The Sweet]]'' in July 1973.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/>\n\nTo promote their singles, the Sweet made numerous appearances on U.K. and European TV shows such as ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Supersonic (TV series)|Supersonic]]''. In one performance of \"Block Buster!\" on ''Top of the Pops'' Christmas edition, Priest aroused complaints after he appeared replete in a German military uniform, Hitler moustache and displaying a [[swastika]] armband.<ref>''[[Top of the Pops]]'', January 1973 - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgiDINcZ-q4 YouTube]</ref> The band also capitalised on the glam rock explosion, rivalling [[Gary Glitter]], [[T.Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Slade]], and [[Wizzard]] for outrageous stage clothing.\n\nDespite the Sweet's success, the relationship with their management was becoming increasingly tense. While they had developed a large fan-base among teenagers, the Sweet were not happy with their '[[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]]' image. The Sweet had always composed their own heavy-rock songs on the B-sides of their singles to contrast with the bubblegum A-sides which were composed by Chinn and Chapman. During this time, Sweet's live performances consisted of B-sides, album tracks, and various medleys of [[rock and roll]] classics; they avoided older 'novelty' hits like \"Funny Funny\" and \"Poppa Joe\". A 1973 performance at the Palace Theatre and Grand Hall in [[Kilmarnock]] ended in the Sweet being bottled off stage; the disorder was attributed by some (including Steve Priest) to the Sweet's lipstick and eye-shadow look, and by others to the audience being unfamiliar with the concert set (the 1999 CD release ''[[Live at the Rainbow 1973]]'' documents a live show from this period). The incident would be immortalised in the hit \"[[The Ballroom Blitz]]\" (September 1973). In the meantime, the Sweet's chart success continued, showing particular strength in the UK, [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and Australia. At the end of 1973, the band's name evolved from \"The Sweet\" to \"Sweet\". The change would be reflected in all of their releases from 1974 onward.\n\n===Forming a new image===\nBy 1974, Sweet had grown tired of the management team of Chinn and Chapman, who wrote the group's major hits and cultivated the band's glam rock image. The group and producer Phil Wainman, assisted by engineer Peter Coleman, recorded the album ''[[Sweet Fanny Adams (album)|Sweet Fanny Adams]]'', which was released in April 1974. Sweet's technical proficiency was demonstrated for the first time on self-penned hard rock tracks such as \"Sweet F.A.\" and \"Set Me Free\". Sweet also adopted a more conventional [[hard rock]] sound and appearance. ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' also featured compressed high-pitched backing vocal [[harmony|harmonies]], which was a trend that continued on all of Sweet's albums.\n\nDuring sessions for the album, Brian Connolly was injured in a fight in [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]] High Street. His throat was badly injured and his ability to sing severely limited. Priest and Scott filled in on lead vocals on some tracks (\"No You Don't\", \"Into The Night\" and \"Restless\") and Connolly, under treatment from a [[Harley Street]] specialist, managed to complete the album. The band did not publicise the incident and told the press that subsequent cancelled shows were due to Connolly having a throat infection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesweetweb.com/8-giglists/15-gigs1974 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930115708/http://www.thesweetweb.com/8-giglists/15-gigs1974 |archive-date=30 September 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This incident reportedly permanently compromised Connolly's singing ability, with his range diminished.\n\nNo previous singles appeared on the album, and none were released, except in [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], where \"[[Peppermint Twist]]/Rebel Rouser\", apparently released by their record company without their knowledge, gained a No. 1 chart position in the latter. ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' would be Sweet's only non-compilation release to break the [[UK Albums Chart]] Top 40.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/>\n\nSweet were invited by [[Pete Townshend]] to support [[the Who]], who were playing at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s football ground, [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] in June 1974. However, Connolly's badly bruised throat kept them from fulfilling the role. Sweet had frequently cited the Who as being one of their main influences and played a medley of their tracks in their live set for many years.\n\n===''Desolation Boulevard''===\nTheir third album, ''[[Desolation Boulevard]]'', was released later in 1974, six months after ''Sweet Fanny Adams''. By that stage, producer Phil Wainman had moved on and the album was produced by Mike Chapman. It was recorded in a mere six days and featured a rawer \"live\" sound. One track, \"[[(Themes from) The Man with the Golden Arm|The Man with the Golden Arm]]\", written by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and [[Sylvia Fine]] for the 1955 [[Frank Sinatra]] movie of the same name, featured drummer Mick Tucker performing an 8 and half minute solo (although this was not included in the U.S. release). This had been a staple of the band's live performance for years. The first single from the LP, the heavy-melodic \"The Six Teens\" (July 1974), was a Top 10 hit in the U.K.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> and still part of the amazing unbroken string of No. 1's in Denmark. However, the subsequent single release, \"Turn It Down\" (November 1974), reached only No. 41 on the U.K. chart and No. 2 in Denmark.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/> \"Turn It Down\" received minimal [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] on UK radio and was banned by some radio stations because of certain [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content - \"God-awful sound\" and \"For God sakes, turn it down\" - which were deemed \"unsuitable for family listening.\" The band resumed playing live shows nearly a full six months after Connolly's throat injury, with band and critics noting a rougher edge to his voice and a reduced range. The album also featured a group composition, \"Fox On The Run\", which was to be re-recorded months later.\n\nThe U.S. version of ''Desolation Boulevard'' was different from the U.K. version and included several songs from ''Sweet Fanny Adams'' in addition to the \"Ballroom Blitz\" and \"Fox on the Run\" singles (both of which peaked at No. 5 in the US). Side One of the album contained all Chapman-Chinn penned songs, while Side Two featured songs written and produced by Sweet.\n\n===Writing and producing their own material===\nIn 1975 Sweet went back into the studio to re-arrange and record a more pop-oriented version of the track \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\". Sweet's first self-written and produced single, \"Fox on the Run\" was released worldwide in March 1975 and became their biggest selling hit, reaching number one in Germany, Denmark, and [[South Africa]], number two in the United Kingdom, [[Ireland]], [[Norway]] and the [[Netherlands]] and number three in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. In Australia it not only made it to the top of the charts, it also became the biggest selling single of that year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Mark|title=Australian Singles Chart For 1975|url=http://www.australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1975/|publisher=Australian Music History|accessdate=29 November 2010|date=5 September 2007}}</ref> The song reached number two in Canada and number five in the U.S. The release of this track marked the end of the formal Chinn-Chapman working relationship and the band stressed it was now fully self-sufficient as writers and producers.\n\nThe following single release, \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" (July 1975), peaked at number 15 in the UK. Now confident in their own songwriting and production abilities, Sweet spent the latter half of 1975 in [[Musicland Studios]] in [[Munich]], Germany, where they recorded the ''[[Give Us A Wink]]'' album with German [[audio engineer|sound engineer]] [[Reinhold Mack]], who later recorded with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and co-produced [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. The new album release was deferred until 1976 so as not to stifle the chart success ''Desolation Boulevard'' was enjoying, peaking at number 25 in the US and number 5 in Canada.\n\nWith ''Give Us a Wink'' being held over, RCA issued a [[double album]] in Europe, ''[[Strung Up (Sweet album)|Strung Up]]'', in November. It contained one live disc, recorded in London in December 1973, and one disc compiling previously released single tracks (plus an unused track by Chinn and Chapman \u2013 \"I Wanna Be Committed\"). At the end of the year, Andy Scott released his first solo single, \"Lady Starlight\" b/w \"Where D'Ya Go\". Tucker played drums on both tracks.\n\n===Decline in popularity===\nJanuary 1976 saw the release of the single \"The Lies In Your Eyes\", which made the Top 10 in Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia, but only reached No.&nbsp;35 on the U.K. charts. Sweet's first album to be fully produced and written by themselves, ''[[Give Us A Wink]]'', was released in March 1976. A third single from the album, \"4th&nbsp;Of&nbsp;July\", was issued in Australia.\n\nBy this time, Sweet strove to build on their growing popularity in America with a schedule of more than fifty headline concert dates. Even though ''Give Us A Wink''{{'}}s release was imminent, the band's set essentially promoted the US version of ''Desolation Boulevard'' plus the new US hit single \"Action\". During an appearance at [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in California on 24 March, Sweet played \"[[All Right Now]]\" with [[Ritchie Blackmore]] as a tribute to mark the death of [[Free (band)|Free]] guitarist [[Paul Kossoff]], who was to have supported Sweet with his band [[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]]. The US tour was not financially successful, with small audiences at many venues leading to the final half-dozen or so dates to be cancelled. Following the end of the  tour, the band went on to [[Scandinavia]] and Germany. The band also spent a week at [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] in [[Battersea]] demoing material for a new album before abandoning that project and playing eight dates in Japan. By the end of the Japanese shows Connolly's extremely hoarse singing voice was manifest evidence of the demands of constant touring and the enduring after-effects of his 1974 assault.\n\nBetween October 1976 and January 1977, Sweet wrote and recorded new material at Kingsway Recorders and Audio International London studios for their next album. An advance single from the album, \"Lost Angels\", was only a hit in Germany,<ref name=\"German chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Sweet/24734/single |title=Chartverfolgung / Sweet / Single |work=Music Line |publisher=[[Media Control Charts]] |location=[[Germany]] |language=German |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> Austria and Sweden. A new album, ''[[Off the Record (Sweet album)|Off the Record]]'', was released in April. The next single from the album, \"Fever of Love\", represented the band heading in a somewhat more Europop hard rock direction, once again charting in Germany,<ref name=\"German chart\"/> Austria and Sweden, while reaching number 10 in South Africa. On this album, Sweet again worked with ''Give Us A Wink'' engineer Louis Austin, who would later engineer [[Def Leppard]]'s ''[[On Through The Night]]'' 1980 d\u00e9but album. The band cancelled a US tour with emerging US rockers [[Aerosmith]], did not play any live dates in support of the album and, in fact, did not play a single concert for the whole of 1977.\n\n===''Level Headed'' and a change in style===\nSweet left RCA in 1977 and signed a new deal with [[Polydor]] though it would not come into force until later in the year. Sweet's manager David Walker, from Handle Artists, negotiated the move which was reputed to be worth around \u00a3750,000. In the United States, Canada and Japan Capitol had issued Sweet's albums since 1974 and would continue to do so through 1980.\n\nThe first Polydor album, ''[[Level Headed]]'' (January 1978), found Sweet experimenting by combining rock and classical sounds \"''a-la clavesin''\", an approach similar to [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s, and featured the single \"Love Is Like Oxygen\". Largely recorded during 1977 at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] near [[Paris, France]] after a 30 day writing session at [[Clearwell Castle]] in the [[Forest of Dean|Forest Of Dean]] UK, the album represented a new musical direction, largely abandoning hard-rock for a more melodic pop style, interspersed with ballads accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra. The ballad, \"Lettres D'Amour\", featured a duet between Connolly and [[Stevie Lange]] (who would emerge as lead singer with the group [[Night (rock band)|Night]] in 1979).\n\nWith the addition of session and touring musicians keyboardist Gary Moberley and guitarist Nico Ramsden, Sweet undertook a short European and Scandinavian tour followed by a single British concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 24 February 1978. However, \"[[Love Is Like Oxygen]]\" (January 1978) was their last U.K., U.S., and German Top 10 hit.<ref name=\"UK chart\"/><ref name=\"German chart\"/> Scott was nominated for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for co-composing the song. One more single from the album, \"California Nights\" (May 1978), featuring Steve Priest as the lead vocalist, peaked at number 23 on the German charts.\n\n===Departure of Brian Connolly===\nBetween March and May 1978 Sweet extensively toured the US, as a support act for [[Bob Seger]] and the Silver Bullet Band. The tour included a disastrous date in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on 3 May, during which visiting Capitol Records executives in the audience saw Brian Connolly give a drunken and incoherent performance that terminated early in the set with his collapse on stage, leaving the rest of the group to play on without him. The band returned briefly to Britain before resuming the second leg of their US tour in late May supporting other acts, including [[Foghat]] and [[Alice Cooper]]. Concluding the US tour in early July 1978, Brian's alcoholism and estrangement from the group was steadily becoming a greater issue.\n\nIn late October, having spent further time at Clearwell Castle to write for their next album, Sweet arrived at The Town House studio in [[Shepherds Bush]], London to complete and record, ''[[Cut Above the Rest]]'' (April 1979). Due to tensions between various members attributed to Connolly's health and diminishing status with the group, his long-time friend and fellow founding member, Mick Tucker, was tasked to produce Connolly's vocals. It was felt Tucker would extract a better performance than Scott from Connolly. A number of tracks were recorded featuring Connolly. However, these efforts were deemed unsatisfactory and Brian left the band on 2 November 1978.\n\nOn 23 February 1979, Brian Connolly's departure from Sweet was formally announced by manager David Walker. Publicly, Connolly was said to be pursuing a solo career with an interest in recording [[country rock]].\n\n===Three piece Sweet===\nSweet continued as a trio with Priest assuming the lion's share of lead vocals, though Scott and Tucker were also active in that role. The first single release for the trio was \"Call Me\". Guest [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] player Gary Moberley continued to augment the group on stage. Guitarist Ray McRiner joined their touring line-up in 1979, with a small tour with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] in the eastern United States and [[Cheap Trick]] in Texas in the spring and summer of '79 to support ''Cut Above The Rest'' (which was released in April 1979). McRiner would also contribute the songs \"Too Much Talking\" and the single \"Give The Lady Some Respect\" to the next Sweet album, ''[[Waters Edge]]'' (August 1980), which was recorded in Canada. In the US, ''Waters Edge'' was titled ''Sweet VI''. It featured the singles \"Sixties Man\" and \"Give The Lady Some Respect\". Tragedy befell Mick Tucker when his wife Pauline drowned in the bath at their home on 26 December 1979. The band withdrew from live work for all of 1980.\n\nOne more studio album, ''[[Identity Crisis (Sweet album)|Identity Crisis]]'', was recorded during 1980\u201381 but was only released in West Germany and Mexico. Sweet undertook a short tour of the UK and performed their last live show at [[Glasgow]] University on 20 March 1981. Steve Priest then returned to the United States, where he had been living since late 1979. When Polydor released ''Identity Crisis'' in October 1982, the original Sweet had been disbanded for almost a year.\n\n==Re-formed versions (1984\u2013present)==\n===Andy Scott's Sweet (1985\u2013present)===\nAndy Scott and Mick Tucker organised their own version of Sweet with [[Paul Mario Day]] (ex-[[Iron Maiden]], [[More (band)|More]], Wildfire) on lead vocals, [[Phil Lanzon]] (ex-Grand Prix) on keyboards and [[Mal McNulty]] on bass. The band performed at the [[Marquee Club]] in London in February 1986, with the shows recorded and gaining release a few years later, bolstered by four new studio tracks including a cover of the [[Motown]] standard \"[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]\". This line-up also toured Australian and New Zealand pubs and clubs for more than three months in 1985 and for a similar period again in 1986. Singer Paul Mario Day ended up marrying the band's Australian tour guide and relocating downunder. He continued with Sweet commuting back and forth to Europe for the group's tours until this proved to be too cumbersome. He departed in late 1988. As McNulty moved into the front man spot, Jeff Brown came in to take over bass early in 1989. Lanzon too went back and forth between Sweet and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] during 1986-1988 before Heep's schedule grew too busy. Malcolm Pearson and then Ian Gibbons (who had played with [[The Kinks]] and [[The Records]]) both filled in for Lanzon until Steve Mann (Liar, [[Lionheart (UK band)|Lionheart]], [[McAuley Schenker Group]]) arrived in December 1989.\n\nTucker departed after a show in [[Lochau]], [[Austria]], on 5 May 1991. He later was diagnosed with a rare form of [[leukaemia]]. Three drummers, Andy Hoyler, Bobby Andersen and Bruce Bisland (Weapon, Wildfire, [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]]), provided short-term relief before Bodo Schopf ([[McAuley Schenker Group]]) took over. They recorded an album during this period, simply titled ''A''. Before the band embarked on the supporting tour for ''A''  in 1992, Bodo left and Bisland returned as permanent percussionist. Scott changed the band's name to 'Andy Scott's Sweet' after Tucker's departure but truncated it to simply 'The Sweet' once again after Tucker's death in 2002.\n\n[[Mal McNulty]], now lead vocalist, departed in 1994, though he would return briefly that year to fill in for Jeff Brown on bass (as he would again in 1995 as lead singer for a few dates while Rocky Newton subbed on bass). Sweet's former keyboard men Gary Moberley and Ian Gibbons also did fill-in jaunts with the group that year, as did Chris Goulstone. Chad Brown (ex-[[Lionheart (UK band)|Lionheart]]; no relation to Jeff) was the new front man. ''Glitz Blitz and Hitz'', a new studio album of re-recorded Sweet hits, was released during this period.\n\nIn 1996 Mann left to take a job in television and Gibbons came back for a short time before Steve Grant (ex-[[The Animals]]) became the permanent keyboardist. When Chad Brown quit in 1998 after developing a throat infection, Jeff Brown assumed lead vocals and bass duties. After this, the band was stable again for the next five years.\n\nThe mid-2000s would bring further confusing shake-ups and rotations. Tony O'Hora (ex-[[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]], [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]]) replaced Brown as lead vocalist in 2003. [[Ian Gibbons (musician)|Ian Gibbons]] came back for a third stint as fill-in keyboardist in June 2005 for a gig in the [[Faroe Islands]]. O'Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while [[Jo Burt]] (ex-[[Black Sabbath]]) was temporary bass player. [[Tony Mills (musician)|Tony Mills]] (ex-[[Shy (band)|Shy]]) was slated to be Sweet's new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, O'Hora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-[[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]) arrived in July 2006. The line-up then consisted of Scott, Bisland, Grant and Lincoln.\n\nScott produced the [[Suzi Quatro]] album ''[[Back to the Drive]]'', released in February 2006. March 2006 saw the U.S. release of his band's album ''Sweetlife''.\n\nIn 2007 the group played in Germany, Belgium, Austria and Italy. In May of that year, the band played in [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], their first and only South American shows. The tour was called the 'Sweet Fanny Adams Tour'.\n\nThe band toured again in March 2008 under the name 'Sweet Fanny Adams Revisited Tour'. In May and June, Scott's Sweet were part of the \"Glitz Blitz & 70s Hitz\" tour of the UK alongside [[The Rubettes]] and [[Showaddywaddy]].\n\nIn March and April 2010, Scott was absent from a couple of gigs due to ill health and Martin Mickels stood in. Scott revealed later that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and was treated at the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]]. After a course of treatment and rest, he was back to full touring fitness. In 2010 the band played at venues in Europe and back at [[Bilston]] in October.\n\nIn March 2011 there was a short tour of Australia, Regal Theatre - Perth,  and Clipsal 500, Adelaide with the [[Doobie Brothers]]. Also in 2011, Tony O'Hora came back to the group, this time as keyboardist, after Grant departed.\n\nIn March 2012 the band released a new album ''New York Connection''. Recorded in England, it comprised 11 cover versions, including the 2011 single \"Join Together\" and one revamped original recording; the 1972 B-side \"New York Connection\". All the covers either featured 'bits and pieces' of Sweet hits or other artist songs, such as a \"new version of the [[Ramones]] ''[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]'' [which] shared space with samples from \u2018Ballroom Blitz,\u2019 and a take on [[Hello (band)|Hello]]\u2019s ''[[New York Groove]]'' (made famous in the US by [[Ace Frehley]]) featured a sample from [[Jay-Z]]\u2019s ''[[Empire State Of Mind]]'' along with other Sweet references.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/sweet-return-with-new-album-new-york-connection/?trackback=tsmclip |title=Sweet Return With New Album \u2018New York Connection\u2019 |author=Dave Swanson |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the eve of their March 2012 \"Join Together\" tour of Australia, the band undertook an acoustic performance of three tracks, \"New York Groove-Empire State of Mind\", \"Blockbuster\" and \"Peppermint Twist\", in front of a live audience at ABC Radio Studios in East Perth. Shows in [[Perth]], [[Adelaide]], [[Hobart]], [[Geelong]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] featured tracks from the new album for the first time.\n\n[[Paul Manzi]] joined Sweet on their 2014 Australian tour, replacing Tony O'Hora who was absent for personal reasons. Manzi played guitar, keyboard and undertook lead vocals on \"Set Me Free\" and \"AC-DC\" as the band performed shows in regional centres, including outback Western Australia, Darwin and far-north [[Queensland]], [[NSW]] and Victoria during February and March. The band, with O'Hora back in the ranks, returned to Australia in September 2014 as the headlining act for \"Rock The Boat 4\". This was a cruise aboard the ship [[Rhapsody of the Seas]] which departed Sydney and took in [[New Caledonia]] and [[Vanuatu]]. The band played two gigs and various members guested with Australian veteran performers including [[Brian Cadd]] and [[Russell Morris]] and members of [[AC/DC]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Rose Tattoo]] and [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]].\n\nIn June 2015 it was revealed that the band were going on an extensive tour of the UK in late 2015 and that this tour would probably be their last.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.teamrock.com/news/2015-06-03/the-sweet-announce-final-tour |title=The Sweet announce final tour |website=TeamRock.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2015 summer tour dates, Paul Manzi returned to sub for Peter Lincoln who left this online message to the fans: \"There have been a few rumours going around this weekend, so . . . just to say that I am alive and well! The short explanation for my absence is that I need to rest my voice for a few weeks. We are lucky that our good friend Paul Manzi is able to step in, and Tony knows the role of bass player/singer, so the shows can go ahead, and they will be great! I look forward to being back on stage very soon.\"\n\nPete Lincoln duly resumed his role in the band and they continued with extensive live dates, known as the \"Finale\" tour in Germany. \n\nIn 2017 after Andy undertook a successful Australian visit with Suzi Quatro and Don Powell in the side outfit known as QSP, Sweet was again booked for an extensive European tour.\n\n===New Sweet, Brian Connolly's Sweet (1984\u20131997)===\nIn 1984 Brian Connolly formed a new version of the Sweet without any of the other original members. Despite recurring ill health, Connolly toured the UK and Europe with his band, \"Brian Connolly's Sweet\", which was then renamed to \"New Sweet\". His most successful concerts were in West Germany, before and after reunification.\n\nDuring 1987, Connolly met up again with Frank Torpey. Torpey later explained in interviews Connolly was trying to get a German recording deal. The two got on very well and Torpey subsequently invited Connolly to go into the recording studio with him, as an informal project. After much trepidation, Connolly turned up and the track \"Sharontina\" was recorded. This recording would not be released until 1998, appearing on Frank Torpey's album ''Sweeter''.\n\nBy July 1990, plans were made for Connolly and his band to tour Australia in November. During the long flight to Australia, Connolly's health had suffered and he was hospitalised in Adelaide Hospital, allegedly for dehydration and related problems. The rest of the band played a show in Adelaide without him. After being released from the hospital, Connolly joined the other band members in Melbourne for a gig at the Pier Hotel, in Frankston. After several other shows, including one at the Dingley Powerhouse, Connolly and his band played a final date at Melbourne's Greek Theatre. It was felt Connolly's health was sufficient reason for the tour not to be extended, and some of the planned dates were abandoned. Connolly went back to England and his band appeared on The [[Mark Trevorrow|Bob Downe]] Christmas show on 18 December 1990.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Connolly played the European \"oldies\" circuit and occasional outdoor festivals in Europe with his band. On 22 March 1992, a heavy duty tape recorder was stolen from the band's van whilst at a gig in the [[Bristol Hippodrome]] with [[Mud (band)|Mud]]. It contained demos of four new songs, totalling about 20 mixes.\n\nLegal problems were going on in the background over the use of the Sweet name between Connolly and Andy Scott. Both parties agreed to distinguish their group's names to help promoters and fans. The New Sweet went back to being called Brian Connolly's Sweet and Andy Scott's version became Andy Scott's Sweet.\n\nIn 1994, Connolly and his band played in Dubai. He appeared at the Galleria Theatre, [[Hyatt]] Regency. He also performed in Bahrain.\n\nBy this time Connolly had healed the differences with Steve Priest and Mick Tucker, and was invited to the wedding of Priest's eldest daughter, Lisa. At the private function, for which Priest specially flew back to England, Priest and Connolly performed together.\n\nIn 1995, Connolly released a new album entitled ''Let's Go''. His partner Jean, whom he had met a few years earlier, gave birth to a son. Connolly also performed in Switzerland that year.\n\nOn 2 November 1996 British TV Network [[Channel 4]] aired a programme ''Don't Leave Me This Way'', which examined Connolly's time as a pop star with the Sweet, the subsequent decline in the band's popularity, and its impact on Connolly and the other band members. The show revealed Connolly's ill health but also that he was continuing with his concert dates at [[Butlins]]. Connolly and his band had appeared at Butlins a number of times on tour during the early 1990s.\n\nConnolly's final concert was at the Bristol Hippodrome on 5 December 1996, with Slade II and John Rossall's Glitter Band Experience.\n\n===Steve Priest's Sweet (2008\u2013present)===\n<!--This section was initially written on the page [[Steve Priest]]. For earlier editions and credited contributors, see the history on that page.-->\nIn January 2008 Steve Priest assembled his own version of the Sweet in Los Angeles. He enlisted a guitarist [[Stuart Smith (musician)|Stuart Smith]] and L.A. native Richie Onori, Smith's bandmate in Heaven & Earth, was brought in on drums. The keyboard spot was manned by ex-Crow and [[World Classic Rockers]] alumni Stevie Stewart. Front-man and vocalist Joe Retta was brought in to round out the line-up.\n\nAfter an initial appearance on L.A. rock station 95.5 KLOS's popular Mark & Brian radio program, the \"Are You Ready Steve?\" tour kicked off at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood on 12 June 2008. The band spent the next several months playing festivals and gigs throughout the U.S. and Canada, including [[Moondance Jam]] in [[Walker, Minnesota]]; headlining at the [[Rock N Resort Music Festival]] in [[North Lawrence, Ohio]] (near Canal Fulton); [[London, Ontario]]'s [[Rock the Park]]; another headlining gig at Peterborough's Festival of Lights; the Common Ground Festival in [[Lansing, Michigan]]; and a benefit concert for victims of California's wildfires at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn January 2009 the Sweet presented at the concert industry's [[Pollstar]] Awards, and also played a short set at the Nokia Theatre where the event was held, marking the first time in the ceremony's history that a band performed at the show. In addition to local gigs at the [[House of Blues]] on L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]] and [[Universal CityWalk]], 2009 saw the band return to Canada for sold-out shows at the Mae Wilson Theater and [[Casino Regina]], as well as the [[Nakusp Music Fest]] and [[Rockin' the Fields of Minnedosa]] in [[Minnedosa, Manitoba]]. U.S. festivals have included Minnesota's [[Halfway Jam]], Rockin' the Rivers in Montana (with [[Pat Travers]] and [[Peter Frampton]]), and two late-summer shows at the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]].\n\nThe new band recorded a cover version of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Ticket to Ride]]\", which was included on Cleopatra Records' ''Abbey Road'', a Fab Four tribute CD that was released on 24 March 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = Abbey Road | publisher = Cleopatra Records | url = http://www.cleorecs.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=4820&category=0 | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090928060127/http://www.cleorecs.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=4820&category=0 | archivedate = 28 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA preview of the band's new CD ''Live in America'', which was recorded live at the [[Morongo Casino, Resort & Spa]] in [[Cabazon, California]] on 30 August 2008, was featured on KLOS's \"Front Row\" program on 12 April 2009.

As of February 2011, fans who purchased pre-sale tickets were still in the process of working through the administrative channels with [[PayPal]] and various banks and credit card issuers in order to try to reclaim their funds.\n\nThe band toured [[South America]] along with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] during March 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.requiemweb.com.ar/destacado.php?id=295 |title=Revista Requiem |website=Requiemweb.com.ar |accessdate=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512030534/http://www.requiemweb.com.ar/destacado.php?id=295 |archivedate=12 May 2013  }}</ref>\n\nThe band and their European fans then also got re-united quicker than thought, when the band got booked by a befriended female Belgian promoter. Two east German gigs, 27 and 28 May 2011, so in Borna and in Schwarzenberg Steve Priest's Sweet hit the European grounds. After more than 30 years, Steve Priest got a warm welcome back in Europe.\n\nAs of 12 August 2012, Stuart Smith resigned from the guitar post in order to dedicate more time to his \"Heaven & Earth\" project.\n\nBeginning with the band's October 2012 appearance at the Festival Internacional Chihuahua in Mexico, Los Angeles-based guitarist Ricky Z. teamed up with Steve Priest and company for their live performances. In February 2013, this lineup returned to Casino Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. Tour dates played in summer 2013 included Riverfest in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]], the St. Clair, MI Riverfest, several additional dates in Canada, and a reprise of their appearances at both Moondance Jam in Walker, MN and Rockin' the Rivers in [[Three Forks, Montana]]. The band made some rare appearances on the U.S. east coast in July 2013, including a performance with [[David Johansen]] of the [[New York Dolls]] at the [[Bergen Performing Arts Center]] in [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. Singer Joe Retta was unavailable for these dates due to a scheduling conflict, so Tribe of Gypsies frontman Chas West, who has played with [[Jason Bonham]]'s band and has experience subbing in such well-known bands as [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Lynch Mob]] and [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]], stepped in to man the microphone for a series of shows in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.\n\nOn 27 August 2014, Steve Priest announced on the band's Facebook page that guitarist Mitch Perry had been tapped for the guitar slot. Most recently on tour with [[Lita Ford]], Mitch's other credentials included his work with [[Michael Schenker Group]], [[Asia Featuring John Payne]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Billy Sheehan]] and [[David Lee Roth]] His first live appearance with Sweet was at the Rock the River festival in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] on 23 August 2014.\n\n22 December 2017 saw the launch of the 50th anniversary tour at the Whisky a Go Go on L.A.'s Sunset Strip and the introduction of new singer Paul Zablidowski AKA \"Paulie Z\" former lead singer and guitarist of ZO2, children's band \"The Z Brothers\" and star of IFC show Z-Rock.

As he remembers: \"I met them at the airport and Andy and Mick came off the plane. I said, 'Where's Brian?' They said, 'Oh, he's coming.' All the people had come off the plane by now. Then this little old man hobbled towards us. He was shaking, and had a ghostly white face. I thought, 'Oh, Jesus Christ.' It was horrifying.\" Reworked studio versions of \"Action\" and \"The Ballroom Blitz\" were recorded, but it became clear that Connolly's voice and physical health had made Sweet's original member comeback too difficult to promote commercially. Consequently, the reunion attempt was aborted.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/23/sweet-strange-history |title=Glam rock bottom: why did it go so sour for Sweet? |author=David Cavanagh |date=23 September 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 this line-up was again reunited for the promotion of a music documentary entitled ''Sweet's Ballroom Blitz''. This UK video release, which contained UK television performances from the 1970s and current-day interviews, was released at Tower Records, London. Sweet was interviewed by Power Hour, Super Channel, and spoke of a possible reunion.\n\nBrian Connolly died at the age of 51 on 9 February 1997 from liver failure and repeated heart attacks, attributed to his abuse of alcohol in the 1970s and early 1980s. Mick Tucker subsequently died on 14 February 2002 from leukemia, at the age of 54.\n\n==Later years==\nToday, two versions of The Sweet are still active with original members: \"Andy Scott's Sweet\", who frequently tour across Europe as Sweet and makes occasional sojourns to other markets including regular visits to Australia and \"Steve Priest's Sweet\" who tour the US and Canada.\n\nOn 28 April 2009, [[Shout!

The company bought XTRA [[XTRA (AM)|AM]]/[[XTRA-FM|FM]], and the AM station became the first all-sports talk show in the US. The FM station did not do too well with its album-oriented [[rock music|rock]] programming, so Lynch switched to [[alternative rock]] instead and created [[91X]]. Upon Noble's death in 1985, Lynch took over the company and over the following decade expanded into 20 stations throughout the nation.<ref name=laing/> In 1996 he sold the company to [[Jacor Communications]] for $152 million, which was bought by [[Clear Channel Communications]] soon after.<ref name=laing/> Over the next five years, a noncompete agreement barred Lynch from the radio industry, so during that time he presided over the San Diego International Sports Council and helped bring the [[2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship]] to San Diego.<ref name=donoho/>\n\nIn 2003, Lynch learned from his daughter Kara Guthrie, who headed sports sales for Clear Channel, that her company decided to move XTRA Sports to [[Los Angeles]]. As XTRA Sports was the only local sports talk show in San Diego, the void and laid-off staff essentially gave Lynch a \"ready-made radio station\" to pick up.<ref name=laing/> He and a partner from Noble established the [[Broadcast Company of the Americas]] and started [[Mighty 1090]].<ref name=laing/>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lynch, John}}\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Chicago]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from San Diego]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Wcquidditch", "label": "safe", "comment": "KFMB-FM has changed its call sign to KFBG, but for archival purposes the link will continue to say KFMB-FM", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(radio)"}
