The tea is known as Dharamsala or [[Kangra tea]], is very popular across India and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangra-s-cup-of-tea-is-losing-its-aroma/story-JmvDHitd4ehHaPyIPHb66H.html |title=Kangra's cup of tea is losing its aroma|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=8 October 2017|accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref> Traditionally known for Kangra green tea, Dharamshala now produces all teas including black tea, green tea, oolong tea and white teas, in addition to the popular Kashmiri Kahwa and Masala Chai.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Dharamshala'' ([[Devanagari]]: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e; [[ITRANS]]: Dharmashala; [[IAST]]: Dharma\u015b\u0101l\u0101) is a [[Hindi]] word (derived from [[Sanskrit]]) that is a compound of ''[[dharma]]'' (\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e) and ''sh\u0101l\u0101'' (\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e). A loose translation into English would be 'spiritual dwelling' or, more loosely, 'sanctuary'.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Rendering a precise literal translation into English is problematic due to the vast and conceptually rich [[semantic field]] of the word ''[[Dharma#Etymology|dharma]]'' and the cultural aspect of India.\n\nIn common Hindi usage, the word ''dharamshala'' refers to a shelter or rest house for spiritual pilgrims. Traditionally, such ''dharamshalas'' (pilgrims' rest houses) were commonly constructed near pilgrimage destinations (often in remote areas) to give visitors a place to sleep for the night. When the first permanent settlement was created in the place now called Dharamshala, there was one such pilgrims' rest house on the site, and the settlement took its name from that ''Dharamshala''.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_307.gif |title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India |chapter=Dharmsala |volume=XI |pages=301\u2013302 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1908 |via=Digital South Asia Library}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Before the British Raj===\nUntil the [[British Raj]], Dharamshala and its surrounding area was ruled by the [[Katoch]] Dynasty of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]], a royal family that ruled the region for two millennia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091104/himplus.htm#8|title=Seminar on Katoch dynasty trail|date=4 November 2009 |publisher=Tribune India|quote=new findings by researchers suggest \"the Katoch dynasty dates back to 8,000 years and its 300 rulers ruled in the pre-Mahabharata period and the present scion of this clan, Aditya Dev Katoch, is the 488th member of the clan in the lineage\"  The researchers claimed \"this dynasty is not only the oldest ruling clan of India but also the oldest dynasty of the world and its founder, Adipursha, had come from Mongolia about 11,000 years back\".}}</ref> The royal family still keeps a residence in Dharamsala, known as 'Clouds End Villa'. Under the British Raj, the regions were part of [[Punjab Province (British India)|undivided province of Punjab]], and was ruled by the [[List of governors of Punjab (British India)|governors of Punjab]] from Lahore. The Katoch dynasty, although highly regarded culturally, had been reduced to status of [[jagirdar]]s (of [[Kangra-Lambagraon]]) under the Treaty of Jawalamukhi, signed in 1810 between Sansar Chand Katoch and Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sikh Empire]]. The indigenous people of the Dharamshala area (and the surrounding region) are the [[Gaddis]], a predominantly [[Hindu]] group who traditionally lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic [[transhumance|transhumant]] lifestyle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Due to the lack of permanent settlements in the area, some Gaddis lost their seasonal pastures and farmland when the British and the [[Gurkhas]] arrived to settle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Settlement by the British and the Gurkhas===\n[[File:Lord Eligin's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint John's Church in The Wilderness at Dharamsala, built in 1852]]\n[[File:Lord Elgin's Tomb, Dharamshala.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]] at [[St. John in the Wilderness Church (Dharamshala)|St. John in the Wilderness Church]]]]\nIn 1848, the area now known as Dharamshala was annexed by the British.\n\n:\"Dharams\u0101la lies on a spur of the Dhola Dh\u0101r, 16 miles north-east of K\u0101ngra, in the midst of wild and picturesque scenery. It originally formed a subsidiary cantonment for the troops stationed at K\u0101ngra, and was first occupied as a station in 1849, when a site was required for a cantonment to accommodate a Native regiment which was being raised in the District. A site was found upon the slopes of the Dhola Dh\u0101r, in a plot of waste land, upon which stood an old Hindu resthouse, or ''dharms\u0101la'', whence the name adopted for the new cantonment. The civil authorities, following the example of the regimental officers, and attracted by the advantages of climate and scenery, built themselves houses in the neighbourhood of the cantonment; and in 1855 the new station was formally recognised as the headquarters of the [K\u0101ngra] District.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1860, the 66th [[Gurkha]] [[Light Infantry]] was moved from [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh]] to Dharamshala, which was at first made a subsidiary [[cantonment]].

Consequently, fourteen Gurkha platoon villages grew from this settlement, and exist to this day, namely Dari, Ramnagar, Shyamnagar, Dal, Totarani, Khanyara, Sadher, Chaandmaari, Sallagarhi, [[Sidhbari]], [[Yol, India|Yol]], and so on. The Gurkhas worshipped at the ancient [[Shiva]] temple of Bhagsunag. The Gurkhas referred to Dharamshala as 'Bhagsu' and referred to themselves as Bhagsuwalas.\n\nThe 21st Gurkha Regiment from Dharamshala performed heroic feats during [[World War I]] and the North West Frontier Province campaigns. The Gurkha cantonment then reached its zenith during [[World War II]], when battalions from Dharamshala made history. Many place names in the town still retain their former cantonment terminologies: Depot Bazaar, Pensioners' Lines, Tirah Lines (named after the 19th century [[Tirah Campaign]]), Bharatpore Lines (named after the 1826 Battle of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpore]]).\n\nThe second [[Lord Elgin]], [[Viceroy]] of India died here (at the 1st Gurkha Rifles Officers' Mess) in 1863 and is buried in the cemetery of [[St. John in the Wilderness Church (Dharamshala)|St. John in the Wilderness]], a small [[Anglican]] church distinguished by its [[stained-glass]] windows. Dharamshala became a popular [[hill station]] for the British working in or near [[Delhi]], offering a cool respite during the hot summer months.\n\n:\"Before the earthquake of 1905, the upper part of the station, which rises to a height of 7,112 feet [2,168 metres], contained the European houses, the station church, and the officers' mess and lines of the 1st Gurkhas, together with the public gardens, post office, and two bazars, the Forsythganj and McLeodganj. The public offices, a bazar, and a few European houses made up the lower station, as low as 4,500 feet [1,372 metres]. The 1st battalion of the 1st Gurkhas used to be stationed here, but was moved to the upper station in 1894-5.... The public gardens, which were, before the earthquake, laid out with much taste in lawns and terraces, contained a valuable collection of indigenous and imported trees and shrubs, and were overlooked by the Assembly Rooms, a handsome building comprising a public hall, a library and reading-room and a billiard-room. The church was beautifully situated in a recess of the mountain.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1905, the [[Kangra valley]] suffered a major earthquake. On 4 April of that year, the earth shook, demolishing much of the cantonment and the neighbouring city of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh]] as well as the Bhagsunag temple. Altogether, the [[1905 Kangra earthquake]] killed 20,000 people. \"1,625 persons perished at Dharams\u0101la alone, including 15 Europeans and 112 of the Gurkha garrison.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nThe Gurkhas rebuilt the town along with the temple, which today is acknowledged as the 1st Gurkha Rifles' heritage. The British had planned to make Dharamshala the summer capital of India, but moved to [[Shimla]] after the disaster.\n\nNot only did the Gurkhas of Dharmshala make a major contribution to India's defence, many were freedom fighters for the [[Indian National Army]], which had been founded by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The Indian National Army Captain [[Ram Singh Thakur]], a Gurkha from the village of Khanyara, composed some of India's most popular and stirring patriotic songs, including \"[[Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja]]\". He is acknowledged so by the Netaji Research Bureau, Kolkata. The important contribution of the noted Gurkha social commentator, the late Master Mitrasen Thapa, from the village of Totarani, has been acknowledged by the Himachal Pradesh government. Recently, a park dedicated to the memory of the late Brigadier Sher Jung Thapa, MVC, the 'Hero of Skardu', has been opened alongside the road between Lower and Upper Dharamshala.\n\n===Establishment of Tibetan exile community===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:20170821 133842000 iOS.jpg|thumb|The architecture in Dharamsala has a Buddhist influence]]\nThe Tibetan settlement of Dharamshala began in 1959, when the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and the [[Indian Prime Minister|Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], allowed him and his followers to settle in McLeodGanj (in Upper Dharmshala), a former colonial British summer picnic spot. \"Nehru was delighted with the 'forgotten ghost-town wasting in the woods', and offered it to the Dalai Lama.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tears of Blood : a Cry for Tibet|last=Craig|first=Mary|publisher=Counterpoint|year=1999|isbn=9781582430256|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=142|oclc=41431635}}</ref> There they established the \"[[Government of Tibet in exile|government-in-exile]]\" in 1960 and the [[Namgyal Monastery]].  Dharamshala had been connected with [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] for a long time, many [[monastery|monasteries]] having been established there in the past, by Tibetan immigrants in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1970, The Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, opened the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] which houses over 80,000 [[manuscripts]] and other important resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for [[Tibetology]] in the world, the new director is Geshe Lahkdor, the old translator of the Dalai Lama.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:20170821 131933000 iOS.jpg|left|thumb|Silver jewellery sold by a Tibetan woman at a stall in McLeodganj]]\n[[File:Kalachakra Temple.jpg|thumb|upright|Kalachakra Temple in the main street of Mcleod ganj]]\nSeveral thousand [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] exiles have now settled in the area; most live in and around [[McLeodGanj]] in Upper Dharamshala, where they have built monasteries, temples and schools. It has become an important tourist destination with many hotels and restaurants, leading to growth in tourism and commerce.\n\nDharamshala is the winter capital of Himachal Pradesh. The Legislative Assembly is at [[Sidhbari]], near the Chinmaya Tapovan Ashram, and the winter sessions of the government are held there. Dharamshala is also one of the famous bird watching spots in India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://petzenia.com/blog/best-bird-watching-spots-india/|title=Some of the Best Bird Watching Spots in India|date=4 December 2016|work=Petzenia Blog|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Transcription and pronunciation===\n[[File:Pejas, scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism, at a library in Dharamsala.jpg|thumb|left|Pejas, scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism, at a library in Dharamsala]]\nDue to a lack of uniform observance of [[transliteration]] and [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] [[Devanagari transliteration|conventions]] for Hindi (and the [[Devanagari]] script in which Hindi is written), the name of the town has been transcribed into English (and other languages using [[Romanization|Romanic scripts]]) variously as ''Dharamshala'', ''Dharamsala'' and, less frequently, ''Dharmshala'' and ''Dharmsala''.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> These four permutations result from two variables: the transcription of the word \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e (dharma)\u2014particularly the second syllable (\u0930\u094d\u092e)\u2014and that of the third syllable (\u0936\u093e).\n\nA strict transliteration of \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e as written would be 'dharma' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259rma]}}. In the modern spoken Hindi of the region, however, there is a common [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain words (including \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' (pronounced somewhere between {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259r\u0259m]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259rm]}}, depending on the speaker). Thus, if the goal of the transcription is phonetic accord with modern spoken Hindi, then 'dharam' and 'dharm' are both legitimate options. Regarding the third syllable, the Devanagari \u0936 corresponds to the English ''sh'' sound, {{IPAblink|\u0283}}. Thus \u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e is transcribed in [[English language|English]] as 'shala'.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate phonetic transcription of the Hindi \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e into Roman script for common (non-technical) English usage is either 'Dharamshala' or, less commonly, 'Dharmshala',<ref name=Devanagari>See [[Devanagari transliteration#Consonants]]</ref> both of which render the ''sh'' ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}) sound of ''\u0936'' in English as 'sh' to convey the correct native pronunciation, 'Dharam''sh''ala' {{IPA|[d\u02b1\u0259r\u0259m\u02c8\u0283a\u02d0la\u02d0]}} or 'Dharm''sh''ala' {{IPA|[d\u02b1\u0259rm\u02c8\u0283a\u02d0la\u02d0]}}).

Traditionally, such ''dharamshalas'' (pilgrims' rest houses) were commonly constructed near pilgrimage destinations (often in remote areas) to give visitors a place to sleep for the night. When the first permanent settlement was created in the place now called Dharamshala, there was one such pilgrims' rest house on the site, and the settlement took its name from that ''Dharamshala''.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_307.gif |title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India |chapter=Dharmsala |volume=XI |pages=301\u2013302 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1908 |via=Digital South Asia Library}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Before the British Raj===\nUntil the [[British Raj]], Dharamshala and its surrounding area was ruled by the [[Katoch]] Dynasty of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]], a royal family that ruled the region for two millennia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091104/himplus.htm#8|title=Seminar on Katoch dynasty trail|date=4 November 2009 |publisher=Tribune India|quote=new findings by researchers suggest \"the Katoch dynasty dates back to 8,000 years and its 300 rulers ruled in the pre-Mahabharata period and the present scion of this clan, Aditya Dev Katoch, is the 488th member of the clan in the lineage\"  The researchers claimed \"this dynasty is not only the oldest ruling clan of India but also the oldest dynasty of the world and its founder, Adipursha, had come from Mongolia about 11,000 years back\".}}</ref> The royal family still keeps a residence in Dharamsala, known as 'Clouds End Villa'.

The Katoch dynasty, although highly regarded culturally, had been reduced to status of [[jagirdar]]s (of [[Kangra-Lambagraon]]) under the Treaty of Jawalamukhi, signed in 1810 between Sansar Chand Katoch and Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sikh Empire]]. The indigenous people of the Dharamshala area (and the surrounding region) are the [[Gaddis]], a predominantly [[Hindu]] group who traditionally lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic [[transhumance|transhumant]] lifestyle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Due to the lack of permanent settlements in the area, some Gaddis lost their seasonal pastures and farmland when the British and the [[Gurkhas]] arrived to settle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Settlement by the British and the Gurkhas===\n[[File:Lord Eligin's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint John's Church in The Wilderness at Dharamsala, built in 1852]]\n[[File:Lord Elgin's Tomb, Dharamshala.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]] at [[St. John in the Wilderness Church (Dharamshala)|St. John in the Wilderness Church]]]]\nIn 1848, the area now known as Dharamshala was annexed by the British.\n\n:\"Dharams\u0101la lies on a spur of the Dhola Dh\u0101r, 16 miles north-east of K\u0101ngra, in the midst of wild and picturesque scenery. It originally formed a subsidiary cantonment for the troops stationed at K\u0101ngra, and was first occupied as a station in 1849, when a site was required for a cantonment to accommodate a Native regiment which was being raised in the District. A site was found upon the slopes of the Dhola Dh\u0101r, in a plot of waste land, upon which stood an old Hindu resthouse, or ''dharms\u0101la'', whence the name adopted for the new cantonment. The civil authorities, following the example of the regimental officers, and attracted by the advantages of climate and scenery, built themselves houses in the neighbourhood of the cantonment; and in 1855 the new station was formally recognised as the headquarters of the [K\u0101ngra] District.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1860, the 66th [[Gurkha]] [[Light Infantry]] was moved from [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh]] to Dharamshala, which was at first made a subsidiary [[cantonment]].

Consequently, fourteen Gurkha platoon villages grew from this settlement, and exist to this day, namely Dari, Ramnagar, Shyamnagar, Dal, Totarani, Khanyara, Sadher, Chaandmaari, Sallagarhi, [[Sidhbari]], [[Yol, India|Yol]], and so on. The Gurkhas worshipped at the ancient [[Shiva]] temple of Bhagsunag. The Gurkhas referred to Dharamshala as 'Bhagsu' and referred to themselves as Bhagsuwalas.\n\nThe 21st Gurkha Regiment from Dharamshala performed heroic feats during [[World War I]] and the North West Frontier Province campaigns. The Gurkha cantonment then reached its zenith during [[World War II]], when battalions from Dharamshala made history. Many place names in the town still retain their former cantonment terminologies: Depot Bazaar, Pensioners' Lines, Tirah Lines (named after the 19th century [[Tirah Campaign]]), Bharatpore Lines (named after the 1826 Battle of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpore]]).\n\nThe second [[Lord Elgin]], [[Viceroy]] of India died here (at the 1st Gurkha Rifles Officers' Mess) in 1863 and is buried in the cemetery of [[St. John in the Wilderness Church (Dharamshala)|St. John in the Wilderness]], a small [[Anglican]] church distinguished by its [[stained-glass]] windows. Dharamshala became a popular [[hill station]] for the British working in or near [[Delhi]], offering a cool respite during the hot summer months.\n\n:\"Before the earthquake of 1905, the upper part of the station, which rises to a height of 7,112 feet [2,168 metres], contained the European houses, the station church, and the officers' mess and lines of the 1st Gurkhas, together with the public gardens, post office, and two bazars, the Forsythganj and McLeodganj. The public offices, a bazar, and a few European houses made up the lower station, as low as 4,500 feet [1,372 metres]. The 1st battalion of the 1st Gurkhas used to be stationed here, but was moved to the upper station in 1894-5.... The public gardens, which were, before the earthquake, laid out with much taste in lawns and terraces, contained a valuable collection of indigenous and imported trees and shrubs, and were overlooked by the Assembly Rooms, a handsome building comprising a public hall, a library and reading-room and a billiard-room. The church was beautifully situated in a recess of the mountain.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1905, the [[Kangra valley]] suffered a major earthquake. On 4 April of that year, the earth shook, demolishing much of the cantonment and the neighbouring city of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh]] as well as the Bhagsunag temple. Altogether, the [[1905 Kangra earthquake]] killed 20,000 people. \"1,625 persons perished at Dharams\u0101la alone, including 15 Europeans and 112 of the Gurkha garrison.\"<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nThe Gurkhas rebuilt the town along with the temple, which today is acknowledged as the 1st Gurkha Rifles' heritage. The British had planned to make Dharamshala the summer capital of India, but moved to [[Shimla]] after the disaster.\n\nNot only did the Gurkhas of Dharmshala make a major contribution to India's defence, many were freedom fighters for the [[Indian National Army]], which had been founded by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The Indian National Army Captain [[Ram Singh Thakur]], a Gurkha from the village of Khanyara, composed some of India's most popular and stirring patriotic songs, including \"[[Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja]]\". He is acknowledged so by the Netaji Research Bureau, Kolkata. The important contribution of the noted Gurkha social commentator, the late Master Mitrasen Thapa, from the village of Totarani, has been acknowledged by the Himachal Pradesh government. Recently, a park dedicated to the memory of the late Brigadier Sher Jung Thapa, MVC, the 'Hero of Skardu', has been opened alongside the road between Lower and Upper Dharamshala.\n\n===Establishment of Tibetan exile community===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:20170821 133842000 iOS.jpg|thumb|The architecture in Dharamsala has a Buddhist influence]]\nThe Tibetan settlement of Dharamshala began in 1959, when the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and the [[Indian Prime Minister|Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], allowed him and his followers to settle in McLeodGanj (in Upper Dharmshala), a former colonial British summer picnic spot. \"Nehru was delighted with the 'forgotten ghost-town wasting in the woods', and offered it to the Dalai Lama.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tears of Blood : a Cry for Tibet|last=Craig|first=Mary|publisher=Counterpoint|year=1999|isbn=9781582430256|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=142|oclc=41431635}}</ref> There they established the \"[[Government of Tibet in exile|government-in-exile]]\" in 1960 and the [[Namgyal Monastery]].

Dharamshala is also one of the famous bird watching spots in India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://petzenia.com/blog/best-bird-watching-spots-india/|title=Some of the Best Bird Watching Spots in India|date=4 December 2016|work=Petzenia Blog|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Transcription and pronunciation===\n[[File:Pejas, scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism, at a library in Dharamsala.jpg|thumb|left|Pejas, scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism, at a library in Dharamsala]]\nDue to a lack of uniform observance of [[transliteration]] and [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] [[Devanagari transliteration|conventions]] for Hindi (and the [[Devanagari]] script in which Hindi is written), the name of the town has been transcribed into English (and other languages using [[Romanization|Romanic scripts]]) variously as ''Dharamshala'', ''Dharamsala'' and, less frequently, ''Dharmshala'' and ''Dharmsala''.<ref name=\"dsal.uchicago.edu\"/> These four permutations result from two variables: the transcription of the word \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e (dharma)\u2014particularly the second syllable (\u0930\u094d\u092e)\u2014and that of the third syllable (\u0936\u093e).\n\nA strict transliteration of \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e as written would be 'dharma' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259rma]}}. In the modern spoken Hindi of the region, however, there is a common [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain words (including \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' (pronounced somewhere between {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259r\u0259m]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u02b1\u0259rm]}}, depending on the speaker). Thus, if the goal of the transcription is phonetic accord with modern spoken Hindi, then 'dharam' and 'dharm' are both legitimate options. Regarding the third syllable, the Devanagari \u0936 corresponds to the English ''sh'' sound, {{IPAblink|\u0283}}. Thus \u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e is transcribed in [[English language|English]] as 'shala'.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate phonetic transcription of the Hindi \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e into Roman script for common (non-technical) English usage is either 'Dharamshala' or, less commonly, 'Dharmshala',<ref name=Devanagari>See [[Devanagari transliteration#Consonants]]</ref> both of which render the ''sh'' ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}) sound of ''\u0936'' in English as 'sh' to convey the correct native pronunciation, 'Dharam''sh''ala' {{IPA|[d\u02b1\u0259r\u0259m\u02c8\u0283a\u02d0la\u02d0]}} or 'Dharm''sh''ala' {{IPA|[d\u02b1\u0259rm\u02c8\u0283a\u02d0la\u02d0]}}). Nonetheless, the alternate spelling 'Dharamsala' continues to be used in some cases despite its inaccuracy, and all four spelling permutations can be found in the English language materials of the local and state governments, in publications, and on the Internet.<ref>See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://hptdc.nic.in/access.htm |title=Access to Himachal Pradesh |publisher=Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation |accessdate=2 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020161645/http://hptdc.nic.in/access.htm |archivedate=20 October 2010 |postscript=, which includes both common spellings on the same page.}}</ref> Regardless of spelling variations, the correct native pronunciation is with the ''sh'' sound ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}).<ref name=Devanagari/> In actual practice, the spelling variant that is most common and most concordant with standards of transcription and native pronunciation is 'Dharamshala'.

After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the [[whistle]], [[gemshorn]], [[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[tin whistle]], [[tonette]], [[fujara]], and [[ocarina]] have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a \"[[fipple]]\"). These are known as '''[[fipple flutes]]'''. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.\n\nAnother division is between '''side-blown''' (or '''[[transverse flute|transverse]]''') flutes, such as the Western concert flute, [[piccolo]], [[fife (musical instrument)|fife]], [[dizi (instrument)|dizi]] and [[bansuri]]; and '''[[end-blown flute]]s''', such as the [[ney]], [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[kaval]], [[danso]], [[shakuhachi]], [[Anasazi flute]] and [[quena]]. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], which are also played [[Vertical flute|vertically]] but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.\n\nFlutes may be open at one or both ends. The [[ocarina]], [[Xun (instrument)|xun]], [[pan pipes]], [[police whistle]], and [[bosun's whistle]] are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.\n\nFlutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple [[Acoustic resonance#Resonance of a tube of air|resonators]] may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).\n\nFlutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use [[nose flute]]s. The [[flue pipe]]s of [[Pipe organ|organs]], which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.\n\n===Western transverse flutes===\n{{Main|Western concert flute}}\n[[File:Flute with musicial notes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Western concert flute]]]]\n\n====Wooden one-keyed transverse flute====\nUsually in D, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such the instrument is often indicated as [[baroque flute]]. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the [[historically informed performance]] practice.\n\n====Western concert flute====\n[[File:Western concert flute.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|An illustration of a [[Western concert flute]]]]\nThe [[Western concert flute]], a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An ''[[embouchure]] hole'' is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's [[Range (music)|range]] were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by [[Theobald Boehm]] and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors.<ref>[[Theobald Boehm|Boehm, Theobald]]. (1964). ''The Flute and Flute-Playing in Acoustical, Technical, and Artistic Aspects'', translated by Dayton C. Miller, with a new introduction by Samuel Baron. New York: Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-21259-9}}, pp.  8\u201312.</ref> With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the [[Boehm system]]. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes even platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually [[African Blackwood]].\n\nThe standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three [[octave]]s starting from [[middle C]] or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means that the concert flute is one of the highest common [[orchestra]] and [[concert band]] instruments.\n\n====Western concert flute variants====\n[[File:Joueuse de fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry.jpg|thumb|right|Center: Piccolo. Right: larger flute]]\nThe [[piccolo]] plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute.  Lower members of the flute family include the [[Alto flute|G alto]] and [[Bass flute|C bass]] flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The [[Contrabass flute|contrabass]], [[Double contrabass flute|double contrabass]], and [[Hyperbass flute|hyperbass]] are other rare forms of the flute pitched two, three, and four octaves below middle C respectively.\n\nOther sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the G treble flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D{{music|flat}} piccolo, [[soprano flute]] (the primary instrument, equivalent to today's concert C flute), F alto flute, and B{{music|flat}} bass flute.\n\n===Indian flutes===\n{{Further|Bansuri|Venu}}\n[[File:Indian bamboo flute.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] eight-holed bamboo flute]]\n\n[[File:Eight Flute1.JPG|thumb|An eight-holed classical Indian bamboo flute.]]\n\nThe bamboo flute is an important instrument in [[Indian classical music]], and developed independently of the Western flute.

The first, the [[Bansuri]] (\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940), has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the [[Hindustani music]] of Northern India. The second, the [[Venu]] or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the [[Carnatic music]] of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists.

Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a ''[[di mo]]'', which is usually a thin tissue paper.  It gives the flute a bright sound.\n\nCommonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (\u6886\u7b1b), qudi (\u66f2\u7b1b), xindi (\u65b0\u7b1b), and dadi (\u5927\u7b1b).

After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the [[whistle]], [[gemshorn]], [[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[tin whistle]], [[tonette]], [[fujara]], and [[ocarina]] have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a \"[[fipple]]\"). These are known as '''[[fipple flutes]]'''. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.\n\nAnother division is between '''side-blown''' (or '''[[transverse flute|transverse]]''') flutes, such as the Western concert flute, [[piccolo]], [[fife (musical instrument)|fife]], [[dizi (instrument)|dizi]] and [[bansuri]]; and '''[[end-blown flute]]s''', such as the [[ney]], [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[kaval]], [[danso]], [[shakuhachi]], [[Anasazi flute]] and [[quena]]. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], which are also played [[Vertical flute|vertically]] but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.\n\nFlutes may be open at one or both ends. The [[ocarina]], [[Xun (instrument)|xun]], [[pan pipes]], [[police whistle]], and [[bosun's whistle]] are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.\n\nFlutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple [[Acoustic resonance#Resonance of a tube of air|resonators]] may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).\n\nFlutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use [[nose flute]]s. The [[flue pipe]]s of [[Pipe organ|organs]], which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.\n\n===Western transverse flutes===\n{{Main|Western concert flute}}\n[[File:Flute with musicial notes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Western concert flute]]]]\n\n====Wooden one-keyed transverse flute====\nUsually in D, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such the instrument is often indicated as [[baroque flute]]. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the [[historically informed performance]] practice.\n\n====Western concert flute====\n[[File:Western concert flute.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|An illustration of a [[Western concert flute]]]]\nThe [[Western concert flute]], a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An ''[[embouchure]] hole'' is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's [[Range (music)|range]] were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by [[Theobald Boehm]] and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors.<ref>[[Theobald Boehm|Boehm, Theobald]]. (1964). ''The Flute and Flute-Playing in Acoustical, Technical, and Artistic Aspects'', translated by Dayton C. Miller, with a new introduction by Samuel Baron. New York: Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-21259-9}}, pp.  8\u201312.</ref> With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the [[Boehm system]]. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes even platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually [[African Blackwood]].\n\nThe standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three [[octave]]s starting from [[middle C]] or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means that the concert flute is one of the highest common [[orchestra]] and [[concert band]] instruments.\n\n====Western concert flute variants====\n[[File:Joueuse de fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry.jpg|thumb|right|Center: Piccolo. Right: larger flute]]\nThe [[piccolo]] plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute.  Lower members of the flute family include the [[Alto flute|G alto]] and [[Bass flute|C bass]] flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The [[Contrabass flute|contrabass]], [[Double contrabass flute|double contrabass]], and [[Hyperbass flute|hyperbass]] are other rare forms of the flute pitched two, three, and four octaves below middle C respectively.\n\nOther sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the G treble flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D{{music|flat}} piccolo, [[soprano flute]] (the primary instrument, equivalent to today's concert C flute), F alto flute, and B{{music|flat}} bass flute.\n\n===Indian flutes===\n{{Further|Bansuri|Venu}}\n[[File:Indian bamboo flute.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] eight-holed bamboo flute]]\n\n[[File:Eight Flute1.JPG|thumb|An eight-holed classical Indian bamboo flute.]]\n\nThe bamboo flute is an important instrument in [[Indian classical music]], and developed independently of the Western flute. The [[Hindu]] God Lord [[Krishna]] is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute. The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of [[bamboo]] and are keyless.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music |last=Arnold |first=Alison |year=2000 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=[[London]] |isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1 |page=354 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC}}</ref>\n\nTwo main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used. The first, the [[Bansuri]] (\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940), has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the [[Hindustani music]] of Northern India. The second, the [[Venu]] or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the [[Carnatic music]] of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri, of the Palladam school, at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dictionary of Hindustani Classical Music |last= Caudhur\u012b|first=Vimalak\u0101nta R\u00f4ya|last2=Roychaudhuri|first2=Bimalakanta |year= 2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publication |location=[[Kolkata]] |isbn=978-81-208-1708-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gQWLa--IHjIC}}</ref>\n[[File:Krishna flute suchindram temple car carving.jpg|thumb|Temple car carving of Krishna playing flute, suchindram, [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]]]\n\nThe quality of the flute's sound depends somewhat on the specific [[bamboo]] used to make it, and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the [[Nagercoil]] area of South India.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rough Guide to South India 3 |last=Abram |first=David |last2=Guides |first2=Rough |last3=Edwards |first3=Nick |last4=Ford |first4=Mike |last5=Sen |first5=Devdan |last6=Wooldridge |first6= Beth |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |location=[[London]] |isbn=978-1-84353-103-6 |pages=670, 671 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sEhJBfbhTAAC}}</ref>\n\nBased on [[Bharata Natya Shastra's|Bharata Natya Shastra]] [[Sarana Chatushtai]], [[Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan]] in 1998 developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten 'thatas' currently present in Indian Classical Music.<ref>Paper authored by Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan unveiling the fundamental principles governing Indian classical music by research on Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra at the National Symposium on Acoustics (1998), ITC Sangeet Research Academy, Calcutta, India.</ref>\n\nIn a regional dialect of Gujarati, a flute is also called Pavo.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AatluOKqQJM</ref> Some people can also play pair of flutes (Jodiyo Pavo) simultaneously.\n\n===Chinese flutes===\n{{Main|Chinese flutes}}\nIn China there are many varieties of [[dizi (instrument)|dizi]] (\u7b1b\u5b50), or Chinese flute, with different sizes, structures (with or without a resonance membrane) and number of holes (from 6 to 11) and intonations (different keys).  Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a ''[[di mo]]'', which is usually a thin tissue paper.  It gives the flute a bright sound.\n\nCommonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (\u6886\u7b1b), qudi (\u66f2\u7b1b), xindi (\u65b0\u7b1b), and dadi (\u5927\u7b1b).

It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic-speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, eventually developed a common [[cultural identity]] as [[Anglo-Saxons]]. This process occurred from the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman rule in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scant contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre, and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on [[Old English]]. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians and archaeologists until the mid- to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants. If this traditional viewpoint were to be correct, the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\nAnother view, which gained popularity at the end of the 20th century, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centered on a warrior elite. This hypothesis suggests that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, initiated a process of [[acculturation]] by the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though  there were marked changes in material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The theory has been criticized by many linguists on the grounds that a complete shift in the language, culture, and place names of England would be impossible with a numerically insignificant immigrant population.\n\nA third view, possibly the most widely held today, posits that a genuine large-scale folk migration of Germanic peoples did occur, but rejects the notion that all of the Romano-Britons were forcefully and deliberately exterminated. In this view, the Anglo-Saxon settlement spanned several centuries and did not involve an extended period of violence; rather, some Britons migrated west, others settled in [[Armorica]], and still others remained living alongside the Anglo-Saxons, but for one reason or another came to adopt their culture and language.\n\nGenetic tests of the English population have produced uncertain, and at times contradictory, results.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}\n\n[[File:End.of.Roman.rule.in.Britain.383.410.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Britain, 383\u2013410{{efn|Based on Jones & Mattingly's Atlas of Roman Britain ({{ISBN|978-1-84217-067-0}}, 1990, reprinted 2007); Mattingly's Imperial Possession ({{ISBN|978-0-14-014822-0}}, 2006); Higham's Rome, Britain, and the Anglo-Saxons ({{ISBN|1-85264-022-7}}, 1992); Frere's Britannia ({{ISBN|0-7102-1215-1}}, 1987); and Snyder's An Age of Tyrants ({{ISBN|978-0-631-22260-6}}) \u2014 the sources are cited in the image legend \u2014 Locations of towns (fortified and unfortified) are given on p. 156, with tribal civitates and coloniae specified on p. 154, of Atlas of Roman Britain.

That cycle of loss and recapture collapsed over the next decade. Eventually, around 410, although Roman power remained a force to be reckoned with for a further three generations across much of [[Gaul]], Britain slipped beyond direct imperial control into a phase which has generally been termed \"sub-Roman\".<ref>P.

Pohl (Leiden, Brill, 2003), pp. 362\u20133</ref>\n\nThe writing of Patrick and Gildas (see below) demonstrates the survival in Britain of Latin literacy and Roman education, learning and law within elite society and Christianity, throughout the bulk of the fifth and sixth centuries. Also, signs in Gildas' works indicate that the economy was thriving without Roman taxation, as he complains of ''luxuria'' and self-indulgence. In the mid fifth century, Anglo-Saxons begin to appear in an apparently still functionally Romanised Britain.<ref>A. B. E.

This type of arrangement was unexceptional in a Late Roman context; Franks had been settled as ''foederati'' on imperial territory in northern Gaul ([[Toxandria]]) in the fourth century, and the [[Visigoths]] were settled in [[Gallia Aquitania]] early in the fifth century. \n#The Saxon ''foederati'' first complained that their monthly supplies were inadequate. Then they threatened to break the treaty, which they did, spreading the onslaught \"from sea to sea\".\n# This war, which Higham called the \"War of the Saxon Federates\", ended some 20\u201330 years later, shortly after the [[Battle of Badon|siege at Mons Badonicus]], and some 40 years before Gildas was born.{{Efn|The phrase which mentions 40 years has been subject of much scholarly discussion. See [[Battle of Badon]] for more details.}}\n# A peace existed with the Saxons, who returned to their eastern home, which Gildas called a ''lugubre divortium barbarorum''\u2014a grievous divorce from the barbarians. The \"divorce settlement\", Higham in particular has argued, was a worse treaty from the British viewpoint. This included the payment of tribute to the people in the east (i.e. the Saxons), who were under the leadership of the person Gildas called ''pater diabolus''.<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 1995\">{{cite book |last=Higham |first=Nick | authorlink=N.

The historical details are, as Snyder had it: \"by-products from his recounting of royal-sins\".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|1998|p=85}}</ref> There is a strong tradition of Christian writers who were concerned with the moral qualities of leadership and Gildas joined these. He used apocalyptic language: for example the Saxons were \"villains\", \"enemies\", led by a Devil-father. Yet, Gildas had lived through, in his own words, an age of \"external peace\", and it is this peace that brought with it the ''tyrannis''\u2014\"unjust rule\".\n\nGildas' remarks reflected his continuing concern regarding the vulnerability of his countrymen and their disregard and in-fighting: for example, \"it was always true of this people (as it is now) that it was weak in beating off the weapons of the enemy, but strong in putting up with civil war and the burden of sin.\"<ref>De Excidio XXI, 1, Winterbottom, Gildas, p. 24.</ref> However, after the War of the Saxon Federates, if there were acts of genocide, mass exodus, or mass slavery, Gildas did not seem to know about them.

Control had been ceded to the Saxons, even control of access to such shrines.

I. 18), a near-contemporary version of the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'']]\n\nGildas and other sources were used by Bede in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', written around 731. Bede identifies the migrants as Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, reporting (Bk I, Ch 15) that the Saxons came from [[Old Saxony]] (Northern Germany) and the Angles from 'Anglia', which lay between the homelands of the Saxons and Jutes.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1843a|pp=72\u201373}}, Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', Bk I, Ch 15.</ref> Anglia is reasonably taken to be the old [[Schleswig-Holstein Province]] (straddling the modern [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Germany|German]] border), and containing the modern [[Angeln]]. Jutland was the homeland of the Jutes, and the coast between the [[Elbe River|Elbe]] and [[Weser River|Weser]] rivers (modern German state of Lower Saxony) is the Saxon area of origin.\n\nCrucially, Bede seems to identify three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial, as implied by the statement that ''Anglus'' was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.<ref>Brugmann, B. I. R. T. E. \"Migration and endogenous change.\" The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology (2011): 30\u201345.</ref> This analysis of Bede has led to a re-evaluation, in terms of continuity and change, of Bede's \"Northumbrian\" view of history and how this view was projected back into the account of the latter two phases of settlement; and a possible overhaul of the traditional chronological framework.\n\nThe concept of [[Bretwalda]] originates in Bede's comment on who held the Imperium of Britain.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1843a|pp=72\u201373}}, Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', Bk 2, Ch 5.</ref> From this concept, historians have inferred a formal institution of overlordship south of the Humber.

Whether the majority were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage, were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture, is unclear, but the balance of opinion is that most were migrants. Notable gaps include: no-one from the East or West Midlands is represented in the list of Bretwaldas, and  some uncertainty exists about the dates of these leaders.\n\nBede's view of Britons is partly responsible for the picture of them as the downtrodden subjects of Anglo-Saxon oppression. This has been used by some linguists and archaeologists to produce invasion and settlement theories involving genocide, [[Ethnic cleansing|forced migration]] and enslavement.<ref>See Coates 2007 for such a view, which is made to fit with Bede's narrative</ref> Bede's depiction of the Britons was probably influenced by what he had read in Gildas, which had  depicted Saxon incursions as punishment from God. Bede's use of ethnic terminology has been questioned, with Windy McKinney observing that it was \"tied to the expression of tradition and religious ideas, to the loyalty of a people to authority, and subject to change as history continued to unfold. Therefore, it is a moot point whether all of those whom Bede encompassed under the term Angli were racially Germanic\".<ref>McKinney, Windy A. \"Creating a gens Anglorum: Social and Ethnic Identity in Anglo-Saxon England through the Lens of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica.\" (2011).</ref> Indeed, Bede himself may not have been an ethnically 'pure' Angle.<ref>[[N.

The inclusion of the 'Elmet-dwellers' suggests to Simon Keynes that the Tribal Hideage was compiled in the early 670s, during the reign of King Wulfhere, since Elmet seems to have reverted thereafter to Northumbrian control.<ref name=\"Keynes, Simon 1995\"/>\n\nIt includes a number of independent kingdoms and other smaller territories and assigns a number of [[hide (unit)|hides]] to each one. A hide was an amount of land sufficient to support a household. The list of tribes is headed by [[Mercia]] and consists almost exclusively of peoples who lived south of the [[Humber]] estuary and territories that surrounded the Mercian kingdom, some of which have never been satisfactorily identified by scholars. The document is problematic, but extremely important for historians, as it provides a glimpse into the relationship between people, land, and the tribes and groups into which they had organised themselves.\n\nThe individual units in the list developed from the settlement areas of tribal groups, some of which are as little as 300 hides. Though some tribes are difficult to locate, the document reveals that the micro-identity of tribe and family was likely important from the start. The list is evidence for more a complex settlement than the single political entity implied by other historical sources.<ref>Davies, Wendy & Hayo Vierck \u2013 The Contexts of the Tribal Hidage: Social Aggregates and Settlement Patterns, Fr\u00fchmittelalterliche Studien 8, 1974</ref>\n\n===''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' is a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England, which was kept from the late 9th to the mid-12th century. The chronicle is a collection of annals that were still being updated in some cases more than 600 years after the events they describe. They contain various entries that seem to add to the breadth of the historical evidence and provide good evidence for a migration, the Anglo-Saxon elites, and various significant historical events.\n\nThe earliest events described in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' were transcribed centuries after they had occurred. [[Barbara Yorke]], Patrick Sims-Williams, and [[David Dumville]], among others, have highlighted how a number of features of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the fifth and early sixth centuries clearly contradict the idea that they contain a reliable year-by-year record.<ref>Dumville, D.N. (1986) 'The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List: manuscripts and texts', in Anglia 104, 1\u201332</ref> Stuart Laycock has suggested that some information describing the early period may be accepted as containing a kernel of truth if the obvious glosses and fictions are rejected (such as the information about Porta and Portsmouth). The sequence of the events associated with [[\u00c6lle of Sussex]] seems plausible, whilst the dates are uncertain.<ref name=\"Laycock, Stuart 2012\">Laycock, Stuart. Britannia-The Failed State: Tribal Conflict and the End of Roman Britain. History Press, 2012.</ref> However, presenting evidence for the Anglo-Saxon settlement from a chronicle such as the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' is uncertain and relies heavily on the present view of which entries are acceptable truth. As Dumville points out about the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'': \"medieval historiography has assumptions different from our own, particularly in terms of distinctions between fiction and non-fiction\".<ref>Kooper, Erik, ed.

The collapse of Roman material culture some time in the early 5th century left a gap in the archaeological record that was quite rapidly filled by the intrusive Anglo-Saxon material culture, while the native culture became archaeologically close to invisible\u2014although recent hoards and metal-detector finds show that coin use and imports did not stop abruptly at AD 410.<ref>Esmonde Cleary, S 1993, 'Approaches to the differences between late Romano-British and early Anglo-Saxon archaeology', Anglo-Saxon Stud Archaeol Hist 6, 57\u20136{{clarify|date=May 2016}}.</ref><ref>H\u00e4rke, H 2007a, 'Invisible Britons, Gallo-Romans and Russians: perspectives on culture change', in Higham (ed), 57\u201367.</ref><ref>Also see Cool, H E M{{clarify|date=May 2016}} 2000, 'The parts left over: material culture into the 5th century', in T Wilmott and P Wilson (eds), The Late Roman Transition in the North, Brit Archaeol Rep Brit Ser 299, 47\u201365.</ref>\n\nThe archaeology of the Roman military systems within Britain is well known but is not well understood: for example, whether the [[Saxon Shore]] was defensive or to facilitate the passage of goods. Andrew Pearson suggests that the \"Saxon Shore Forts\" and other coastal installations played a more significant economic and logistical role than is often appreciated, and that the tradition of Saxon and other continental piracy, based on the name of these forts, is probably a myth.<ref>Pearson, A.

There was a large gap between richest and poorest; the trappings of the latter have been the focus of less archaeological study. However the archaeology of the peasant from the 4th and 5th centuries is dominated by \"ladder\" field systems or enclosures, associated with extended families, and in the South and East of England the extensive use of timber-built buildings and farmsteads shows a lower level of engagement with Roman building methods than is shown by the houses of the numerically much smaller elite.<ref>Hingley, Rural Settlements in Roman Britain 1989</ref>\n\n===Settler evidence===\n[[File:Mucking DSCF9230.JPG|thumb|Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon belt fittings in the [[Quoit Brooch Style]] from the [[Mucking excavation|Mucking Anglo-Saxon cemetery]], early 5th century, using a mainly Roman style for very early Anglo-Saxon clients]]\nConfirmation of the use of Anglo-Saxons as ''[[foederati]]'' or federate troops has been seen as coming from burials of Anglo-Saxons wearing military equipment of a type issued to late Roman forces, which have been found both in late Roman contexts, such as the Roman cemeteries of Winchester and Colchester, and in purely 'Anglo-Saxon' rural cemeteries like [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]] (Essex),<ref>Jones, M U 1980: 'Mucking and Early Saxon rural settlement in Essex.'

London</ref> The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, but we should not assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later [[Viking settlement of Britain|Viking settlers]], may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by [[Sonia Chadwick Hawkes]] as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.<ref>Hawkes, S Chadwick 1982: 'Anglo-Saxon Kent c 425\u2013725.'

Beyond these, in the early Anglo-Saxon period, identity was local: although people would have known their neighbours, it may have been important to indicate tribal loyalty with details of clothing and especially fasteners.<ref>Hills, Catherine. \"Overview: Anglo-Saxon identity.\" The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology (2011): 3\u201312.</ref> It is also unlikely that people would have thought of themselves as Anglo-Saxon: instead they were part of a tribe or region, descendants of a patron or followers of a leader. It is this identity that archaeological evidence seeks to understand and determine, considering how it might support separate identity groups, or identities that were inter-connected.<ref>Brooks, Nicholas. \"The formation of the Mercian Kingdom\", The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms (1989): 159\u2013170.</ref>\n\nPart of a well-furnished pagan-period mixed inhumation-and-cremation cemetery was excavated at [[Alwalton]] near Peterborough. Twenty-eight urned and two unurned cremations dating from between the 5th and 6th centuries, and 34 inhumations, dating from between the late 5th and early 7th centuries, were uncovered. Both cremations and inhumations were provided with pyre or grave goods, and some of the burials were richly furnished. The excavation found evidence for a mixture of practices and symbolic clothing; these reflected local differences that appeared to be associated with tribal or family loyalty. This use of clothing in particular was very symbolic, and distinct differences within groups in the cemetery could be found.<ref>Gibson, C. 2007.

Oxford: Oxford University School of Archaeology.</ref>\n\n===Reuse of earlier monuments===\nThe evidence for monument reuse in the early Anglo-Saxon period reveals a number of significant aspects of the practice. Ancient monuments were one of the most important factors determining the placing of the dead in the early Anglo-Saxon landscape. Anglo-Saxon secondary activity on prehistoric and Roman sites was traditionally explained in practical terms. These explanations, in the view of Howard Williams, failed to account for the numbers and types of monuments and graves (from villas to barrows) reused.<ref name=\"Williams, Howard 1997\">Williams, Howard. \"Ancient Landscapes and the Dead: The Reuse of Prehistoric and Roman Monuments as Early Anglo-Saxon Burial Sites.\" (1997).</ref>\n\nAnglo-Saxon barrow burials started in the late 6th century and continued into the early 8th century. Prehistoric barrows, in particular, have been seen as physical expressions of land claims and links to the ancestors, and John Shephard has extended this interpretation to Anglo-Saxon tumuli.<ref>Shephard, J 1979, 'The social identity of the individual in isolated barrows and barrow cemeteries in Anglo-Saxon England', in B C Burnham and J Kingsbury (eds), Space, Hierarchy and Society, Brit Archaeol Rep Int Ser 59, 47\u201379.</ref> Eva Th\u00e4te has emphasised the continental origins of monument reuse in post-Roman England,<ref>Th\u00e4te, E 1996, 'Alte Denkm\u00e4ler und fr\u00fchgeschichtliche Bestattungen: Ein s\u00e4chsisch-angels\u00e4chsischer Totenbrauch und seine Kontinuit\u00e4t', Arch\u00e4ol Inf 19, 105\u201316</ref> Howard Williams has suggested that the main purpose of this custom was to give sense to a landscape that the immigrants did not find empty.<ref name=\"Williams, Howard 1997\"/>\n\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, monument reuse became so widespread that it strongly suggests the deliberate location of burials of the elite next to visible monuments of the pre-Saxon past, but with 'ordinary' burial grounds of this phase also frequently being located next to prehistoric barrows. The relative increase of this kind of spatial association from the 5th/6th centuries to the 7th/8th centuries is conspicuous. Williams' analysis of two well-documented samples shows an increase from 32% to 50% of Anglo-Saxon burial sites in the Upper Thames region, and from 47% to 71% of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries excavated since 1945. H\u00e4rke suggests that one of the contexts for the increasing reuse of monuments may be \"the adoption by the natives of the material culture of the dominant immigrants\".<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\">{{cite journal |last=H\u00e4rke |first=Heinrich |title=Anglo-Saxon Immigration and Ethnogenesis |journal=Medieval Archaeology |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=1\u201328 |doi=10.1179/174581711X13103897378311}}</ref>\n\n===Landscape archaeology===\nThe Anglo-Saxons did not settle in an abandoned landscape on which they imposed new types of settlement and farming, as was once believed. By the late 4th century the English rural landscape was largely cleared and generally occupied by dispersed farms and hamlets, each surrounded by its own fields but often sharing other resources in common (called \"infield-outfield cultivation\").<ref>Taylor, Christopher. Village and farmstead: a history of rural settlement in England. G. Philip, 1983: 83\u2013106</ref> Such fields, whether of prehistoric or Roman origin, fall into two very general types, found both separately and together: irregular layouts, in which one field after another had been added to an arable hub over many centuries; and regular rectilinear layouts, often roughly following the local topography, that had resulted from the large-scale division of considerable areas of land. Such stability was reversed within a few decades of the 5th century, as early \"Anglo-Saxon\" farmers, affected both by the collapse of Roman Britain and a climatic deterioration which reached its peak probably around 500, concentrated on subsistence, converting to pasture large areas of previously ploughed land. However, there is little evidence of abandoned arable land.\n\nEvidence across southern and central England increasingly shows the persistence of prehistoric and Roman field layouts into and, in some cases throughout, the Anglo-Saxon period, whether or not such fields were continuously ploughed. Landscapes at Yarnton, Oxfordshire, and Mucking, Essex, remained unchanged throughout the 5th century, while at Barton Court, Oxfordshire, the 'grid of ditched paddocks or closes' of a Roman villa estate formed a general framework for the Anglo-Saxon settlement there.<ref>Hammerow, H. Early Medieval Settlements: The Archaeology of Rural Communities in North-West Europe, 400\u2013900. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> Similar evidence has been found at Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire.<ref>Hamerow et al. 2007: 'Anglo-Saxon settlement near Drayton Road, SuttonCourtenay, Berkshire'.

Leicester: pp 69\u201392</ref>\n\n[[Susan Oosthuizen]] has taken this further and establishes evidence that aspects of the \"collective organisation of arable cultivation appear to find an echo in fields of pre-historic and Roman Britain\":<ref>Oosthuizen, Susan. Tradition and Transformation in Anglo-Saxon England: Archaeology, Common Rights and Landscape. Bloomsbury Academic, 2013.</ref> in particular, the open field systems, shared between a number of cultivators but cropped individually; the link between arable holdings and rights to common pasture land; in structures of governance and the duty to pay some of the surplus to the local overlord, whether in rent or duty. Together these reveal that kinship ties and social relations were continuous across the 5th and 6th centuries, with no evidence of the uniformity or destruction, imposed by lords, the savage action of invaders or system collapse. This has implications on how later developments are considered, such as the developments in the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nLandscape studies draw upon a variety of topographical, archaeological and written sources. There are major problems in trying to relate Anglo-Saxon charter boundaries to those of Roman estates for which there are no written records, and by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period there had been major changes to the organisation of the landscape which can obscure earlier arrangements.<ref>Hall, D 1988: 'The late Saxon countryside: villages and their fields.' Hooke (ed) 1988, 99\u2013122</ref> Interpretation is also hindered by uncertainty about late Roman administrative arrangements. Nevertheless, studies carried out throughout the country, in \"British\" as well as \"Anglo-Saxon\" areas, have found examples of continuity of territorial boundaries where, for instance, Roman villa estate boundaries seem to have been identical with those of medieval estates, as delineated in early charters, though settlement sites within the defined territory might shift.<ref>Rodwell, W J and Rodwell, K A 1985: Rivenhall: Investigations of a Villa, Church and Village, 1950\u20131977.</ref> What we see in these examples is probably continuity of the estate or territory as a unit of administration rather than one of exploitation.<ref>Rippon, Stephen, et al. \"The Fields of Britannia: Continuity and Discontinuity in the Pays and Regions of Roman Britain.\" Landscapes 14.1 (2013): 33\u201353.</ref> Although the upper level of Roman administration based on towns seems to have disappeared during the 5th century, a subsidiary system based on subdivisions of the countryside may have continued.<ref>Foard, G 1985: 'The administrative organization of Northamptonshire in the Saxon period.' Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History 4, 185\u2013222</ref>\n\nThe basis of the internal organisation of both the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and those of their Celtic neighbours was a large rural territory which contained a number of subsidiary settlements dependent upon a central residence which the Anglo-Saxons called a ''villa'' in Latin and a ''t\u016bn'' in Old English. These developments suggest that the basic infrastructure of the early Anglo-Saxon local administration (or the settlement of early kings or earls) was inherited from late Roman or [[Sub-Roman Britain]].<ref>Wareham, Andrew. Lords and communities in early medieval East Anglia. Boydell Press, 2005</ref>\n\n===Distribution of settlements===\nThere are a number of difficulties in recognising early Anglo-Saxon settlements as migrant settlers. This in part is because most early rural Anglo-Saxon sites have yielded few finds other than pottery and bone. The use of aerial photography does not yield easily identifiable settlements, partly due to the dispersed nature of many of these settlements.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2011. p119-124\">Hamerow, Helena, David A. Hinton, and Sally Crawford, eds. The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology. OUP Oxford, 2011. p&nbsp;119\u2013124</ref>\n\nThe distribution of known settlements also remains elusive with few settlements found in the West Midlands or North-West. Even in Kent, an area of rich early Anglo-Saxon archaeology, the number of excavated settlements is fewer than expected. However, in contrast the counties of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire are relatively rich in early settlements. These have revealed a tendency for early Anglo-Saxon settlements to be on the light soils associated with river terraces.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2011. p119-124\"/>\n\nMany of the inland settlements are on rivers that had been major navigation routes during the Roman era.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=199}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''. The major inland navigation routes are shown.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Zaluckyj|2001|p=13}}, ''Mercia'', \"Mercia: The Beginnings\", by Sarah Zaluckyj. Zaluckyj states that the Angles travelled up river valleys, specifically mentioning the Trent and Nene.</ref> These sites, such as [[Dorchester on Thames]] on the upper [[River Thames|Thames]],  were readily accessible by the shallow-draught, [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] boats used by the Anglo-Saxons. The same is true of the settlements along the rivers [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]], [[River Trent|Trent]], [[River Witham|Witham]], [[River Nene|Nene]] and along the marshy lower Thames. Less well known due to a dearth of physical evidence but attested by surviving place names, there were Jutish settlements on the [[Isle of Wight]] and the nearby southern coast of  [[Hampshire]].\n\nA number of Anglo-Saxon settlements are located near or at Roman-era towns, but the question of simultaneous town occupation by the Romano-Britons and a nearby Anglo-Saxon settlement (i.e., suggesting a relationship) is not confirmed. At [[Venta Icenorum|Roman Caistor-by-Norwich]], for example, recent analysis suggests that the cemetery post-dates the town's virtual abandonment.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Russo|1998|p=71}}, ''Town Origins and Development in Early England''.</ref>\n\n===Cemetery evidence===\n[[File:Britain.5th.cen.AS.cemeteries.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Early cemeteries of possible Settler origin]]\nThe earliest cemeteries that can be classified as Anglo-Saxon are found in widely separate regions and are dated to the early 5th century.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=317}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''</ref> The exception is in [[Kent]], where the density of cemeteries and artefacts suggest either an exceptionally heavy Anglo-Saxon settlement, or continued settlement beginning at an early date, or both. By the late 5th century there were additional Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, some of them adjacent to earlier ones, but with a large expansion in other areas, and now including the southern coast of [[Sussex]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=318}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''</ref>\n\nUp to the year 2000, roughly 10,000 early 'Anglo-Saxon' cremations and inhumations had been found, exhibiting a large degree of diversity in styles and types of mortuary ritual.<ref>Lucy, Sam. The Anglo-Saxon way of death: burial rites in early England. Sutton Publishing, 2000.</ref> This is consistent with evidence for many micro cultures and local practice. Cemetery evidence is still dominated by the material culture: finds of clothes, jewellery, weapons, pots and personal items; but physical and molecular evidence from skeletons, bones and teeth are increasingly important.\n \nConsidering the early cemeteries of Kent, most relevant finds come from furnished graves with distinctive links to the Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches,<ref name=\"Suzuki, Seiichi 2000\">Suzuki, Seiichi. The quoit brooch style and Anglo-Saxon settlement: a casting and recasting of cultural identity symbols. Boydell & Brewer, 2000.</ref> an important element of female dress that functioned as a fastener, rather like a modern safety pin. The style of brooches (called [[Quoit (brooch)|Quoits]]), is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its design organisation, and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as part of the process of construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society. The brooch shows that culture was not just transposed from the continent, but from an early phase a new \"Anglo-Saxon\" culture was being developed.<ref name=\"Suzuki, Seiichi 2000\"/>\n\nWomen's fashions (''[[tracht]]'', native costumes not thought to have been trade goods), have been used to distinguish and identify settlers,<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Yorke|2006|p=57}}, ''The Conversion of Britain c.600\u2013800''.</ref> supplemented by other finds that can be related to specific regions of the Continent. A large number of [[Franks|Frankish]] artefacts have been found in Kent, and these are largely interpreted to be a reflection of trade and commerce rather than early migration. [[Barbara Yorke|Yorke]] (''Wessex in the Early Middle Ages'', 1995), for example, only allows that some Frankish settlement is possible.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Yorke|1995|p=43}}, ''Wessex in the Early Middle Ages''.</ref> Frankish sea raiding was recorded as early as 260<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|p=47}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''.</ref> and became common for the next century, but their raids on Britain ended c. 367<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|p=111}}, ''Dark Age Naval Power''.</ref> as Frankish interest turned southward and was thereafter focused on the control and occupation of northern [[Gaul]] and [[Germania]].\n\nThe presence of artefacts that are identifiably North Germanic along the coastal areas between the [[Humber Estuary]] and East Anglia indicates that Scandinavians migrated to Britain.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Yorke|1995|p=31}}, ''Wessex in the Early Middle Ages''.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|pp=308\u2013309}}, ''Atlas of Roman Britain''.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Yorke|1990|p=61}}, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'', \"The East Angles\".</ref><ref name=Brown151>{{Harvcolnb|Brown|2001|p=151}}, ''Mercia'', \"The Archaeology of Mercia\", by Martin Welch.</ref> However, this does not suggest that they arrived at the same time as the Angles: they may have arrived almost a century later,<ref name=Brown151/><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|2003|p=86}}, ''The Britons'', \"Britons and Saxons\". Snyder says that they arrived in the late 5th century.</ref> and their status and influence upon arrival is uncertain. In particular, regarding a significant Swedish influence in association with the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship and a Swedish origin for the East Anglian [[Wuffing]]a dynasty, both possibilities are now considered uncertain.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Kirby|2000|p=16}}, ''The Earliest English Kings''.</ref>\n\nThe process of mixing and assimilation of immigrant and native populations is virtually impossible to elucidate with material culture, but the skeletal evidence may shed some light on it. The 7th/8th-century average stature of male individuals in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dropped by 15&nbsp;mm (\u215d in) compared with the 5th/6th-century average.<ref>H\u00e4rke, H 1992a, Angels\u00e4chsische Waffengr\u00e4ber des 5. bis 7.

Given the lower average stature of Britons, the most likely explanation would be a gradual Saxonisation or Anglicisation of the material culture of native enclaves, an increasing assimilation of native populations into Anglo-Saxon communities, and increasing intermarriage between immigrants and natives within Anglo-Saxon populations. Skeletal material from the Late Roman and Early Anglo-Saxon period from Hampshire was directly compared. It was concluded that the physical type represented in urban Roman burials, was not annihilated nor did it die-out, but it continued to be well represented in subsequent burials of Anglo-Saxon date.<ref>Arnold, C J 1984, Roman Britain to Saxon England, London: Croom Helm., 130</ref>\n\nAt Stretton-on-Fosse II (Warwickshire), located on the western fringes of the early Anglo-Saxon settlement area, the proportion of male adults with weapons is 82%, well above the average in southern England. Cemetery II, the Anglo-Saxon burial site, is immediately adjacent to two Romano-British cemeteries, Stretton-on-Fosse I and III, the latter only {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} away from Anglo-Saxon burials. Continuity of the native female population at this site has been inferred from the continuity of textile techniques (unusual in the transition from the Romano-British to the Anglo-Saxon periods), and by the continuity of epigenetic traits from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon burials. At the same time, the skeletal evidence demonstrates the appearance in the post-Roman period of a new physical type of males who are more slender and taller than the men in the adjacent Romano-British cemeteries.<ref>Ford, W J 2002, 'The Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon settlement and cemeteries at Stretton on-Fosse, Warwickshire', Trans Birmingham Warwickshire Archaeol Soc 106, 1\u2013115.</ref> Taken together, the observations suggest the influx of a group of males, probably most or all of them Germanic, who took control of the local community and married native women. It is not easy to confirm such cases of 'warband' settlement in the absence of detailed skeletal, and other complementary, information, but assuming that such cases are indicated by very high proportions of weapon burials, this type of settlement was much less frequent than the kin group model.<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\"/>\n\nNick Higham outlines the main questions: \n<blockquote>\"It is fairly clear that most Anglo-Saxon cemeteries are unrepresentative of the whole population, and particularly the whole age range. This was, therefore, a community which made decisions about the disposal of the dead based upon various factors, but at those we can barely guess. Was the inclusion of some but not all individuals subject to political control, or cultural screening? Was this a mark of ethnicity or did it represent a particular kinship, real or constructed, or the adherents of a particular cult? Was it status specific, with the rural proletariat \u2013 who would have been the vast majority of the population \u2013 perhaps excluded? So are many of these cemeteries associated with specific, high-status households and weighted particularly towards adult members? We do not know, but the commitment of particular parts of the community to an imported and in some senses 'Germanic', cremation ritual does seem to have been considerable, and is something which requires explanation.\"<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 2004\">Higham, Nick. \"From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages.\" History Compass 2.1 (2004).</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Molecular evidence==\nResearchers have employed various forms of molecular evidence to investigate the relative importance of immigration, the acculturation of natives and inter-marriage in the creation of Anglo-Saxon England.\n\n===Y-chromosome evidence===\nThe inheritance of DNA is a complex process that varies between male and female individuals. Consequently, this allows the study of separate female and male lineages using mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA, respectively.<ref>Renfrew, C. & Bahn, P. 2008. Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice. London: Thames & Hudson p. 464</ref> Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA for short) and Y-chromosome DNA differ from the DNA of diploid nuclear chromosomes in that they are not formed from the combination of both parents' genes. Rather, males inherit the Y-chromosome directly from their fathers, and both sexes inherit mtDNA directly from their mothers. Consequently, they preserve a genetic record from individual to individual that is altered only through mutation. \n[[File:Weal.png|upright=1.45|thumb|right|Map of Y-chromosome distribution from data derived from \"Y chromosome evidence for Anglo-Saxon mass migration\" by Weale ''et al.''

Friesland was selected for the study due to it being regarded as a source location for Anglo-Saxon migrants, and because of the similarities between Old English and Frisian. Samples from Norway were also compared, as this is a source of the later [[Viking invasion of Britain|Viking migrations]]. The research published in 2003 found that in England 50% to 100% of paternal genetic inheritance was derived from incomers originating in the Germanic coastlands of the North Sea.<ref>Weale, M.E et al.

This study suggested that in most of England, continental (North German and Danish) paternal genetic input varied between 20% and 40%, with York forming an outlier at about 60%. Southern England, including Kent, had markedly lower frequencies of non-indigenous Y-chromosome markers than eastern England, where Danish Viking settlement is attested. However, the study could not distinguish between North German and Danish populations, thus the relative proportions of genetic input derived from the Anglo-Saxon settlements and later Danish Viking colonisation could not be ascertained.<ref>Capelli, C. et al.

In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the [[Belgae]] and other continental people \u2013 and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons \u2013 arrived earlier and were already strong in the 5th century in particular regions or areas.<ref name=\"oppenheimer\">Oppenheimer, Stephen (2006). The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story: Constable and Robinson, London. {{ISBN|978-1-84529-158-7}}.</ref> Oppenheimer, basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have had a significant impact on the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the [[Basque people]] of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]], from 90% in [[Wales]] to 66% in [[East Anglia]].{{r|oppenheimer}} Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow \u2013 one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe \u2013 which occurred just after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].{{r|oppenheimer}} [[Bryan Sykes]], a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called ''Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History'', published in the United States and Canada as ''Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland''. Many feasible scenarios can be constructed to account for evidence. However, Y-chromosome evidence relies on the archaeological and historical evidence for interpretation, and there is a danger of creating a circular argument. Therefore, scenarios that are not justified by other evidence or are created to account for the historical evidence have not been universally accepted.\n\n=== Ancient DNA, rare alleles and whole genome sequencing ===\n====Modern population studies====\nA major study in 2015 by Leslie et al. on the fine scale genetic structure of the British population revealed a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography in the British Isles, showing clear signals of historical demographic events. Based on two separate analyses, the study found clear evidence in modern England of the Anglo-Saxon migration and identified the regions not carrying genetic material from these migrations, but with each analysis limiting the proportion of Saxon ancestry and clearly excluding the possibility of long-term Saxon replacement. The proportion of Saxon ancestry in Central/Southern England was found to be very likely under 50%, and most likely in the range 10%\u201340%. Additionally, in the 'non-Saxon' parts of the UK there was found to exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general 'Celtic' population.<ref>Leslie et al. (2015) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632200/ The fine scale genetic structure of the British population]</ref>\n\n====Ancient DNA studies====\nIn 2016, through the investigation of burials using ancient DNA techniques, researchers found evidence of intermarriage and mixed ancestry in the earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement. The highest status grave of the burials investigated, as evidenced by the associated goods, was that of a female of local, British, origins. It is notable that people of native, immigrant and mixed  ancestry were buried in the same cemetery, with grave goods from the same material culture, without any discernable distinction. The authors remark that their results run contrary to previous theories that have postulated strict reproductive segregation between natives and incomers. By studying rare alleles and employing whole genome sequencing, it was claimed that the continental and insular origins of the ancient remains could be discriminated, and it was calculated that a range of 25\u201340% of the ancestry of modern Britons is attributable to continental 'Anglo-Saxon' origins. The breakdown of the estimates given in this work into the modern populations of Britain determined that the population of eastern England is consistent with 38% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, with a large spread from 25 to 50%, and the Welsh and Scottish samples are consistent with 30% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, again with a large spread. The study also found that there is a small but significant difference between the mean values in the three modern British sample groups, with East English samples sharing slightly more alleles with the Dutch, and Scottish samples looking more like the Iron Age (Celtic) samples.<ref>{{Cite news|title = English DNA 'one-third' Anglo-Saxon \u2013 BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35344663|access-date = 2016-02-17|language = en-GB|date = 2016-01-19|last1 = Rincon|first1 = Paul}}</ref><ref>Schiffels, S.

However, the number of studies is small. Strontium data in a 5th\u20137th-century cemetery in [[West Heslerton]] implied the presence of two groups: one of \"local\" and one of \"nonlocal\" origin. Although the study suggested that they could not define the limits of local variation and identify immigrants with confidence, they could give a useful account of the issues.<ref>Montgomery, Janet, et al. \"Continuity or colonization in Anglo-Saxon England?

Furthermore, they found that there was no change in this pattern over time, except amongst some females.<ref>Hughes, Susan S., et al. \"Anglo-Saxon origins investigated by isotopic analysis of burials from Berinsfield, Oxfordshire, UK.\" Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014): 81\u201392.</ref>\n\nAnother isotopic method has been employed to investigate whether protein sources in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex. This would provide evidence for social advantage. The results suggest that protein sources varied little according to geographic location and that terrestrial foods dominated at all locations.<ref>Mays, S., and N. Beavan. \"An investigation of diet in early Anglo-Saxon England using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen.\" Journal of Archaeological Science 39.4 (2012): 867\u2013874.</ref>\n\n==Migration and acculturation theories==\n[[File:Anglo.Saxon.migration.5th.cen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Possible routes of Anglo-Saxon migration in the 5th/6th centuries]]\nVarious scholars have used a synthesis of evidence to present models to suggest an answer to the questions that surround the Anglo-Saxon settlement. These questions include: How many migrants were there? When did the \"Saxons\" gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation{{efn|The sudden and drastic change from Romano-Britainto Anglo-Saxon Britain was once widely accepted as providing clear evidence for a mass migration from continental Europe and the near-complete replacement of the indigenous population in England}} of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation.  Heinrich H\u00e4rke explains the nature of this agreement: <blockquote>\"It is now widely accepted that the Anglo-Saxons were not just transplanted Germanic invaders and settlers from the Continent, but the outcome of insular interactions and changes. But we are still lacking explicit models that suggest how this ethnogenetic process might have worked in concrete terms\".<ref>In the abstract for: H\u00e4rke, Heinrich. \"Anglo-Saxon Immigration and Ethnogenesis.\" Medieval Archaeology 55.1 (2011): 1\u201328.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Estimating continental migrants' numbers===\nKnowing the number of migrants who came from the continent provides a context from which scholars can build an interpretation framework and understanding of the events of the 5th and 6th centuries. Robert Hedges in discussing this point observes that \"archaeological evidence only addresses these issues indirectly.\"<ref name=\"Hedges, Robert 2011. pp 81-83\">{{cite book|last=Hedges|first= Robert|chapter= Anglo-Saxon migration and the molecular evidence|title=The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology|editor1-last= Hamerow|editor1-first=Helena|editor2-last= Hinton|editor2-first=David A.|editor3-last= Crawford|editor3-first=Sally|location= Oxford, UK|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2011|pages=81\u201383|isbn=9780199212149|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=xucNJfS42PwC&pg=PA79&dq=anglo-saxon+migration#v=onepage&q=anglo-saxon%20migration&f=false}}</ref> \nThe traditional methodology used by archaeology to estimate the number of migrants starts with a figure for the population in Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries. This is usually estimated at between 2 and 4 million.<ref>Millet, Martin. \"The Romanization of Britain.\" An Essay in Archaeological Interpretation (1990).</ref> From this figure it is estimated that the population of Southern and Eastern England is 1 million. Within 200 years the settlement density has been established as an Anglo-Saxon village every {{convert|2|-|5|km|abbr=off}}, in the areas where evidence has been gathered.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. \"The earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History 1 (2005): 263\u201390.</ref> Given that these settlements are typically of around 50 people, this implies an Anglo-Saxon population in Southern and Eastern England of 250,000. This estimate is hardly certain, but does provide a ratio of 1 to 4 between those with a settler background and those with an insular background.\n\nThe number of migrants therefore depends on the population increase variable. If the population rose by 1 per cent per year (which is slightly less than the present world population growth rate) this would suggest a population of 30,000 migrants. However, if the population rose by 2 percent per year (which is similar to India in the last 20 years) this would suggest a population of 5,000 migrants.<ref name=\"Hedges, Robert 2011. pp 81-83\"/>\n\nThis number is confirmed by the archaeological evidence. The excavations at Spong Hill, for example, revealed over 2,000 cremations and inhumations in what is a very large early cemetery. However, when the period of use is taken into account (over 200 years) and its size, it is presumed to be a major cemetery for the entire area and not just one village; it does point to a smaller rather than larger number of original immigrants of 20,000.<ref>The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Spong Hill, North Elmham. Norfolk Archaeological Unit, 1995.</ref>\n\nHeinrich H\u00e4rke concluded that \"most of the biological and cultural evidence points to a minority immigration on the scale of 10 to 20% of the native population. The immigration itself was not a single \u2018invasion\u2019, but rather a series of intrusions and immigrations over a considerable period, differing from region to region, and changing over time even within regions. The total immigrant population may have numbered somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 over about a century, but the geographical variations in numbers, and in social and ethnic composition, should have led to a variety of settlement processes.\"<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\"/>\n\nGenerally, the problems associated with seeking estimates for the population before AD 1089 were set out by Mark Thomas, Michael Stumpf and Heinrich H\u00e4rke. They suggest that \"Incidental reports of numbers of immigrants are notoriously unreliable, and absolute numbers of immigrants before the Norman period can only be calculated as a proportion of the estimated overall population.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2008\">Thomas, Mark G., Michael PH Stumpf, and Heinrich H\u00e4rke. \"Integration versus apartheid in post-Roman Britain: a response to Pattison.\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 275.1650 (2008): 2419\u20132421.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy between, on the one hand, archaeological and some historical ideas about the scale of the Anglo-Saxon immigration, and on the other, estimates of the genetic contribution of the Anglo-Saxon immigrants to the modern English gene pool ([[#Molecular evidence|see \"Molecular evidence\" above]]). Mark Thomas, Michael Stumpf and Heinrich H\u00e4rke created a statistical study of the two groups: those who held the \"Migrant\" Y chromosome and those that didn't. They examined the effect of differential reproductive success between those groups, coupled with limited intermarriage between the groups, on the spread of the genetic variant to discover whether the levels of migration needed to meet a 50% contribution to the modern gene pool. What they found is the genetic pool can rise from less than 5% to more than 50% in as little as 200 years with the addition of a slight increase in reproduction advantage of 1.8 (meaning a ratio 51.8 to 50) and restricting the amount of female (migrant genes) and male (indigenous genes) inter-breeding to at most 10%.<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2006\"/>\n\n===\"Saxon\" political ascendancy in Britain===\n[[File:Saxon.emigration.5th.cen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Areas which are the most probable areas for Settler communities]]\n\nA re-evaluation of the traditional picture of decay and dissolution in post-Roman Britain has occurred, with [[sub-Roman Britain]] being thought rather more a part of the Late Antique world of western Europe than was customary a half century ago.<ref>A. S. Esmonde Cleary, 'The Roman to medieval transition', in Britons and Romans: advancing an archaeological agenda, eds S. James and M. Millett (York, Council for British Archaeology Research Report 125, 2001), pp. 90\u20137.</ref> As part of this re-evaluation some suggest that sub-Roman Britain, in its entirety, retained a significant political, economic and military momentum across the fifth century and even the bulk of the sixth. This in large part stems from attempts to develop visions of British success against the incoming Anglo-Saxons, as suggested by the Chronicles which were written in the ninth and mid-tenth century. However, recent scholarship has contested the extent to which either can be credited with any level of historicity regarding the decades around AD 500.<ref>D. N. Dumville, 'Sub-Roman Britain: History and legend', History, 62, 1977, pp. 173\u201392; Dumville, 'The historical value of the Historia Brittonum', Arthurian Literature, 6, 1986, pp. 1\u201326</ref>\n \nThe representation of long-lasting British triumphs against the Saxons appears in large parts of the Chronicles, but stems ultimately from Gildas's brief and frustratingly elusive reference to a British victory at [[Mons Badonicus]] \u2013 Mount Badon ([[#Historical evidence|see historical evidence above]]). Nick Higham suggests that the war between Britons and Saxons seems to have ended in some sort of compromise, which conceded a very considerable sphere of influence within Britain to the incomers. According to Higham;\n:The most developed vision of a \u2018big\u2019 sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own political and military destiny for well over a century, is that of Kenneth Dark, who has argued that Britain should not be divided during the fifth, and even the bulk of the sixth, century into \u2018British\u2019 and \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 cultural and/or political provinces, but should be thought of as a generally \u2018British\u2019 whole. His thesis, in brief, is to postulate not just survival but continuing cultural, political and military power for the sub-Roman elite, both in the far west (where this view is comparatively uncontroversial) but also in the east, where it has to be imagined alongside incoming settlements. He postulates the sub-Roman community to have been the dominant force in insular affairs right up to c.570.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Nick|last=Higham|title=From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages|journal=History Compass|date=January 2004|volume=2|issue=1|pages=**|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2004.00085.x}}</ref>\n\nKenneth Dark's argument for continuing British military and political power in the east rests on the very uneven distribution of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries and the proposition that large gaps in that distribution necessarily represent strong British polities which excluded Anglo-Saxon settlers by force.<ref>Dark, K., Civitas to Kingdom: British Political Continuity 300\u201380 (London, Leicester University Press, 1994) p&nbsp;97\u2013104</ref> Cremation cemeteries in eastern Britain north of the Thames begin during the second quarter of the fifth century,<ref>J.

Wollman (Heidelberg, Carl Winter, 1990), pp. 17\u201336.</ref> backed up by new archaeological phases before 450 ([[#Archaeological evidence|see Archaeological evidence above]]). The chronology of this \"adventus\" of cremations is supported by the [[Gallic Chronicle of 452]], which states that wide parts of Britain fell under Saxon rule in 441. However, this did not result in many Brittonic words entering Old English. It seems therefore that no large-scale interaction occurred between incoming \"Germanic\" communities and numerous indigenous Brittonic speakers of equivalent social rank. If such interaction had been widespread, then we might have expected far greater language borrowing both in terms of structure and vocabulary ([[#Linguistic evidence|see linguistic evidence above]]).\n\n==='Romano-Brittonic' peoples' fate in the south-east===\nThe most extreme estimation for the size of the Anglo-Saxon settlement suggests that some 80% of the resident population of Britain were not Anglo-Saxon. Given that, explanation has been sought to account for the change in culture of the Britons to one where by the 8th Century the majority of people in southern Britain saw themselves as heirs to the Anglo-Saxon culture. Whilst the developments were rather complicated, there are two competing theories.\n\nOne theory, first set out by [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], suggests that the Anglo Saxons and the Britons were competing cultures, and that through invasion, extermination, slavery, and forced resettlement the Anglo-Saxons defeated the Britons and consequently their culture and language prevailed.<ref>Freeman, E.A. (1869) ''Old English History for Children'', MacMillan, London, pp. 7, 27\u201328</ref>\nThis view has influenced much of the linguistic, scholarly and popular perceptions of the process of anglicisation in Britain. It remains the starting point and 'default position', to which other hypotheses are compared in modern reviews of the evidence.<ref>Grimmer, M. (2007) ''Invasion, Settlement or Political Conquest: Changing Representations of the Arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain'', Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association, 3(1) pp. 169\u2013186.</ref> Widespread extermination and displacement of the native peoples of Britain is still considered a viable possibility by certain scholars.<ref>Ausenda, G. (1997) ''Current issues and future directions in the study of the early Anglo-Saxon period'', in Hines, J. (ed.) ''The Anglo-Saxons from Migration Period to the Eighth Century'', Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology, pp. 411\u2013450</ref>  Our best contemporary source, Gildas, certainly suggests that just such a change of populations did take place. However, Freeman's ideas did not go unchallenged, even as they were being propounded. In particular, the essayist [[Grant Allen]] believed in a strong Celtic contribution to Englishness.\n\nAnother theory has challenged this view and started to examine evidence that the majority of [[Anglo Saxons]] were [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]] in origin. The major evidence comes firstly from the figures, taking a fairly high Anglo-Saxon figure (200,000) and a low Brittonic one (800,000), Britons are likely to have outnumbered Anglo-Saxons by at least four to one. The interpretation of such figures is that while \"culturally, the later Anglo-Saxons and English did emerge as remarkably un-British,&nbsp;... their genetic, biological make-up is none the less likely to have been substantially, indeed predominantly, British\".<ref>Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" The English Historical Review 115.462 (2000): page 523</ref>\n\nTwo processes leading to Anglo-Saxonisation have been proposed. One is similar to culture changes observed in Russia, North Africa and parts of the Islamic world, where a politically and socially powerful minority culture becomes, over a rather short period, adopted by a settled majority. This  process is usually termed 'elite dominance'.<ref name=\"Ward-Perkins, Bryan 2000\">Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" The English Historical Review 115.462 (2000): 513\u2013533.</ref>\n\nThe second process is explained through incentives, such as the [[Wergild]] outlined in the law code of Ine of Wessex which produced an incentive to become Anglo-Saxon or at least English speaking.<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2006\"/> The wergild of an Englishman was set at a value twice that of a Briton of similar wealth. However, some Britons could be very prosperous and own five hides of land, which gave [[thegn]]-like status, with a wergild of 600 shillings.<ref>Lavelle, R. (2010) ''Alfred's Wars: Sources and Interpretations of Anglo-Saxon Warfare in the Viking Age'', Boydell & Brewer p. 85</ref> Ine set down requirements to prove guilt or innocence, both for his English subjects and for his British subjects, who were termed 'foreigners/wealas' ('Welshmen').<ref name=attenborough52>Attenborough. [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/34/mode/2up The laws of Ine and Alfred. pp.&nbsp;35\u201361]</ref> The binary ethnic distinction that appears in Ine's Laws seems to be between ' Englisc/English ('us') and 'Wylisc/Welsh' ('them'). Since Ine's people self-identified as Saxons (West Saxons) this very early use of the word 'English' (unless it is a later introduction into the text) suggests that it was the use of a particular language, already recognised as a single language, and already called 'English', that was the crucial determinant in ethnic identity. This implies that in the early Anglo-Saxon period it was language use that was the key determination of ethnicity, and not whether you had \"Germanic\" ancestors.\n\nWhatever the case, a continuity of 'sub-Roman' Britons cannot be doubted, as evidenced, for example, by the sheer number of burials which already date to the late 5th and early 6th centuries \u2013 otherwise impossible to maintain by even the largest 'migration' estimates. In addition to the 'highland Tyrants' in the west, the case has been made by persistence of a 'native', post-Roman, polity of sorts ''south'' of the Thames during much of the fifth century \u2013 evidenced by the oppositional deposition of [[Quoit Brooch Style]] artefacts in inhumation burials south of the Thames versus 'Scandinavian' artefacts (such as 'square headed brooches') within predominantly cremation burial settings dominate ''north'' of the Thames (i.e. in \"Anglian\" areas). However, a take-over by continental migrants cannot be denied, as evidenced by an abrupt end of Quoit Broch style artefacts and inundation of exotic artefacts of a \"Jutish' character in the final decade or two of the fifth century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Suzuki|2000|pp=114\u2013121}}</ref> Thus Ken Dark's notion of a long chronology of a surviving, even dominant \"sub-Roman\" Britain finds little support.<ref>{{harvtxt|Higham| 2004|p= 4}}</ref> Moreover, Halsall argues that 'Britons' are scarcely if at all visible in the archaeological record of lowland England by the 6th century and beyond, not because of any bizarre notions of ethnic cleansing or 'apartheid', but simply because, by then, everyone was an 'Anglo-Saxon', whatever their geographic origin.<ref>{{harvtxt|Haslsall|2006 |P=232-4}}</ref>\n\n==Aspects of the success of the Anglo-Saxon settlement==\nThe reasons for the success of Anglo-Saxon settlements remain uncertain. [[Helena Hamerow]] has made an observation that in Anglo-Saxon society \"local and extended kin groups remained&nbsp;... the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period\". \"Local and extended kin groups\" is one of a number of possible reasons for success, along with societal advantages, freedom and the relationship to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish in the fifth and sixth centuries.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.p166</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Saxon political formation===\nNick Higham is convinced that the success of the Anglo-Saxon elite in gaining an early compromise shortly after the [[Battle of Badon]] is a key to the success of the culture. This produced a political ascendancy across the south and east of Britain, which in turn required some structure to be successful.<ref>Higham Nicholas J. \"From Tribal Chieftains to Christian Kings.\" The Anglo-Saxon World (2013): 126.</ref>\n\nThe Bretwalda concept is taken as evidence for a presence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families and a clear unitary oversight. Whether the majority of these leaders were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage they were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture is unclear. The balance of opinion is that most were migrants, although it shouldn't be assumed they were all Germanic ([[#Elite personal names evidence|see Elite personal names evidence]]). There is agreement that these were small in number and proportion, yet large enough in power and influence to ensure \"Anglo-Saxon\" acculturation in the lowlands of Britain.<ref>Yorke, Barbara. \"The vocabulary of Anglo-Saxon overlordship.\" Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History. BAR British Series 92 (1981): 171\u2013200.</ref> Most historians believe these elites were those named by Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and others, although there is discussion regarding their [[Floruit|floruit dates]]. Importantly, whatever their origin or when they flourished, they established their claim to lordship through their links to extended kin ties. As Helen Peake jokingly points out \"they all just happened to be related back to Woden\".<ref>Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain, Programme 2 \u2013 Three part Channel 4 series. 2004</ref>\n\nThe [[Tribal Hidage]] is evidence of the existence of numerous smaller provinces, meaning that southern and eastern Britain may have lost any macro-political cohesion in the fifth and sixth centuries and fragmented into many small autonomous units, though late Roman administrative organisation of the countryside may have helped dictate their boundaries. By the end of the sixth century the leaders of these communities were styling themselves kings, with the majority of the larger kingdoms based on the south or east coasts.<ref name=\"Davies, Wendy 2011\">Davies, Wendy, and Hayo Vierck. \"The contexts of Tribal Hidage: social aggregates and settlement patterns.\" Issues 44 (2011).</ref> They include the provinces of the Jutes of Hampshire and Wight, the South Saxons, Kent, the East Saxons, East Angles, Lindsey and (north of the Humber) Deira and Bernicia. Several of these kingdoms may have their foundation the former Roman civitas and this has been argued as particularly likely for the provinces of Kent, Lindsey, Deira and Bernicia, all of whose names derive from Romano-British tribal or district names.<ref name=\"Laycock, Stuart 2012\"/>\n\nThe southern and east coasts were, of course, the areas settled first and in greatest numbers by the settlers and so presumably were the earliest to pass from Romano-British to Anglo-Saxon control. Once established they had the advantage of easy communication with continental territories in Europe via the North Sea or the Channel. The east and south coast provinces may never have fragmented to the extent of some areas inland and by the end of the sixth century they were already beginning to expand by annexing smaller neighbours. Barbara Yorke suggests that such aggressiveness must have encouraged areas which did not already possess military protection in the form of kings and their armies to acquire their own war-leaders or protection alliances.<ref name=\"Yorke, Barbara 2002\"/> By the time of the Tribal Hidage there were also two large 'inland' kingdoms, those of the Mercians and West Saxons, whose spectacular growth we can trace in par in our sources for the seventh century, but it is not clear how far this expansion had proceeded by the end of the sixth century.<ref name=\"Davies, Wendy 2011\"/>\n\nWhat Bede seems to imply in his ''Bretwalda'' list of the elite is the ability to extract tribute and overawe and/or protect communities, which may well have been relatively short-lived in any one instance, but ostensibly \"Anglo-Saxon\" dynasties variously replaced one another in this role in a discontinuous but influential and potent roll call of warrior elites, with very few interruptions from other \"British\" warlords.<ref>Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 5.</ref> The success of this elite was felt beyond their geography, to include neighbouring British territories in the centre and west of what later became England, and even the far west of the island. Again, Bede was very clear that English imperium could on occasion encompass British and English kingships alike,<ref>As in his remarks on Edwin's imperium: Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 5, 9.</ref> and that Britons and Angles marched to war together in the early seventh century, under both British and English kings.<ref>As in his remarks concerning C\u00e6dwallon and Penda, Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 20.</ref> It is Bede who provides the most vivid picture of a late sixth- and early seventh-century Anglian warlord in action, in the person of [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria]], King of [[Bernicia]] (a kingdom with a non-English name), who rapidly built up a personal 'empire' by military victories over the Britons of the North, the [[D\u00e1l Riata|Scots of Dalriada]], the [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Angles of Deira]] and the Britons of north-eastern Wales, only ultimately to experience disaster at the hands of [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia]].<ref>Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, I, 34; II, 12.</ref>\n\n===Rural freedoms and kinship groups===\nWhere arable cultivation continued in early Anglo-Saxon England, there seems to have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, although we do not know whether there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.<ref>Hamerow, H. \"Early medieval settlement.\" The archaeology of rural communities in north-west Europe (2002): 400\u2013900.</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons settled in small groups covering a handful of widely dispersed local communities.<ref name=\"Wickham 2009 157\">{{Harvcolnb|Wickham|2009|p=157}}, ''The Inheritance of Rome''.</ref> These farms were for the most part mobile. This mobility, which was typical across much of Northern Europe took two forms: the gradual shifting of the settlement within its boundaries or the complete location of the settlement altogether. These shifting settlements (called ''Wandersiedlungen'' or \"wandering settlements\") were a common feature since the Bronze Age. Why farms became abandoned and then relocated is much debated. However it is suggested that this might be related to the death of a patron of the family or the desire to move to better farmlands.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Early medieval settlements: the archaeology of rural communities in North-West Europe 400\u2013900. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2004. p105</ref>\n\nThese farms are often falsely supposed to be \"peasant farms\". However, a ''ceorl'', who was the lowest ranking freeman in early Anglo-Saxon society, was not a peasant but an arms-owning male with access to law, support of a kindred and the wergild, situated at the apex of an extended household working at least one hide of land. It is the ceorl that we should associate with the standard {{convert|8|-|10|m|abbr=off}} x {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} post-hole building of the early Anglo-Saxon period, grouped with others of the same kin group. Each such household head had a number of less-free dependants.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J. An English Empire: Bede, the Britons, and the Early Anglo-Saxon Kings. Vol 2 p244</ref>\n\nThe success of the rural world in the 5th and 6th centuries, according to the landscape archaeology, was due to three factors: the continuity with the past, with no evidence of up-rooting in the landscape; farmers' freedom and rights over lands, with provision of a rent or duty to an overlord, who provided only slight lordly input; and the common outfield arable land (of an outfield-infield system) that provided the ability to build kinship and group cultural ties.\n\n===Material culture===\nThe origins of the timber building tradition seen in early Anglo-Saxon England have generated much debate which has mirrored a wider debate about the cultural affinities of Anglo-Saxon material culture.\n[[File:Grubenhaus at Bede's World Jarrow.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|A type of Anglo-Saxon building called a Grubenhaus]]\n\n[[Philip Rahtz]] asserted that buildings seen in West Stow and Mucking had late Roman origins.<ref>Rahtz, Philip. \"Buildings and rural settlement.\" The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England 44 (1976): p 56</ref> Archaeologist Philip Dixon noted the striking similarity between Anglo-Saxon timber halls and Romano-British rural houses. The Anglo-Saxons did not import the 'long-house', the traditional dwelling of the continental Germanic peoples, to Britain. Instead they upheld a local vernacular British building tradition dating back to the late first century. This has been interpreted as evidence of the endurance of kinship and household structures from the Roman into the Anglo-Saxon period.<ref>Hodges, R. (1989) ''The Anglo-Saxon Achievement' Duckworth, London. {{ISBN|0-7156-2130-0}}, pp.&nbsp;34\u201336</ref><ref>Dixon, Philip. \"How Saxon is the Saxon house?\" Structural reconstruction. Oxford (1982).</ref>\n\nHowever, this has been considered too neat an explanation for all the evidence. Anne and Gary Marshall summarise the situation:\n<blockquote>\"One of the main problems in Anglo-Saxon archaeology has been to account for the apparent uniqueness of the English timber structures of the period. These structures seem to bear little resemblance either to earlier Romano-British or to continental models. In essence, the problem is that the hybrid Anglo-Saxon style seems to appear full-blown with no examples of development from the two potentially ancestral traditions&nbsp;\u2026 The consensus of the published work was that the Anglo-Saxon building style was predominantly home-grown.\" <ref>Marshall, Anne, and Garry Marshall. \"A survey and analysis of the buildings of Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon England.\" Medieval Archaeology 35 (1991): 29</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the [[Sutton Hoo]] burial, perhaps that of the East Anglian king [[Raedwald]], a long and complex iron chain, used for supending a cauldron from the beams of a hall, was found. It was the product of a continuous British smithing tradition dating to pre-Roman times. This was, however, a high-status object.<ref>Bruce-Mitford 1983, 511&ndash;553.</ref>\n\nFor Bryan Ward-Perkins the answer to the relative lack of native influence on everyday objects is found in the success of the Anglo-Saxon culture and highlights the micro-diversity and larger cohesion that produced a dynamic force in comparison to the Brittonic culture.<ref name=\"Ward-Perkins, Bryan 2000\"/> From beads and quoits to clothes and houses, there is something unique happening in the early Anglo-Saxon period. The material culture evidence shows that people adopted and adapted styles based on set roles and styles. John Hines, commenting on the diversity of nearly a thousand glass beads and many different clothes clasps from Lakenheath, states that these reveal a \"society where people relied on others to fulfill a role\" and \"what they had around them was making a statement\", not one about the individual, but about \"identity between small groups not within small groups\".<ref>John Hines: \"Stories from the Dark Earth: Meet the Ancestors Revisited\" Episode 4 BBC 2013</ref>\n\nJulian Richards commenting on this and other evidence suggests: \n<blockquote>\"[The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain] was more complex than a mass invasion bringing fully formed lifestyles and beliefs. The early Anglo-Saxon, just like today's migrants, were probably riding different cultural identities. They brought from their homelands the traditions of their ancestors. But they would have been trying to work out not only who they were, but who they wanted to be&nbsp;\u2026 and forge an identity for those who followed.\"<ref>Julian Richards: \"Stories from the Dark Earth: Meet the Ancestors Revisited\" Episode 4 BBC 2013</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLooking beyond simplistic 'homeland' scenarios, and explaining the observations that 'Anglo-Saxon' houses and other aspects of material culture do not find exact matches in the 'Germanic homelands' in Europe, Halsall explains the changes within the context of a larger 'North Sea interaction zone', including lowland England, Northern Gaul and northern Germany. These areas experienced marked social and cultural changes in the wake of Roman collapse\u2014experienced not only within the former Roman provinces (Gaul, Britain) but also in ''[[wiktionary:Barbaricum|Barbaricum]]'' itself. All three areas experienced changes in social structure, settlement patterns and ways of expressing identities, as well as tensions which created push and pull factors for migrations in, perhaps, multiple directions.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2011|p=35}}</ref>\n\n===Culture of belief===\nThe study of pagan religious practice in the early Anglo-Saxon period is difficult. Most of the texts that may contain relevant information are not contemporary, but written later by Christian writers who tended to have a hostile attitude to pre-Christian beliefs, and who may have distorted their portrayal of them. Much of the information used to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon paganism comes from later Scandinavian and Icelandic texts and there is a debate about how relevant these are. The study of pagan Anglo-Saxon beliefs has often been approached with reference to Roman or even Greek typologies and categories. Archaeologists therefore use such terms as gods, myths, temples, sanctuaries, priests, magic and cults. Charlotte Behr argues that this provides a worldview of Anglo-Saxon practice culture which is unhelpful.<ref>Behr, Charlotte. Review \"Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited, edited by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark & Sarah Semple, 2010. Oxford: Oxbow Books; {{ISBN|978-1-84217-395-4}}\". in Cambridge Archaeological Journal 21.02 (2011): 315\u2013316.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] employed a new method of looking at the belief systems of the fifth to seventh centuries, by arguing for a model of religion which was typified by a pick and choose approach. The period was exceptional because there was no orthodoxy or institutions to control or hinder the people. This freedom of culture is seen also in the Roman-British community and is very evident in the complaints of [[Gildas]].<ref>Brown, Peter. The Rise of Western Christendom. Oxford, 2003.</ref>\n\nOne Anglo-Saxon cultural practice that is better understood are the burial customs, due in part to archaeological excavations at various sites including [[Sutton Hoo]], [[Spong Hill]], [[Royal saxon tomb in Prittlewell|Prittlewell]], [[Snape boat grave|Snape]] and [[Walkington Wold Burials|Walkington Wold]], and the existence of around 1,200 pagan (or non-Christian) cemeteries. There was no set form of burial, with [[cremation]] being preferred in the north and [[inhumation]] in the south, although both forms were found throughout England, sometimes in the same cemeteries. When cremation did take place, the ashes were usually placed within an urn and then buried, sometimes along with [[grave goods]].<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 274.</ref> According to archaeologist Dave Wilson, \"the usual orientation for an inhumation in a pagan Anglo-Saxon cemetery was west\u2013east, with the head to the west, although there were often deviations from this.\"<ref>[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 87.</ref> Indicative of possible religious belief, grave goods were common amongst inhumation burials as well as cremations; free Anglo-Saxon men were buried with at least one weapon in the pagan tradition, often a [[seax]], but sometimes also with a [[Migration period spear|spear]], [[Migration period sword|sword]] or shield, or a combination of these.<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\"/> There are also a number of recorded cases of parts of animals being buried within such graves. Most common amongst these was body parts belonging to either [[goats]] or [[sheep]], although parts of [[oxen]] were also relatively common, and there are also isolated cases of [[goose]], [[crab apple]]s, duck eggs and [[hazelnuts]] being buried in graves. It is widely thought therefore that such items constituted a food source for the deceased.<ref>[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. pp.&nbsp;98\u2013100.</ref> In some cases, animal skulls, particularly oxen but also pig, were buried in human graves, a practice that was also found earlier in [[Roman Britain]].<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\"/>\n\nThere is also evidence for the continuation of Christianity in south and east Britain. The Christian shrine at St Albans and its martyr cult survived throughout the period ([[#Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae|see Gildas above]]). There are references in Anglo-Saxon poetry, including Beowulf, that show some interaction between pagan and Christian practices and values. While there is little scholarly focus on this subject, there is enough evidence from Gildas and elsewhere that it is safe to assume some continuing \u2013 perhaps more free \u2013 form of Christianity survived. Richard Whinder states \"(The Church's pre-Augustine) characteristics place it in continuity with the rest of the Christian Church in Europe at that time and, indeed, in continuity with the Catholic faith&nbsp;... today.\" <ref>Whinder, R, Christianity in Britain before St Augustine Catholic History Society 2008</ref>\n     \nThe complexity of belief, indicated by various pieces of evidence, is disturbing to those looking for easy categories. The extent to which belief was discursive and free during the settlement period suggests a lack of proscription, indeed, this might be a characteristic of Anglo-Saxon cultural success.\n\n===Language and literature===\nLittle is known about the everyday spoken language of people living in the migration period. Old English is a [[Language contact|contact language]] and  reconstructing the [[pidgin]] used in this period from the written language found in the West Saxon literature of some 400 years later is difficult. Two general theories are proposed regarding why people changed their language to Old English (or an early form of such); either a person or household changed so as to serve an elite, or a person or household changed through choice as it provided some advantage economically or legally.<ref>Killie, Kristin. \"Old English\u2013Late British language contact and the English progressive.\" Language Contact and Development Around the North Sea 321 (2012): p119</ref>\n\nAccording to Nick Higham, the adoption of the language\u2014as well as the material culture and traditions\u2014of an Anglo-Saxon elite, \"by large numbers of the local people seeking to improve their status within the social structure, and undertaking for this purpose rigorous acculturation\", is the key to understanding the transition from Romano-British to Anglo-Saxon. The progressive nature of this language acquisition, and the 'retrospective reworking' of kinship ties to the dominant group led, ultimately, to the \"myths which tied the entire society to immigration as an explanation of their origins in Britain\".<ref>Higham, N. 1992. Rome, Britain and the Anglo-Saxons. Guildford: Seaby p&nbsp;229\u2013230</ref>\n \nThe final few lines of the poem \"[[Battle of Brunanburh (poem)|The Battle of Brunanburh]]\", a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon poem that celebrates a victory of [[\u00c6thelstan]], the first king of all the English, give a poetic voice to the English conception of their origins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old-English poem The Battle of Brunanburh along with translations and background information|url=http://loki.stockton.edu/~kinsellt/litresources/brun/brun2.html#astext}}</ref>\n \n{| cellpadding=\"6\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:50%;\" |'''''Old English'''''\n| style=\"width:50%;\" |'''''Modern English'''''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n''...Engle and Seaxe upp becomon,<br/>\n''ofer brad brimu Britene sohton, <br/>\n''wlance wig-smithas, Wealas ofercomon,<br/>\n''eorlas ar-hwaete eard begeaton.<br/>\n|\n...Angles and Saxons came up <br/>\nover the broad sea. Britain they sought,<br/>\nProud war-smiths who overcame the Welsh,<br/>\nglorious warriors they took hold of the land. <br/>\n|}\n\nThis 'heroic tradition' of conquering incomers is consistent with the conviction of [[Bede]], and later Anglo-Saxon historians, that the ancestral origin of the English was not the result of any assimilation with the native British, but was derived solely from the Germanic migrants of the post-Roman period. It also explains the enduring appeal of poems and heroic stories such as [[Beowulf]], [[Wulf and Eadwacer]] and [[Judith (poem)|Judith]], well into the Christian period. The success of the language is the most obvious result of the settlement period. This language was not just the language of acculturation, but through its stories, poetry and oral traditions became the agency of change.<ref>Harris, Stephen (2003) ''Race and Ethnicity in Anglo-Saxon Literature'' Routledge, DOIhttps://doi.org/10.4324/9780203497999, eBook {{ISBN|9781135924379}}</ref>\n\nNick Higham has provided this summary of the processes:\n<blockquote>\"As Bede later implied, language was a key indicator of ethnicity in early England. In circumstances where freedom at law, acceptance with the kindred, access to patronage, and the use or possession of weapons were all exclusive to those who could claim Germanic descent, then speaking Old English without Latin or Brittonic inflection had considerable value.\"<ref>Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J.

It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic-speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, eventually developed a common [[cultural identity]] as [[Anglo-Saxons]]. This process occurred from the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman rule in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scant contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre, and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on [[Old English]]. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians and archaeologists until the mid- to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants. If this traditional viewpoint were to be correct, the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\nAnother view, which gained popularity at the end of the 20th century, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centered on a warrior elite. This hypothesis suggests that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, initiated a process of [[acculturation]] by the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though  there were marked changes in material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The theory has been criticized by many linguists on the grounds that a complete shift in the language, culture, and place names of England would be impossible with a numerically insignificant immigrant population.\n\nA third view, possibly the most widely held today, posits that a genuine large-scale folk migration of Germanic peoples did occur, but rejects the notion that all of the Romano-Britons were forcefully and deliberately exterminated. In this view, the Anglo-Saxon settlement spanned several centuries and did not involve an extended period of violence; rather, some Britons migrated west, others settled in [[Armorica]], and still others remained living alongside the Anglo-Saxons, but for one reason or another came to adopt their culture and language.\n\nGenetic tests of the English population have produced uncertain, and at times contradictory, results.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}\n\n[[File:End.of.Roman.rule.in.Britain.383.410.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Britain, 383\u2013410{{efn|Based on Jones & Mattingly's Atlas of Roman Britain ({{ISBN|978-1-84217-067-0}}, 1990, reprinted 2007); Mattingly's Imperial Possession ({{ISBN|978-0-14-014822-0}}, 2006); Higham's Rome, Britain, and the Anglo-Saxons ({{ISBN|1-85264-022-7}}, 1992); Frere's Britannia ({{ISBN|0-7102-1215-1}}, 1987); and Snyder's An Age of Tyrants ({{ISBN|978-0-631-22260-6}}) \u2014 the sources are cited in the image legend \u2014 Locations of towns (fortified and unfortified) are given on p. 156, with tribal civitates and coloniae specified on p. 154, of Atlas of Roman Britain.

That cycle of loss and recapture collapsed over the next decade. Eventually, around 410, although Roman power remained a force to be reckoned with for a further three generations across much of [[Gaul]], Britain slipped beyond direct imperial control into a phase which has generally been termed \"sub-Roman\".<ref>P. Salway, Roman Britain (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1981), pp. 295\u2013311, 318, 322, 349, 356, 380, 401\u20135</ref>\n\nThe history of this period has traditionally been a narrative of decline and fall. However, evidence from [[Verulamium]] suggests that urban-type rebuilding,<ref>S. S. Frere, Verulamium Excavations, II (London, Society of Antiquaries, 1983).</ref> featuring piped water, was continuing late on in the fifth century, if not beyond.

Pohl (Leiden, Brill, 2003), pp. 362\u20133</ref>\n\nThe writing of Patrick and Gildas (see below) demonstrates the survival in Britain of Latin literacy and Roman education, learning and law within elite society and Christianity, throughout the bulk of the fifth and sixth centuries. Also, signs in Gildas' works indicate that the economy was thriving without Roman taxation, as he complains of ''luxuria'' and self-indulgence. In the mid fifth century, Anglo-Saxons begin to appear in an apparently still functionally Romanised Britain.<ref>A. B. E. Hood (ed. and trans.), St. Patrick: His Writings and Muirchu's Life (Chichester, Phillimore, 1978); M. Winterbottom (ed. and trans.), Gildas: The Ruin of Britain and other works (Chichester, Phillimore, 1978). Neither text is securely dated, but both are clearly post-Roman and Patrick at least is generally assumed to be a fifth-century author. For the dating of Gildas, see variously D. N. Dumville ''The Chronology of De Excidio Britanniae, Book I'', in ''Gildas: New Approaches'', eds M. Lapidge and D. N. Dumville (Woodbridge, Boydell and Brewer, 1984), pp. 61\u201384; [[N. J.

These tyrants dominate the historical accounts of the fifth and sixth centuries and the work tells us much about the transition from magisterial to monarchical power in Britain.}}<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|1998}}, ''Age of Tyrants''.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of events in Gildas is:<ref>Winterbottom, M. (1978), De Excidio britanniae, Chichester The standard modern edition and translation.</ref>\n# After an appeal to [[Flavius Aetius|A\u00ebtius]] (the [[Groans of the Britons]]) the Britons were gripped by famine while suffering attacks from the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]]; some fought back successfully, leading to a period of peace.\n# Peace led to ''luxuria'' and self-indulgence.\n# A renewed attack was threatened by the Picts and Scoti, and this led to a council, where it was proposed and agreed that land in the east would be given to the Saxons on the basis of a treaty, a ''foedus'', by which the Saxons would defend the Britons in exchange for food supplies. This type of arrangement was unexceptional in a Late Roman context; Franks had been settled as ''foederati'' on imperial territory in northern Gaul ([[Toxandria]]) in the fourth century, and the [[Visigoths]] were settled in [[Gallia Aquitania]] early in the fifth century. \n#The Saxon ''foederati'' first complained that their monthly supplies were inadequate. Then they threatened to break the treaty, which they did, spreading the onslaught \"from sea to sea\".\n# This war, which Higham called the \"War of the Saxon Federates\", ended some 20\u201330 years later, shortly after the [[Battle of Badon|siege at Mons Badonicus]], and some 40 years before Gildas was born.{{Efn|The phrase which mentions 40 years has been subject of much scholarly discussion.

The \"divorce settlement\", Higham in particular has argued, was a worse treaty from the British viewpoint. This included the payment of tribute to the people in the east (i.e. the Saxons), who were under the leadership of the person Gildas called ''pater diabolus''.<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 1995\">{{cite book |last=Higham |first=Nick | authorlink=N.

The historical details are, as Snyder had it: \"by-products from his recounting of royal-sins\".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|1998|p=85}}</ref> There is a strong tradition of Christian writers who were concerned with the moral qualities of leadership and Gildas joined these. He used apocalyptic language: for example the Saxons were \"villains\", \"enemies\", led by a Devil-father. Yet, Gildas had lived through, in his own words, an age of \"external peace\", and it is this peace that brought with it the ''tyrannis''\u2014\"unjust rule\".\n\nGildas' remarks reflected his continuing concern regarding the vulnerability of his countrymen and their disregard and in-fighting: for example, \"it was always true of this people (as it is now) that it was weak in beating off the weapons of the enemy, but strong in putting up with civil war and the burden of sin.\"<ref>De Excidio XXI, 1, Winterbottom, Gildas, p. 24.</ref> However, after the War of the Saxon Federates, if there were acts of genocide, mass exodus, or mass slavery, Gildas did not seem to know about them. Gildas, in discussing the holy shrines, mentioned that the spiritual life of Britain had suffered, because the partition (''divortium''), of the country, which was preventing the citizens (''cives'') from worshipping at the shrines of the martyrs. Control had been ceded to the Saxons, even control of access to such shrines.

The '''Saint Petersburg Bede''' (Saint Petersburg, [[Russian National Library|National Library of Russia]], lat. Q. v. I. 18), a near-contemporary version of the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'']]\n\nGildas and other sources were used by Bede in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', written around 731. Bede identifies the migrants as Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, reporting (Bk I, Ch 15) that the Saxons came from [[Old Saxony]] (Northern Germany) and the Angles from 'Anglia', which lay between the homelands of the Saxons and Jutes.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1843a|pp=72\u201373}}, Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', Bk I, Ch 15.</ref> Anglia is reasonably taken to be the old [[Schleswig-Holstein Province]] (straddling the modern [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Germany|German]] border), and containing the modern [[Angeln]]. Jutland was the homeland of the Jutes, and the coast between the [[Elbe River|Elbe]] and [[Weser River|Weser]] rivers (modern German state of Lower Saxony) is the Saxon area of origin.\n\nCrucially, Bede seems to identify three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial, as implied by the statement that ''Anglus'' was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.<ref>Brugmann, B. I. R. T. E. \"Migration and endogenous change.\" The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology (2011): 30\u201345.</ref> This analysis of Bede has led to a re-evaluation, in terms of continuity and change, of Bede's \"Northumbrian\" view of history and how this view was projected back into the account of the latter two phases of settlement; and a possible overhaul of the traditional chronological framework.\n\nThe concept of [[Bretwalda]] originates in Bede's comment on who held the Imperium of Britain.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1843a|pp=72\u201373}}, Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', Bk 2, Ch 5.</ref> From this concept, historians have inferred a formal institution of overlordship south of the Humber. Whether such an institution existed is uncertain, but [[Simon Keynes]] argues that the idea is not an invented concept.<ref name=\"Keynes, Simon 1995\">Keynes, Simon. \"England, 700\u2013900.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History 2 (1995): 18\u201342.</ref> The Bretwalda concept is taken as evidence for a presence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families. Whether the majority were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage, were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture, is unclear, but the balance of opinion is that most were migrants. Notable gaps include: no-one from the East or West Midlands is represented in the list of Bretwaldas, and  some uncertainty exists about the dates of these leaders.\n\nBede's view of Britons is partly responsible for the picture of them as the downtrodden subjects of Anglo-Saxon oppression. This has been used by some linguists and archaeologists to produce invasion and settlement theories involving genocide, [[Ethnic cleansing|forced migration]] and enslavement.<ref>See Coates 2007 for such a view, which is made to fit with Bede's narrative</ref> Bede's depiction of the Britons was probably influenced by what he had read in Gildas, which had  depicted Saxon incursions as punishment from God. Bede's use of ethnic terminology has been questioned, with Windy McKinney observing that it was \"tied to the expression of tradition and religious ideas, to the loyalty of a people to authority, and subject to change as history continued to unfold. Therefore, it is a moot point whether all of those whom Bede encompassed under the term Angli were racially Germanic\".<ref>McKinney, Windy A. \"Creating a gens Anglorum: Social and Ethnic Identity in Anglo-Saxon England through the Lens of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica.\" (2011).</ref> Indeed, Bede himself may not have been an ethnically 'pure' Angle.<ref>[[N. J. Higham|Nicholas Higham]], The Kingdom of Northumbria: AD 350\u20131100. Stroud: Alan Sutton Publishing, Inc., 1993. p75</ref>\n\n===Tribal Hideage===\nThe [[Tribal Hidage|''Tribal Hideage'']] is a list of 35 tribes that was compiled in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] some time between the seventh and ninth centuries. The inclusion of the 'Elmet-dwellers' suggests to Simon Keynes that the Tribal Hideage was compiled in the early 670s, during the reign of King Wulfhere, since Elmet seems to have reverted thereafter to Northumbrian control.<ref name=\"Keynes, Simon 1995\"/>\n\nIt includes a number of independent kingdoms and other smaller territories and assigns a number of [[hide (unit)|hides]] to each one. A hide was an amount of land sufficient to support a household. The list of tribes is headed by [[Mercia]] and consists almost exclusively of peoples who lived south of the [[Humber]] estuary and territories that surrounded the Mercian kingdom, some of which have never been satisfactorily identified by scholars. The document is problematic, but extremely important for historians, as it provides a glimpse into the relationship between people, land, and the tribes and groups into which they had organised themselves.\n\nThe individual units in the list developed from the settlement areas of tribal groups, some of which are as little as 300 hides. The names are difficult to locate: places such as ''East wixna'' and ''Sweord ora''. What it reveals is that micro-identity of tribe and family is important from the start. The list is evidence for more complex settlement than the single political entity of the other historical sources.<ref>Davies, Wendy & Hayo Vierck \u2013 The Contexts of the Tribal Hidage: Social Aggregates and Settlement Patterns, Fr\u00fchmittelalterliche Studien 8, 1974</ref>\n\n===''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' is a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England, which was kept from the late 9th to the mid-12th century. The chronicle is a collection of annals that were still being updated in some cases more than 600 years after the events they describe. They contain various entries that seem to add to the breadth of the historical evidence and provide good evidence for a migration, the Anglo-Saxon elites, and various significant historical events.\n\nThe earliest events described in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' were transcribed centuries after they had occurred. [[Barbara Yorke]], Patrick Sims-Williams, and [[David Dumville]], among others, have highlighted how a number of features of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the fifth and early sixth centuries clearly contradict the idea that they contain a reliable year-by-year record.<ref>Dumville, D.N. (1986) 'The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List: manuscripts and texts', in Anglia 104, 1\u201332</ref> Stuart Laycock has suggested that some information describing the early period may be accepted as containing a kernel of truth if the obvious glosses and fictions are rejected (such as the information about Porta and Portsmouth). The sequence of the events associated with [[\u00c6lle of Sussex]] seems plausible, whilst the dates are uncertain.<ref name=\"Laycock, Stuart 2012\">Laycock, Stuart. Britannia-The Failed State: Tribal Conflict and the End of Roman Britain. History Press, 2012.</ref> However, presenting evidence for the Anglo-Saxon settlement from a chronicle such as the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' is uncertain and relies heavily on the present view of which entries are acceptable truth. As Dumville points out about the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'': \"medieval historiography has assumptions different from our own, particularly in terms of distinctions between fiction and non-fiction\".<ref>Kooper, Erik, ed.

An Anglo-Saxon elite could be formed in two ways: from an incoming chieftain and his war band from northern [[Germania]] taking over an area of Britain, or through a native British chieftain and his war band adopting Anglo-Saxon culture and language.<ref name=\"Myres, J.N.L. 1989 pp. 146\">Myres, J.N.L.

However the archaeology of the peasant from the 4th and 5th centuries is dominated by \"ladder\" field systems or enclosures, associated with extended families, and in the South and East of England the extensive use of timber-built buildings and farmsteads shows a lower level of engagement with Roman building methods than is shown by the houses of the numerically much smaller elite.<ref>Hingley, Rural Settlements in Roman Britain 1989</ref>\n\n===Settler evidence===\n[[File:Mucking DSCF9230.JPG|thumb|Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon belt fittings in the [[Quoit Brooch Style]] from the [[Mucking excavation|Mucking Anglo-Saxon cemetery]], early 5th century, using a mainly Roman style for very early Anglo-Saxon clients]]\nConfirmation of the use of Anglo-Saxons as ''[[foederati]]'' or federate troops has been seen as coming from burials of Anglo-Saxons wearing military equipment of a type issued to late Roman forces, which have been found both in late Roman contexts, such as the Roman cemeteries of Winchester and Colchester, and in purely 'Anglo-Saxon' rural cemeteries like [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]] (Essex),<ref>Jones, M U 1980: 'Mucking and Early Saxon rural settlement in Essex.'

London</ref> The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, but we should not assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later [[Viking settlement of Britain|Viking settlers]], may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by [[Sonia Chadwick Hawkes]] as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.<ref>Hawkes, S Chadwick 1982: 'Anglo-Saxon Kent c 425\u2013725.'

Beyond these, in the early Anglo-Saxon period, identity was local: although people would have known their neighbours, it may have been important to indicate tribal loyalty with details of clothing and especially fasteners.<ref>Hills, Catherine. \"Overview: Anglo-Saxon identity.\" The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology (2011): 3\u201312.</ref> It is also unlikely that people would have thought of themselves as Anglo-Saxon: instead they were part of a tribe or region, descendants of a patron or followers of a leader. It is this identity that archaeological evidence seeks to understand and determine, considering how it might support separate identity groups, or identities that were inter-connected.<ref>Brooks, Nicholas. \"The formation of the Mercian Kingdom\", The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms (1989): 159\u2013170.</ref>\n\nPart of a well-furnished pagan-period mixed inhumation-and-cremation cemetery was excavated at [[Alwalton]] near Peterborough. Twenty-eight urned and two unurned cremations dating from between the 5th and 6th centuries, and 34 inhumations, dating from between the late 5th and early 7th centuries, were uncovered. Both cremations and inhumations were provided with pyre or grave goods, and some of the burials were richly furnished. The excavation found evidence for a mixture of practices and symbolic clothing; these reflected local differences that appeared to be associated with tribal or family loyalty. This use of clothing in particular was very symbolic, and distinct differences within groups in the cemetery could be found.<ref>Gibson, C. 2007.

Oxford: Oxford University School of Archaeology.</ref>\n\n===Reuse of earlier monuments===\nThe evidence for monument reuse in the early Anglo-Saxon period reveals a number of significant aspects of the practice. Ancient monuments were one of the most important factors determining the placing of the dead in the early Anglo-Saxon landscape. Anglo-Saxon secondary activity on prehistoric and Roman sites was traditionally explained in practical terms. These explanations, in the view of Howard Williams, failed to account for the numbers and types of monuments and graves (from villas to barrows) reused.<ref name=\"Williams, Howard 1997\">Williams, Howard. \"Ancient Landscapes and the Dead: The Reuse of Prehistoric and Roman Monuments as Early Anglo-Saxon Burial Sites.\" (1997).</ref>\n\nAnglo-Saxon barrow burials started in the late 6th century and continued into the early 8th century. Prehistoric barrows, in particular, have been seen as physical expressions of land claims and links to the ancestors, and John Shephard has extended this interpretation to Anglo-Saxon tumuli.<ref>Shephard, J 1979, 'The social identity of the individual in isolated barrows and barrow cemeteries in Anglo-Saxon England', in B C Burnham and J Kingsbury (eds), Space, Hierarchy and Society, Brit Archaeol Rep Int Ser 59, 47\u201379.</ref> Eva Th\u00e4te has emphasised the continental origins of monument reuse in post-Roman England,<ref>Th\u00e4te, E 1996, 'Alte Denkm\u00e4ler und fr\u00fchgeschichtliche Bestattungen: Ein s\u00e4chsisch-angels\u00e4chsischer Totenbrauch und seine Kontinuit\u00e4t', Arch\u00e4ol Inf 19, 105\u201316</ref> Howard Williams has suggested that the main purpose of this custom was to give sense to a landscape that the immigrants did not find empty.<ref name=\"Williams, Howard 1997\"/>\n\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, monument reuse became so widespread that it strongly suggests the deliberate location of burials of the elite next to visible monuments of the pre-Saxon past, but with 'ordinary' burial grounds of this phase also frequently being located next to prehistoric barrows. The relative increase of this kind of spatial association from the 5th/6th centuries to the 7th/8th centuries is conspicuous. Williams' analysis of two well-documented samples shows an increase from 32% to 50% of Anglo-Saxon burial sites in the Upper Thames region, and from 47% to 71% of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries excavated since 1945. H\u00e4rke suggests that one of the contexts for the increasing reuse of monuments may be \"the adoption by the natives of the material culture of the dominant immigrants\".<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\">{{cite journal |last=H\u00e4rke |first=Heinrich |title=Anglo-Saxon Immigration and Ethnogenesis |journal=Medieval Archaeology |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=1\u201328 |doi=10.1179/174581711X13103897378311}}</ref>\n\n===Landscape archaeology===\nThe Anglo-Saxons did not settle in an abandoned landscape on which they imposed new types of settlement and farming, as was once believed. By the late 4th century the English rural landscape was largely cleared and generally occupied by dispersed farms and hamlets, each surrounded by its own fields but often sharing other resources in common (called \"infield-outfield cultivation\").<ref>Taylor, Christopher. Village and farmstead: a history of rural settlement in England. G. Philip, 1983: 83\u2013106</ref> Such fields, whether of prehistoric or Roman origin, fall into two very general types, found both separately and together: irregular layouts, in which one field after another had been added to an arable hub over many centuries; and regular rectilinear layouts, often roughly following the local topography, that had resulted from the large-scale division of considerable areas of land. Such stability was reversed within a few decades of the 5th century, as early \"Anglo-Saxon\" farmers, affected both by the collapse of Roman Britain and a climatic deterioration which reached its peak probably around 500, concentrated on subsistence, converting to pasture large areas of previously ploughed land. However, there is little evidence of abandoned arable land.\n\nEvidence across southern and central England increasingly shows the persistence of prehistoric and Roman field layouts into and, in some cases throughout, the Anglo-Saxon period, whether or not such fields were continuously ploughed. Landscapes at Yarnton, Oxfordshire, and Mucking, Essex, remained unchanged throughout the 5th century, while at Barton Court, Oxfordshire, the 'grid of ditched paddocks or closes' of a Roman villa estate formed a general framework for the Anglo-Saxon settlement there.<ref>Hammerow, H. Early Medieval Settlements: The Archaeology of Rural Communities in North-West Europe, 400\u2013900. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> Similar evidence has been found at Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire.<ref>Hamerow et al. 2007: 'Anglo-Saxon settlement near Drayton Road, SuttonCourtenay, Berkshire'.

Tradition and Transformation in Anglo-Saxon England: Archaeology, Common Rights and Landscape. Bloomsbury Academic, 2013.</ref> in particular, the open field systems, shared between a number of cultivators but cropped individually; the link between arable holdings and rights to common pasture land; in structures of governance and the duty to pay some of the surplus to the local overlord, whether in rent or duty. Together these reveal that kinship ties and social relations were continuous across the 5th and 6th centuries, with no evidence of the uniformity or destruction, imposed by lords, the savage action of invaders or system collapse. This has implications on how later developments are considered, such as the developments in the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nLandscape studies draw upon a variety of topographical, archaeological and written sources. There are major problems in trying to relate Anglo-Saxon charter boundaries to those of Roman estates for which there are no written records, and by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period there had been major changes to the organisation of the landscape which can obscure earlier arrangements.<ref>Hall, D 1988: 'The late Saxon countryside: villages and their fields.' Hooke (ed) 1988, 99\u2013122</ref> Interpretation is also hindered by uncertainty about late Roman administrative arrangements. Nevertheless, studies carried out throughout the country, in \"British\" as well as \"Anglo-Saxon\" areas, have found examples of continuity of territorial boundaries where, for instance, Roman villa estate boundaries seem to have been identical with those of medieval estates, as delineated in early charters, though settlement sites within the defined territory might shift.<ref>Rodwell, W J and Rodwell, K A 1985: Rivenhall: Investigations of a Villa, Church and Village, 1950\u20131977.</ref> What we see in these examples is probably continuity of the estate or territory as a unit of administration rather than one of exploitation.<ref>Rippon, Stephen, et al. \"The Fields of Britannia: Continuity and Discontinuity in the Pays and Regions of Roman Britain.\" Landscapes 14.1 (2013): 33\u201353.</ref> Although the upper level of Roman administration based on towns seems to have disappeared during the 5th century, a subsidiary system based on subdivisions of the countryside may have continued.<ref>Foard, G 1985: 'The administrative organization of Northamptonshire in the Saxon period.' Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History 4, 185\u2013222</ref>\n\nThe basis of the internal organisation of both the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and those of their Celtic neighbours was a large rural territory which contained a number of subsidiary settlements dependent upon a central residence which the Anglo-Saxons called a ''villa'' in Latin and a ''t\u016bn'' in Old English. These developments suggest that the basic infrastructure of the early Anglo-Saxon local administration (or the settlement of early kings or earls) was inherited from late Roman or [[Sub-Roman Britain]].<ref>Wareham, Andrew. Lords and communities in early medieval East Anglia. Boydell Press, 2005</ref>\n\n===Distribution of settlements===\nThere are a number of difficulties in recognising early Anglo-Saxon settlements as migrant settlers. This in part is because most early rural Anglo-Saxon sites have yielded few finds other than pottery and bone. The use of aerial photography does not yield easily identifiable settlements, partly due to the dispersed nature of many of these settlements.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2011. p119-124\">Hamerow, Helena, David A. Hinton, and Sally Crawford, eds. The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology. OUP Oxford, 2011. p&nbsp;119\u2013124</ref>\n\nThe distribution of known settlements also remains elusive with few settlements found in the West Midlands or North-West. Even in Kent, an area of rich early Anglo-Saxon archaeology, the number of excavated settlements is fewer than expected. However, in contrast the counties of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire are relatively rich in early settlements. These have revealed a tendency for early Anglo-Saxon settlements to be on the light soils associated with river terraces.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2011. p119-124\"/>\n\nMany of the inland settlements are on rivers that had been major navigation routes during the Roman era.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=199}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''. The major inland navigation routes are shown.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Zaluckyj|2001|p=13}}, ''Mercia'', \"Mercia: The Beginnings\", by Sarah Zaluckyj. Zaluckyj states that the Angles travelled up river valleys, specifically mentioning the Trent and Nene.</ref> These sites, such as [[Dorchester on Thames]] on the upper [[River Thames|Thames]],  were readily accessible by the shallow-draught, [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] boats used by the Anglo-Saxons. The same is true of the settlements along the rivers [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]], [[River Trent|Trent]], [[River Witham|Witham]], [[River Nene|Nene]] and along the marshy lower Thames. Less well known due to a dearth of physical evidence but attested by surviving place names, there were Jutish settlements on the [[Isle of Wight]] and the nearby southern coast of  [[Hampshire]].\n\nA number of Anglo-Saxon settlements are located near or at Roman-era towns, but the question of simultaneous town occupation by the Romano-Britons and a nearby Anglo-Saxon settlement (i.e., suggesting a relationship) is not confirmed. At [[Venta Icenorum|Roman Caistor-by-Norwich]], for example, recent analysis suggests that the cemetery post-dates the town's virtual abandonment.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Russo|1998|p=71}}, ''Town Origins and Development in Early England''.</ref>\n\n===Cemetery evidence===\n[[File:Britain.5th.cen.AS.cemeteries.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Early cemeteries of possible Settler origin]]\nThe earliest cemeteries that can be classified as Anglo-Saxon are found in widely separate regions and are dated to the early 5th century.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=317}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''</ref> The exception is in [[Kent]], where the density of cemeteries and artefacts suggest either an exceptionally heavy Anglo-Saxon settlement, or continued settlement beginning at an early date, or both. By the late 5th century there were additional Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, some of them adjacent to earlier ones, but with a large expansion in other areas, and now including the southern coast of [[Sussex]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|p=318}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain''</ref>\n\nUp to the year 2000, roughly 10,000 early 'Anglo-Saxon' cremations and inhumations had been found, exhibiting a large degree of diversity in styles and types of mortuary ritual.<ref>Lucy, Sam. The Anglo-Saxon way of death: burial rites in early England. Sutton Publishing, 2000.</ref> This is consistent with evidence for many micro cultures and local practice. Cemetery evidence is still dominated by the material culture: finds of clothes, jewellery, weapons, pots and personal items; but physical and molecular evidence from skeletons, bones and teeth are increasingly important.\n \nConsidering the early cemeteries of Kent, most relevant finds come from furnished graves with distinctive links to the Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches,<ref name=\"Suzuki, Seiichi 2000\">Suzuki, Seiichi. The quoit brooch style and Anglo-Saxon settlement: a casting and recasting of cultural identity symbols. Boydell & Brewer, 2000.</ref> an important element of female dress that functioned as a fastener, rather like a modern safety pin. The style of brooches (called [[Quoit (brooch)|Quoits]]), is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its design organisation, and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as part of the process of construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society.

Given the lower average stature of Britons, the most likely explanation would be a gradual Saxonisation or Anglicisation of the material culture of native enclaves, an increasing assimilation of native populations into Anglo-Saxon communities, and increasing intermarriage between immigrants and natives within Anglo-Saxon populations. Skeletal material from the Late Roman and Early Anglo-Saxon period from Hampshire was directly compared. It was concluded that the physical type represented in urban Roman burials, was not annihilated nor did it die-out, but it continued to be well represented in subsequent burials of Anglo-Saxon date.<ref>Arnold, C J 1984, Roman Britain to Saxon England, London: Croom Helm., 130</ref>\n\nAt Stretton-on-Fosse II (Warwickshire), located on the western fringes of the early Anglo-Saxon settlement area, the proportion of male adults with weapons is 82%, well above the average in southern England. Cemetery II, the Anglo-Saxon burial site, is immediately adjacent to two Romano-British cemeteries, Stretton-on-Fosse I and III, the latter only {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} away from Anglo-Saxon burials. Continuity of the native female population at this site has been inferred from the continuity of textile techniques (unusual in the transition from the Romano-British to the Anglo-Saxon periods), and by the continuity of epigenetic traits from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon burials. At the same time, the skeletal evidence demonstrates the appearance in the post-Roman period of a new physical type of males who are more slender and taller than the men in the adjacent Romano-British cemeteries.<ref>Ford, W J 2002, 'The Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon settlement and cemeteries at Stretton on-Fosse, Warwickshire', Trans Birmingham Warwickshire Archaeol Soc 106, 1\u2013115.</ref> Taken together, the observations suggest the influx of a group of males, probably most or all of them Germanic, who took control of the local community and married native women. It is not easy to confirm such cases of 'warband' settlement in the absence of detailed skeletal, and other complementary, information, but assuming that such cases are indicated by very high proportions of weapon burials, this type of settlement was much less frequent than the kin group model.<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\"/>\n\nNick Higham outlines the main questions: \n<blockquote>\"It is fairly clear that most Anglo-Saxon cemeteries are unrepresentative of the whole population, and particularly the whole age range. This was, therefore, a community which made decisions about the disposal of the dead based upon various factors, but at those we can barely guess. Was the inclusion of some but not all individuals subject to political control, or cultural screening? Was this a mark of ethnicity or did it represent a particular kinship, real or constructed, or the adherents of a particular cult? Was it status specific, with the rural proletariat \u2013 who would have been the vast majority of the population \u2013 perhaps excluded? So are many of these cemeteries associated with specific, high-status households and weighted particularly towards adult members? We do not know, but the commitment of particular parts of the community to an imported and in some senses 'Germanic', cremation ritual does seem to have been considerable, and is something which requires explanation.\"<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 2004\">Higham, Nick. \"From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages.\" History Compass 2.1 (2004).</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Molecular evidence==\nResearchers have employed various forms of molecular evidence to investigate the relative importance of immigration, the acculturation of natives and inter-marriage in the creation of Anglo-Saxon England.\n\n===Y-chromosome evidence===\nThe inheritance of DNA is a complex process that varies between male and female individuals. Consequently, this allows the study of separate female and male lineages using mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA, respectively.<ref>Renfrew, C. & Bahn, P. 2008. Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice. London: Thames & Hudson p. 464</ref> Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA for short) and Y-chromosome DNA differ from the DNA of diploid nuclear chromosomes in that they are not formed from the combination of both parents' genes. Rather, males inherit the Y-chromosome directly from their fathers, and both sexes inherit mtDNA directly from their mothers. Consequently, they preserve a genetic record from individual to individual that is altered only through mutation. \n[[File:Weal.png|upright=1.45|thumb|right|Map of Y-chromosome distribution from data derived from \"Y chromosome evidence for Anglo-Saxon mass migration\" by Weale ''et al.''

Friesland was selected for the study due to it being regarded as a source location for Anglo-Saxon migrants, and because of the similarities between Old English and Frisian. Samples from Norway were also compared, as this is a source of the later [[Viking invasion of Britain|Viking migrations]]. The research published in 2003 found that in England 50% to 100% of paternal genetic inheritance was derived from incomers originating in the Germanic coastlands of the North Sea.<ref>Weale, M.E et al.

This study suggested that in most of England, continental (North German and Danish) paternal genetic input varied between 20% and 40%, with York forming an outlier at about 60%. Southern England, including Kent, had markedly lower frequencies of non-indigenous Y-chromosome markers than eastern England, where Danish Viking settlement is attested. However, the study could not distinguish between North German and Danish populations, thus the relative proportions of genetic input derived from the Anglo-Saxon settlements and later Danish Viking colonisation could not be ascertained.<ref>Capelli, C. et al.

Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the genetic map than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the [[Belgae]] and other continental people \u2013 and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons \u2013 arrived earlier and were already strong in the 5th century in particular regions or areas.<ref name=\"oppenheimer\">Oppenheimer, Stephen (2006).

He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the [[Basque people]] of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]], from 90% in [[Wales]] to 66% in [[East Anglia]].{{r|oppenheimer}} Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow \u2013 one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe \u2013 which occurred just after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].{{r|oppenheimer}} [[Bryan Sykes]], a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called ''Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History'', published in the United States and Canada as ''Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland''. Many feasible scenarios can be constructed to account for evidence. However, Y-chromosome evidence relies on the archaeological and historical evidence for interpretation, and there is a danger of creating a circular argument. Therefore, scenarios that are not justified by other evidence or are created to account for the historical evidence have not been universally accepted.\n\n=== Ancient DNA, rare alleles and whole genome sequencing ===\n====Modern population studies====\nA major study in 2015 by Leslie et al. on the fine scale genetic structure of the British population revealed a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography in the British Isles, showing clear signals of historical demographic events. Based on two separate analyses, the study found clear evidence in modern England of the Anglo-Saxon migration and identified the regions not carrying genetic material from these migrations, but with each analysis limiting the proportion of Saxon ancestry and clearly excluding the possibility of long-term Saxon replacement. The proportion of Saxon ancestry in Central/Southern England was found to be very likely under 50%, and most likely in the range 10%\u201340%. Additionally, in the 'non-Saxon' parts of the UK there was found to exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general 'Celtic' population.<ref>Leslie et al. (2015) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632200/ The fine scale genetic structure of the British population]</ref>\n\n====Ancient DNA studies====\nIn 2016, through the investigation of burials using ancient DNA techniques, researchers found evidence of intermarriage and mixed ancestry in the earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement. The highest status grave of the burials investigated, as evidenced by the associated goods, was that of a female of local, British, origins. It is notable that people of native, immigrant and mixed  ancestry were buried in the same cemetery, with grave goods from the same material culture, without any discernable distinction. The authors remark that their results run contrary to previous theories that have postulated strict reproductive segregation between natives and incomers. By studying rare alleles and employing whole genome sequencing, it was claimed that the continental and insular origins of the ancient remains could be discriminated, and it was calculated that a range of 25\u201340% of the ancestry of modern Britons is attributable to continental 'Anglo-Saxon' origins. The breakdown of the estimates given in this work into the modern populations of Britain determined that the population of eastern England is consistent with 38% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, with a large spread from 25 to 50%, and the Welsh and Scottish samples are consistent with 30% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, again with a large spread. The study also found that there is a small but significant difference between the mean values in the three modern British sample groups, with East English samples sharing slightly more alleles with the Dutch, and Scottish samples looking more like the Iron Age (Celtic) samples.<ref>{{Cite news|title = English DNA 'one-third' Anglo-Saxon \u2013 BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35344663|access-date = 2016-02-17|language = en-GB|date = 2016-01-19|last1 = Rincon|first1 = Paul}}</ref><ref>Schiffels, S.

However, the number of studies is small. Strontium data in a 5th\u20137th-century cemetery in [[West Heslerton]] implied the presence of two groups: one of \"local\" and one of \"nonlocal\" origin. Although the study suggested that they could not define the limits of local variation and identify immigrants with confidence, they could give a useful account of the issues.<ref>Montgomery, Janet, et al. \"Continuity or colonization in Anglo-Saxon England?

Furthermore, they found that there was no change in this pattern over time, except amongst some females.<ref>Hughes, Susan S., et al. \"Anglo-Saxon origins investigated by isotopic analysis of burials from Berinsfield, Oxfordshire, UK.\" Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014): 81\u201392.</ref>\n\nAnother isotopic method has been employed to investigate whether protein sources in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex. This would provide evidence for social advantage. The results suggest that protein sources varied little according to geographic location and that terrestrial foods dominated at all locations.<ref>Mays, S., and N. Beavan. \"An investigation of diet in early Anglo-Saxon England using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen.\" Journal of Archaeological Science 39.4 (2012): 867\u2013874.</ref>\n\n==Migration and acculturation theories==\n[[File:Anglo.Saxon.migration.5th.cen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Possible routes of Anglo-Saxon migration in the 5th/6th centuries]]\nVarious scholars have used a synthesis of evidence to present models to suggest an answer to the questions that surround the Anglo-Saxon settlement. These questions include: How many migrants were there? When did the \"Saxons\" gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation{{efn|The sudden and drastic change from Romano-Britainto Anglo-Saxon Britain was once widely accepted as providing clear evidence for a mass migration from continental Europe and the near-complete replacement of the indigenous population in England}} of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation.  Heinrich H\u00e4rke explains the nature of this agreement: <blockquote>\"It is now widely accepted that the Anglo-Saxons were not just transplanted Germanic invaders and settlers from the Continent, but the outcome of insular interactions and changes. But we are still lacking explicit models that suggest how this ethnogenetic process might have worked in concrete terms\".<ref>In the abstract for: H\u00e4rke, Heinrich. \"Anglo-Saxon Immigration and Ethnogenesis.\" Medieval Archaeology 55.1 (2011): 1\u201328.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Estimating continental migrants' numbers===\nKnowing the number of migrants who came from the continent provides a context from which scholars can build an interpretation framework and understanding of the events of the 5th and 6th centuries. Robert Hedges in discussing this point observes that \"archaeological evidence only addresses these issues indirectly.\"<ref name=\"Hedges, Robert 2011. pp 81-83\">{{cite book|last=Hedges|first= Robert|chapter= Anglo-Saxon migration and the molecular evidence|title=The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology|editor1-last= Hamerow|editor1-first=Helena|editor2-last= Hinton|editor2-first=David A.|editor3-last= Crawford|editor3-first=Sally|location= Oxford, UK|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2011|pages=81\u201383|isbn=9780199212149|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=xucNJfS42PwC&pg=PA79&dq=anglo-saxon+migration#v=onepage&q=anglo-saxon%20migration&f=false}}</ref> \nThe traditional methodology used by archaeology to estimate the number of migrants starts with a figure for the population in Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries. This is usually estimated at between 2 and 4 million.<ref>Millet, Martin. \"The Romanization of Britain.\" An Essay in Archaeological Interpretation (1990).</ref> From this figure it is estimated that the population of Southern and Eastern England is 1 million. Within 200 years the settlement density has been established as an Anglo-Saxon village every {{convert|2|-|5|km|abbr=off}}, in the areas where evidence has been gathered.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. \"The earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History 1 (2005): 263\u201390.</ref> Given that these settlements are typically of around 50 people, this implies an Anglo-Saxon population in Southern and Eastern England of 250,000. This estimate is hardly certain, but does provide a ratio of 1 to 4 between those with a settler background and those with an insular background.\n\nThe number of migrants therefore depends on the population increase variable. If the population rose by 1 per cent per year (which is slightly less than the present world population growth rate) this would suggest a population of 30,000 migrants. However, if the population rose by 2 percent per year (which is similar to India in the last 20 years) this would suggest a population of 5,000 migrants.<ref name=\"Hedges, Robert 2011. pp 81-83\"/>\n\nThis number is confirmed by the archaeological evidence. The excavations at Spong Hill, for example, revealed over 2,000 cremations and inhumations in what is a very large early cemetery. However, when the period of use is taken into account (over 200 years) and its size, it is presumed to be a major cemetery for the entire area and not just one village; it does point to a smaller rather than larger number of original immigrants of 20,000.<ref>The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Spong Hill, North Elmham. Norfolk Archaeological Unit, 1995.</ref>\n\nHeinrich H\u00e4rke concluded that \"most of the biological and cultural evidence points to a minority immigration on the scale of 10 to 20% of the native population. The immigration itself was not a single \u2018invasion\u2019, but rather a series of intrusions and immigrations over a considerable period, differing from region to region, and changing over time even within regions. The total immigrant population may have numbered somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 over about a century, but the geographical variations in numbers, and in social and ethnic composition, should have led to a variety of settlement processes.\"<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 2011\"/>\n\nGenerally, the problems associated with seeking estimates for the population before AD 1089 were set out by Mark Thomas, Michael Stumpf and Heinrich H\u00e4rke. They suggest that \"Incidental reports of numbers of immigrants are notoriously unreliable, and absolute numbers of immigrants before the Norman period can only be calculated as a proportion of the estimated overall population.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2008\">Thomas, Mark G., Michael PH Stumpf, and Heinrich H\u00e4rke. \"Integration versus apartheid in post-Roman Britain: a response to Pattison.\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 275.1650 (2008): 2419\u20132421.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy between, on the one hand, archaeological and some historical ideas about the scale of the Anglo-Saxon immigration, and on the other, estimates of the genetic contribution of the Anglo-Saxon immigrants to the modern English gene pool ([[#Molecular evidence|see \"Molecular evidence\" above]]). Mark Thomas, Michael Stumpf and Heinrich H\u00e4rke created a statistical study of the two groups: those who held the \"Migrant\" Y chromosome and those that didn't. They examined the effect of differential reproductive success between those groups, coupled with limited intermarriage between the groups, on the spread of the genetic variant to discover whether the levels of migration needed to meet a 50% contribution to the modern gene pool. What they found is the genetic pool can rise from less than 5% to more than 50% in as little as 200 years with the addition of a slight increase in reproduction advantage of 1.8 (meaning a ratio 51.8 to 50) and restricting the amount of female (migrant genes) and male (indigenous genes) inter-breeding to at most 10%.<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2006\"/>\n\n===\"Saxon\" political ascendancy in Britain===\n[[File:Saxon.emigration.5th.cen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Areas which are the most probable areas for Settler communities]]\n\nA re-evaluation of the traditional picture of decay and dissolution in post-Roman Britain has occurred, with [[sub-Roman Britain]] being thought rather more a part of the Late Antique world of western Europe than was customary a half century ago.<ref>A. S. Esmonde Cleary, 'The Roman to medieval transition', in Britons and Romans: advancing an archaeological agenda, eds S. James and M.

This in large part stems from attempts to develop visions of British success against the incoming Anglo-Saxons, as suggested by the Chronicles which were written in the ninth and mid-tenth century. However, recent scholarship has contested the extent to which either can be credited with any level of historicity regarding the decades around AD 500.<ref>D. N. Dumville, 'Sub-Roman Britain: History and legend', History, 62, 1977, pp. 173\u201392; Dumville, 'The historical value of the Historia Brittonum', Arthurian Literature, 6, 1986, pp. 1\u201326</ref>\n \nThe representation of long-lasting British triumphs against the Saxons appears in large parts of the Chronicles, but stems ultimately from Gildas's brief and frustratingly elusive reference to a British victory at [[Mons Badonicus]] \u2013 Mount Badon ([[#Historical evidence|see historical evidence above]]). Nick Higham suggests that the war between Britons and Saxons seems to have ended in some sort of compromise, which conceded a very considerable sphere of influence within Britain to the incomers. According to Higham;\n:The most developed vision of a \u2018big\u2019 sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own political and military destiny for well over a century, is that of Kenneth Dark, who has argued that Britain should not be divided during the fifth, and even the bulk of the sixth, century into \u2018British\u2019 and \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 cultural and/or political provinces, but should be thought of as a generally \u2018British\u2019 whole. His thesis, in brief, is to postulate not just survival but continuing cultural, political and military power for the sub-Roman elite, both in the far west (where this view is comparatively uncontroversial) but also in the east, where it has to be imagined alongside incoming settlements. He postulates the sub-Roman community to have been the dominant force in insular affairs right up to c.570.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Nick|last=Higham|title=From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages|journal=History Compass|date=January 2004|volume=2|issue=1|pages=**|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2004.00085.x}}</ref>\n\nKenneth Dark's argument for continuing British military and political power in the east rests on the very uneven distribution of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries and the proposition that large gaps in that distribution necessarily represent strong British polities which excluded Anglo-Saxon settlers by force.<ref>Dark, K., Civitas to Kingdom: British Political Continuity 300\u201380 (London, Leicester University Press, 1994) p&nbsp;97\u2013104</ref> Cremation cemeteries in eastern Britain north of the Thames begin during the second quarter of the fifth century,<ref>J.

Wollman (Heidelberg, Carl Winter, 1990), pp. 17\u201336.</ref> backed up by new archaeological phases before 450 ([[#Archaeological evidence|see Archaeological evidence above]]). The chronology of this \"adventus\" of cremations is supported by the [[Gallic Chronicle of 452]], which states that wide parts of Britain fell under Saxon rule in 441. However, this did not result in many Brittonic words entering Old English. It seems therefore that no large-scale interaction occurred between incoming \"Germanic\" communities and numerous indigenous Brittonic speakers of equivalent social rank. If such interaction had been widespread, then we might have expected far greater language borrowing both in terms of structure and vocabulary ([[#Linguistic evidence|see linguistic evidence above]]).\n\n==='Romano-Brittonic' peoples' fate in the south-east===\nThe most extreme estimation for the size of the Anglo-Saxon settlement suggests that some 80% of the resident population of Britain were not Anglo-Saxon. Given that, explanation has been sought to account for the change in culture of the Britons to one where by the 8th Century the majority of people in southern Britain saw themselves as heirs to the Anglo-Saxon culture. Whilst the developments were rather complicated, there are two competing theories.\n\nOne theory, first set out by [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], suggests that the Anglo Saxons and the Britons were competing cultures, and that through invasion, extermination, slavery, and forced resettlement the Anglo-Saxons defeated the Britons and consequently their culture and language prevailed.<ref>Freeman, E.A. (1869) ''Old English History for Children'', MacMillan, London, pp. 7, 27\u201328</ref>\nThis view has influenced much of the linguistic, scholarly and popular perceptions of the process of anglicisation in Britain. It remains the starting point and 'default position', to which other hypotheses are compared in modern reviews of the evidence.<ref>Grimmer, M. (2007) ''Invasion, Settlement or Political Conquest: Changing Representations of the Arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain'', Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association, 3(1) pp. 169\u2013186.</ref> Widespread extermination and displacement of the native peoples of Britain is still considered a viable possibility by certain scholars.<ref>Ausenda, G. (1997) ''Current issues and future directions in the study of the early Anglo-Saxon period'', in Hines, J. (ed.) ''The Anglo-Saxons from Migration Period to the Eighth Century'', Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology, pp. 411\u2013450</ref>  Our best contemporary source, Gildas, certainly suggests that just such a change of populations did take place. However, Freeman's ideas did not go unchallenged, even as they were being propounded. In particular, the essayist [[Grant Allen]] believed in a strong Celtic contribution to Englishness.\n\nAnother theory has challenged this view and started to examine evidence that the majority of [[Anglo Saxons]] were [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]] in origin. The major evidence comes firstly from the figures, taking a fairly high Anglo-Saxon figure (200,000) and a low Brittonic one (800,000), Britons are likely to have outnumbered Anglo-Saxons by at least four to one. The interpretation of such figures is that while \"culturally, the later Anglo-Saxons and English did emerge as remarkably un-British,&nbsp;... their genetic, biological make-up is none the less likely to have been substantially, indeed predominantly, British\".<ref>Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" The English Historical Review 115.462 (2000): page 523</ref>\n\nTwo processes leading to Anglo-Saxonisation have been proposed. One is similar to culture changes observed in Russia, North Africa and parts of the Islamic world, where a politically and socially powerful minority culture becomes, over a rather short period, adopted by a settled majority. This  process is usually termed 'elite dominance'.<ref name=\"Ward-Perkins, Bryan 2000\">Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" The English Historical Review 115.462 (2000): 513\u2013533.</ref>\n\nThe second process is explained through incentives, such as the [[Wergild]] outlined in the law code of Ine of Wessex which produced an incentive to become Anglo-Saxon or at least English speaking.<ref name=\"Thomas, Mark G. 2006\"/> The wergild of an Englishman was set at a value twice that of a Briton of similar wealth. However, some Britons could be very prosperous and own five hides of land, which gave [[thegn]]-like status, with a wergild of 600 shillings.<ref>Lavelle, R. (2010) ''Alfred's Wars: Sources and Interpretations of Anglo-Saxon Warfare in the Viking Age'', Boydell & Brewer p. 85</ref> Ine set down requirements to prove guilt or innocence, both for his English subjects and for his British subjects, who were termed 'foreigners/wealas' ('Welshmen').<ref name=attenborough52>Attenborough. [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/34/mode/2up The laws of Ine and Alfred. pp.&nbsp;35\u201361]</ref> The binary ethnic distinction that appears in Ine's Laws seems to be between ' Englisc/English ('us') and 'Wylisc/Welsh' ('them'). Since Ine's people self-identified as Saxons (West Saxons) this very early use of the word 'English' (unless it is a later introduction into the text) suggests that it was the use of a particular language, already recognised as a single language, and already called 'English', that was the crucial determinant in ethnic identity. This implies that in the early Anglo-Saxon period it was language use that was the key determination of ethnicity, and not whether you had \"Germanic\" ancestors.\n\nWhatever the case, a continuity of 'sub-Roman' Britons cannot be doubted, as evidenced, for example, by the sheer number of burials which already date to the late 5th and early 6th centuries \u2013 otherwise impossible to maintain by even the largest 'migration' estimates. In addition to the 'highland Tyrants' in the west, the case has been made by persistence of a 'native', post-Roman, polity of sorts ''south'' of the Thames during much of the fifth century \u2013 evidenced by the oppositional deposition of [[Quoit Brooch Style]] artefacts in inhumation burials south of the Thames versus 'Scandinavian' artefacts (such as 'square headed brooches') within predominantly cremation burial settings dominate ''north'' of the Thames (i.e. in \"Anglian\" areas). However, a take-over by continental migrants cannot be denied, as evidenced by an abrupt end of Quoit Broch style artefacts and inundation of exotic artefacts of a \"Jutish' character in the final decade or two of the fifth century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Suzuki|2000|pp=114\u2013121}}</ref> Thus Ken Dark's notion of a long chronology of a surviving, even dominant \"sub-Roman\" Britain finds little support.<ref>{{harvtxt|Higham| 2004|p= 4}}</ref> Moreover, Halsall argues that 'Britons' are scarcely if at all visible in the archaeological record of lowland England by the 6th century and beyond, not because of any bizarre notions of ethnic cleansing or 'apartheid', but simply because, by then, everyone was an 'Anglo-Saxon', whatever their geographic origin.<ref>{{harvtxt|Haslsall|2006 |P=232-4}}</ref>\n\n==Aspects of the success of the Anglo-Saxon settlement==\nThe reasons for the success of Anglo-Saxon settlements remain uncertain. [[Helena Hamerow]] has made an observation that in Anglo-Saxon society \"local and extended kin groups remained&nbsp;... the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period\". \"Local and extended kin groups\" is one of a number of possible reasons for success, along with societal advantages, freedom and the relationship to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish in the fifth and sixth centuries.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.p166</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Saxon political formation===\nNick Higham is convinced that the success of the Anglo-Saxon elite in gaining an early compromise shortly after the [[Battle of Badon]] is a key to the success of the culture. This produced a political ascendancy across the south and east of Britain, which in turn required some structure to be successful.<ref>Higham Nicholas J. \"From Tribal Chieftains to Christian Kings.\" The Anglo-Saxon World (2013): 126.</ref>\n\nThe Bretwalda concept is taken as evidence for a presence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families and a clear unitary oversight. Whether the majority of these leaders were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage they were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture is unclear. The balance of opinion is that most were migrants, although it shouldn't be assumed they were all Germanic ([[#Elite personal names evidence|see Elite personal names evidence]]). There is agreement that these were small in number and proportion, yet large enough in power and influence to ensure \"Anglo-Saxon\" acculturation in the lowlands of Britain.<ref>Yorke, Barbara. \"The vocabulary of Anglo-Saxon overlordship.\" Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History. BAR British Series 92 (1981): 171\u2013200.</ref> Most historians believe these elites were those named by Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and others, although there is discussion regarding their [[Floruit|floruit dates]]. Importantly, whatever their origin or when they flourished, they established their claim to lordship through their links to extended kin ties. As Helen Peake jokingly points out \"they all just happened to be related back to Woden\".<ref>Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain, Programme 2 \u2013 Three part Channel 4 series. 2004</ref>\n\nThe [[Tribal Hidage]] is evidence of the existence of numerous smaller provinces, meaning that southern and eastern Britain may have lost any macro-political cohesion in the fifth and sixth centuries and fragmented into many small autonomous units, though late Roman administrative organisation of the countryside may have helped dictate their boundaries. By the end of the sixth century the leaders of these communities were styling themselves kings, with the majority of the larger kingdoms based on the south or east coasts.<ref name=\"Davies, Wendy 2011\">Davies, Wendy, and Hayo Vierck. \"The contexts of Tribal Hidage: social aggregates and settlement patterns.\" Issues 44 (2011).</ref> They include the provinces of the Jutes of Hampshire and Wight, the South Saxons, Kent, the East Saxons, East Angles, Lindsey and (north of the Humber) Deira and Bernicia. Several of these kingdoms may have their foundation the former Roman civitas and this has been argued as particularly likely for the provinces of Kent, Lindsey, Deira and Bernicia, all of whose names derive from Romano-British tribal or district names.<ref name=\"Laycock, Stuart 2012\"/>\n\nThe southern and east coasts were, of course, the areas settled first and in greatest numbers by the settlers and so presumably were the earliest to pass from Romano-British to Anglo-Saxon control. Once established they had the advantage of easy communication with continental territories in Europe via the North Sea or the Channel. The east and south coast provinces may never have fragmented to the extent of some areas inland and by the end of the sixth century they were already beginning to expand by annexing smaller neighbours. Barbara Yorke suggests that such aggressiveness must have encouraged areas which did not already possess military protection in the form of kings and their armies to acquire their own war-leaders or protection alliances.<ref name=\"Yorke, Barbara 2002\"/> By the time of the Tribal Hidage there were also two large 'inland' kingdoms, those of the Mercians and West Saxons, whose spectacular growth we can trace in par in our sources for the seventh century, but it is not clear how far this expansion had proceeded by the end of the sixth century.<ref name=\"Davies, Wendy 2011\"/>\n\nWhat Bede seems to imply in his ''Bretwalda'' list of the elite is the ability to extract tribute and overawe and/or protect communities, which may well have been relatively short-lived in any one instance, but ostensibly \"Anglo-Saxon\" dynasties variously replaced one another in this role in a discontinuous but influential and potent roll call of warrior elites, with very few interruptions from other \"British\" warlords.<ref>Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 5.</ref> The success of this elite was felt beyond their geography, to include neighbouring British territories in the centre and west of what later became England, and even the far west of the island. Again, Bede was very clear that English imperium could on occasion encompass British and English kingships alike,<ref>As in his remarks on Edwin's imperium: Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 5, 9.</ref> and that Britons and Angles marched to war together in the early seventh century, under both British and English kings.<ref>As in his remarks concerning C\u00e6dwallon and Penda, Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 20.</ref> It is Bede who provides the most vivid picture of a late sixth- and early seventh-century Anglian warlord in action, in the person of [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria]], King of [[Bernicia]] (a kingdom with a non-English name), who rapidly built up a personal 'empire' by military victories over the Britons of the North, the [[D\u00e1l Riata|Scots of Dalriada]], the [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Angles of Deira]] and the Britons of north-eastern Wales, only ultimately to experience disaster at the hands of [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia]].<ref>Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, I, 34; II, 12.</ref>\n\n===Rural freedoms and kinship groups===\nWhere arable cultivation continued in early Anglo-Saxon England, there seems to have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, although we do not know whether there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.<ref>Hamerow, H. \"Early medieval settlement.\" The archaeology of rural communities in north-west Europe (2002): 400\u2013900.</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons settled in small groups covering a handful of widely dispersed local communities.<ref name=\"Wickham 2009 157\">{{Harvcolnb|Wickham|2009|p=157}}, ''The Inheritance of Rome''.</ref> These farms were for the most part mobile. This mobility, which was typical across much of Northern Europe took two forms: the gradual shifting of the settlement within its boundaries or the complete location of the settlement altogether. These shifting settlements (called ''Wandersiedlungen'' or \"wandering settlements\") were a common feature since the Bronze Age. Why farms became abandoned and then relocated is much debated. However it is suggested that this might be related to the death of a patron of the family or the desire to move to better farmlands.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Early medieval settlements: the archaeology of rural communities in North-West Europe 400\u2013900. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2004. p105</ref>\n\nThese farms are often falsely supposed to be \"peasant farms\". However, a ''ceorl'', who was the lowest ranking freeman in early Anglo-Saxon society, was not a peasant but an arms-owning male with access to law, support of a kindred and the wergild, situated at the apex of an extended household working at least one hide of land. It is the ceorl that we should associate with the standard {{convert|8|-|10|m|abbr=off}} x {{convert|4|-|5|m|abbr=off}} post-hole building of the early Anglo-Saxon period, grouped with others of the same kin group. Each such household head had a number of less-free dependants.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J. An English Empire: Bede, the Britons, and the Early Anglo-Saxon Kings. Vol 2 p244</ref>\n\nThe success of the rural world in the 5th and 6th centuries, according to the landscape archaeology, was due to three factors: the continuity with the past, with no evidence of up-rooting in the landscape; farmers' freedom and rights over lands, with provision of a rent or duty to an overlord, who provided only slight lordly input; and the common outfield arable land (of an outfield-infield system) that provided the ability to build kinship and group cultural ties.\n\n===Material culture===\nThe origins of the timber building tradition seen in early Anglo-Saxon England have generated much debate which has mirrored a wider debate about the cultural affinities of Anglo-Saxon material culture.\n[[File:Grubenhaus at Bede's World Jarrow.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|A type of Anglo-Saxon building called a Grubenhaus]]\n\n[[Philip Rahtz]] asserted that buildings seen in West Stow and Mucking had late Roman origins.<ref>Rahtz, Philip. \"Buildings and rural settlement.\" The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England 44 (1976): p 56</ref> Archaeologist Philip Dixon noted the striking similarity between Anglo-Saxon timber halls and Romano-British rural houses. The Anglo-Saxons did not import the 'long-house', the traditional dwelling of the continental Germanic peoples, to Britain. Instead they upheld a local vernacular British building tradition dating back to the late first century. This has been interpreted as evidence of the endurance of kinship and household structures from the Roman into the Anglo-Saxon period.<ref>Hodges, R. (1989) ''The Anglo-Saxon Achievement' Duckworth, London. {{ISBN|0-7156-2130-0}}, pp.&nbsp;34\u201336</ref><ref>Dixon, Philip. \"How Saxon is the Saxon house?\" Structural reconstruction. Oxford (1982).</ref>\n\nHowever, this has been considered too neat an explanation for all the evidence. Anne and Gary Marshall summarise the situation:\n<blockquote>\"One of the main problems in Anglo-Saxon archaeology has been to account for the apparent uniqueness of the English timber structures of the period. These structures seem to bear little resemblance either to earlier Romano-British or to continental models. In essence, the problem is that the hybrid Anglo-Saxon style seems to appear full-blown with no examples of development from the two potentially ancestral traditions&nbsp;\u2026 The consensus of the published work was that the Anglo-Saxon building style was predominantly home-grown.\" <ref>Marshall, Anne, and Garry Marshall. \"A survey and analysis of the buildings of Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon England.\" Medieval Archaeology 35 (1991): 29</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the [[Sutton Hoo]] burial, perhaps that of the East Anglian king [[Raedwald]], a long and complex iron chain, used for supending a cauldron from the beams of a hall, was found. It was the product of a continuous British smithing tradition dating to pre-Roman times. This was, however, a high-status object.<ref>Bruce-Mitford 1983, 511&ndash;553.</ref>\n\nFor Bryan Ward-Perkins the answer to the relative lack of native influence on everyday objects is found in the success of the Anglo-Saxon culture and highlights the micro-diversity and larger cohesion that produced a dynamic force in comparison to the Brittonic culture.<ref name=\"Ward-Perkins, Bryan 2000\"/> From beads and quoits to clothes and houses, there is something unique happening in the early Anglo-Saxon period. The material culture evidence shows that people adopted and adapted styles based on set roles and styles. John Hines, commenting on the diversity of nearly a thousand glass beads and many different clothes clasps from Lakenheath, states that these reveal a \"society where people relied on others to fulfill a role\" and \"what they had around them was making a statement\", not one about the individual, but about \"identity between small groups not within small groups\".<ref>John Hines: \"Stories from the Dark Earth: Meet the Ancestors Revisited\" Episode 4 BBC 2013</ref>\n\nJulian Richards commenting on this and other evidence suggests: \n<blockquote>\"[The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain] was more complex than a mass invasion bringing fully formed lifestyles and beliefs. The early Anglo-Saxon, just like today's migrants, were probably riding different cultural identities. They brought from their homelands the traditions of their ancestors. But they would have been trying to work out not only who they were, but who they wanted to be&nbsp;\u2026 and forge an identity for those who followed.\"<ref>Julian Richards: \"Stories from the Dark Earth: Meet the Ancestors Revisited\" Episode 4 BBC 2013</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLooking beyond simplistic 'homeland' scenarios, and explaining the observations that 'Anglo-Saxon' houses and other aspects of material culture do not find exact matches in the 'Germanic homelands' in Europe, Halsall explains the changes within the context of a larger 'North Sea interaction zone', including lowland England, Northern Gaul and northern Germany. These areas experienced marked social and cultural changes in the wake of Roman collapse\u2014experienced not only within the former Roman provinces (Gaul, Britain) but also in ''[[wiktionary:Barbaricum|Barbaricum]]'' itself. All three areas experienced changes in social structure, settlement patterns and ways of expressing identities, as well as tensions which created push and pull factors for migrations in, perhaps, multiple directions.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2011|p=35}}</ref>\n\n===Culture of belief===\nThe study of pagan religious practice in the early Anglo-Saxon period is difficult. Most of the texts that may contain relevant information are not contemporary, but written later by Christian writers who tended to have a hostile attitude to pre-Christian beliefs, and who may have distorted their portrayal of them. Much of the information used to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon paganism comes from later Scandinavian and Icelandic texts and there is a debate about how relevant these are. The study of pagan Anglo-Saxon beliefs has often been approached with reference to Roman or even Greek typologies and categories. Archaeologists therefore use such terms as gods, myths, temples, sanctuaries, priests, magic and cults. Charlotte Behr argues that this provides a worldview of Anglo-Saxon practice culture which is unhelpful.<ref>Behr, Charlotte. Review \"Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited, edited by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark & Sarah Semple, 2010. Oxford: Oxbow Books; {{ISBN|978-1-84217-395-4}}\". in Cambridge Archaeological Journal 21.02 (2011): 315\u2013316.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] employed a new method of looking at the belief systems of the fifth to seventh centuries, by arguing for a model of religion which was typified by a pick and choose approach. The period was exceptional because there was no orthodoxy or institutions to control or hinder the people. This freedom of culture is seen also in the Roman-British community and is very evident in the complaints of [[Gildas]].<ref>Brown, Peter. The Rise of Western Christendom. Oxford, 2003.</ref>\n\nOne Anglo-Saxon cultural practice that is better understood are the burial customs, due in part to archaeological excavations at various sites including [[Sutton Hoo]], [[Spong Hill]], [[Royal saxon tomb in Prittlewell|Prittlewell]], [[Snape boat grave|Snape]] and [[Walkington Wold Burials|Walkington Wold]], and the existence of around 1,200 pagan (or non-Christian) cemeteries. There was no set form of burial, with [[cremation]] being preferred in the north and [[inhumation]] in the south, although both forms were found throughout England, sometimes in the same cemeteries. When cremation did take place, the ashes were usually placed within an urn and then buried, sometimes along with [[grave goods]].<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 274.</ref> According to archaeologist Dave Wilson, \"the usual orientation for an inhumation in a pagan Anglo-Saxon cemetery was west\u2013east, with the head to the west, although there were often deviations from this.\"<ref>[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 87.</ref> Indicative of possible religious belief, grave goods were common amongst inhumation burials as well as cremations; free Anglo-Saxon men were buried with at least one weapon in the pagan tradition, often a [[seax]], but sometimes also with a [[Migration period spear|spear]], [[Migration period sword|sword]] or shield, or a combination of these.<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\"/> There are also a number of recorded cases of parts of animals being buried within such graves. Most common amongst these was body parts belonging to either [[goats]] or [[sheep]], although parts of [[oxen]] were also relatively common, and there are also isolated cases of [[goose]], [[crab apple]]s, duck eggs and [[hazelnuts]] being buried in graves. It is widely thought therefore that such items constituted a food source for the deceased.<ref>[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. pp.&nbsp;98\u2013100.</ref> In some cases, animal skulls, particularly oxen but also pig, were buried in human graves, a practice that was also found earlier in [[Roman Britain]].<ref name=\"Hutton 1991. p. 274\"/>\n\nThere is also evidence for the continuation of Christianity in south and east Britain. The Christian shrine at St Albans and its martyr cult survived throughout the period ([[#Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae|see Gildas above]]). There are references in Anglo-Saxon poetry, including Beowulf, that show some interaction between pagan and Christian practices and values. While there is little scholarly focus on this subject, there is enough evidence from Gildas and elsewhere that it is safe to assume some continuing \u2013 perhaps more free \u2013 form of Christianity survived. Richard Whinder states \"(The Church's pre-Augustine) characteristics place it in continuity with the rest of the Christian Church in Europe at that time and, indeed, in continuity with the Catholic faith&nbsp;... today.\" <ref>Whinder, R, Christianity in Britain before St Augustine Catholic History Society 2008</ref>\n     \nThe complexity of belief, indicated by various pieces of evidence, is disturbing to those looking for easy categories. The extent to which belief was discursive and free during the settlement period suggests a lack of proscription, indeed, this might be a characteristic of Anglo-Saxon cultural success.\n\n===Language and literature===\nLittle is known about the everyday spoken language of people living in the migration period. Old English is a [[Language contact|contact language]] and  reconstructing the [[pidgin]] used in this period from the written language found in the West Saxon literature of some 400 years later is difficult. Two general theories are proposed regarding why people changed their language to Old English (or an early form of such); either a person or household changed so as to serve an elite, or a person or household changed through choice as it provided some advantage economically or legally.<ref>Killie, Kristin. \"Old English\u2013Late British language contact and the English progressive.\" Language Contact and Development Around the North Sea 321 (2012): p119</ref>\n\nAccording to Nick Higham, the adoption of the language\u2014as well as the material culture and traditions\u2014of an Anglo-Saxon elite, \"by large numbers of the local people seeking to improve their status within the social structure, and undertaking for this purpose rigorous acculturation\", is the key to understanding the transition from Romano-British to Anglo-Saxon. The progressive nature of this language acquisition, and the 'retrospective reworking' of kinship ties to the dominant group led, ultimately, to the \"myths which tied the entire society to immigration as an explanation of their origins in Britain\".<ref>Higham, N. 1992. Rome, Britain and the Anglo-Saxons. Guildford: Seaby p&nbsp;229\u2013230</ref>\n \nThe final few lines of the poem \"[[Battle of Brunanburh (poem)|The Battle of Brunanburh]]\", a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon poem that celebrates a victory of [[\u00c6thelstan]], the first king of all the English, give a poetic voice to the English conception of their origins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old-English poem The Battle of Brunanburh along with translations and background information|url=http://loki.stockton.edu/~kinsellt/litresources/brun/brun2.html#astext}}</ref>\n \n{| cellpadding=\"6\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:50%;\" |'''''Old English'''''\n| style=\"width:50%;\" |'''''Modern English'''''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n''...Engle and Seaxe upp becomon,<br/>\n''ofer brad brimu Britene sohton, <br/>\n''wlance wig-smithas, Wealas ofercomon,<br/>\n''eorlas ar-hwaete eard begeaton.<br/>\n|\n...Angles and Saxons came up <br/>\nover the broad sea. Britain they sought,<br/>\nProud war-smiths who overcame the Welsh,<br/>\nglorious warriors they took hold of the land. <br/>\n|}\n\nThis 'heroic tradition' of conquering incomers is consistent with the conviction of [[Bede]], and later Anglo-Saxon historians, that the ancestral origin of the English was not the result of any assimilation with the native British, but was derived solely from the Germanic migrants of the post-Roman period. It also explains the enduring appeal of poems and heroic stories such as [[Beowulf]], [[Wulf and Eadwacer]] and [[Judith (poem)|Judith]], well into the Christian period. The success of the language is the most obvious result of the settlement period. This language was not just the language of acculturation, but through its stories, poetry and oral traditions became the agency of change.<ref>Harris, Stephen (2003) ''Race and Ethnicity in Anglo-Saxon Literature'' Routledge, DOIhttps://doi.org/10.4324/9780203497999, eBook {{ISBN|9781135924379}}</ref>\n\nNick Higham has provided this summary of the processes:\n<blockquote>\"As Bede later implied, language was a key indicator of ethnicity in early England.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.
