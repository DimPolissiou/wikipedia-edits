Hence in any order in which an act is pure act, it will only exist, in that order, as a unique and unlimited act. But whenever it is finite and manifold, it has entered into a true composition with potency.</li>\n<li>Consequently, the one God, unique and simple, alone subsists in absolute being. All other things that participate in being have a nature whereby their being is restricted; they are constituted of essence and being, as really distinct principles.</li>\n<li>A thing is called a being because of \"esse\". God and creature are not called beings univocally, nor wholly equivocally, but analogically, by an analogy both of attribution and of proportionality.</li>\n<li>In every creature there is also a real composition of the subsisting subject and of added secondary forms, i.e. [[Accidental property|accidental]] forms. Such composition cannot be understood unless being is really received in an essence distinct from it.</li>\n<li>Besides the absolute accidents there is also the relative accident, relation. Although by reason of its own character relation does not signify anything inhering in another, it nevertheless often has a cause in things, and hence a real entity distinct from the subject.</li>\n<li>A [[spiritual creature]] is wholly simple in its essence. Yet there is still a twofold composition in the spiritual creature, namely, that of the essence with being, and that of the substance with accidents.</li>\n<li>However, the corporeal creature is composed of act and potency even in its very essence. These act and potency in the order of essence are designated by the names form and matter respectively.</li>\n</ol>\n\n==== Cosmology ====\n{{See also|Cosmology (metaphysics)|l1=Cosmology}}\n\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Neither the matter nor the form have being of themselves, nor are they produced or corrupted of themselves, nor are they included in any category otherwise than reductively, as substantial principles.</li>\n<li>Although extension in quantitative parts follows upon a corporeal nature, nevertheless it is not the same for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is truly an accident.</li>\n<li>The principle of individuation, i.e., of numerical distinction of one individual from another with the same specific nature, is matter designated by quantity. Thus in pure spirits there cannot be more than one individual in the same specific nature.</li>\n<li>By virtue of a body's quantity itself, the body is circumscriptively in a place, and in one place alone circumscriptively, no matter what power might be brought to bear.</li>\n<li>Bodies are divided into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life. In the case of the living things, in order that there be in the same subject an essentially moving part and an essentially moved part, the substantial form, which is designated by the name soul, requires an organic disposition, i.e. heterogeneous parts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n==== Psychology ====\n{{See also|Psychology}}\n\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>Souls in the vegetative and sensitive orders cannot subsist of themselves, nor are they produced of themselves. Rather, they are no more than principles whereby the living thing exists and lives; and since they are wholly dependent upon matter, they are incidentally corrupted through the corruption of the composite.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, the human soul subsists of itself. When it can be infused into a sufficiently disposed subject, it is created by God. By its very nature, it is incorruptible and immortal.</li>\n<li>This rational soul is united to the body in such a manner that it is the only substantial form of the body. By virtue of his soul a man is a man, an animal, a living thing, a body, a substance and a being. Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.</li>\n<li>From the human soul there naturally issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the non-organic. The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as their subject. The non-organic powers have the soul alone as their subject. Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.</li>\n<li>Intellectuality necessarily follows upon immateriality, and furthermore, in such manner that the further the distance from matter, the higher the degree of intellectuality. Any being is the adequate object of understanding in general. But in the present state of union of soul and body, quantities abstracted from the material conditions of individuality are the proper object of the human intellect.</li>\n<li>Therefore, we receive knowledge from sensible things. But since sensible things are not actually intelligible, in addition to the intellect, which formally understands, an active power must be acknowledged in the soul, which power abstracts intelligible likeness or species from sense images in the imagination.</li>\n<li>Through these intelligible likenesses or species we directly know universals, i.e. the natures of things. We attain to singulars by our senses, and also by our intellect, when it beholds the sense images. But we ascend to knowledge of spiritual things by analogy.</li>\n<li>The will does not precede the intellect but follows upon it. The will necessarily desires that which is presented to it as a good in every respect satisfying the appetite.

For example, the word \"healthy\" is analogical in that it applies both to a healthy person or animal (those that enjoy of good health) and to some food or drink (if it is good for the health).\n* '''Equivocation''' is the complete change in meaning of the descriptor and is an [[informal fallacy]].

Later, Aquinas and his school would find a formidable opponent in the ''via moderna'', particularly in [[William of Ockham]] and his adherents.\n\nThomism remained a doctrine held principally by Dominican theologians, such as [[Giovanni Capreolo]] (1380\u20131444) or [[Thomas Cajetan|Tommaso de Vio]] (1468\u20131534). Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through for example the Dominicans [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (particularly noteworthy for his work in natural law theory), [[Domingo de Soto]] (notable for his work on economic theory), [[John of St. Thomas]], and [[Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez]]; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the [[School of Salamanca|Salmanticenses]]); and even, in a way, the newly formed [[Jesuits]], particularly [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]], and [[Luis de Molina]].\n\nThe modern period brought considerable difficulty for Thomism.<ref name=\"decline\">{{CathEncy|last=Kennedy|first=Daniel|wstitle=Thomism|volume=14}} \"Gradually, however, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there came a decline in the study of the works of the great Scholastics.\"</ref> By the 19th century, Aquinas's theological doctrine was often presented in seminaries through his Jesuit manualist interpreters, who adopted his theology in an eclectic way, while his philosophy was often neglected altogether in favor of [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]]. Many think the manualist approach had more in common with Duns Scotus than it did with Aquinas\u2014thus is more properly labeled [[Neo-Scholasticism]]. And in all this, the Dominican Order, was having [[Dominican order#Nineteenth century to present|demographic difficulties]]. \n\nPope [[Leo XIII]] attempted a Thomistic revival, particularly with his 1879 encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' and his establishment of the Leonine Commission, established to produce critical editions of Aquinas' ''opera omnia''. This encyclical served as the impetus for the rise of Neothomism, which brought an emphasis on the [[ethic]]al parts of Thomism, as well as a large part of its views on life, humans, and theology, are found in the various schools of [[Neothomism]]. Neothomism held sway as the dominant philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church until the [[Second Vatican Council]], which seemed to confirm the significance of [[Ressourcement]] theology. Thomism remains a school of philosophy today, and influential in Catholicism, though \"The Church has no philosophy of her own nor does she canonize any one particular philosophy in preference to others.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=John Paul II |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_15101998_fides-et-ratio_en.html |title=''Fides et ratio'', 49 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126183043/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_15101998_fides-et-ratio_en.html |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.\"\n\n===Influence on Jewish thought===\nAquinas' doctrines, because of their close relationship with those of Jewish philosophy, found great favor among Jews. [[Judah Romano]] (born 1286) translated Aquinas' ideas from Latin into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] under the title ''Ma'amar ha-Mamschalim'', together with other small treatises extracted from the \"Contra Gentiles\" (\"Neged ha-Umot\").\n\n[[Eli Habillo]] (1470) translated, without the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] title, the \"Qu\u00e6stiones Disputat\u00e6,\" \"Qu\u00e6stio de Anima,\" his \"De Anim\u00e6 Facultatibus,\" under the title \"Ma'amar be-Ko\u1e26ot ha-Nefesh,\" (edited by Jellinek); his \"De Universalibus\" as \"Be-Inyan ha-Kolel\"; \"Shaalot Ma'amar beNim\u1e93a we-biMehut.\"\n\nAbraham Nehemiah ben Joseph (1490) translated Aquinas's \"Commentarii in Metaphysicam.\" According to [[Moses Almosnino]], [[Isaac Abravanel]] desired to translate the \"Qu\u00e6stio de Spiritualibus Creaturis.\" Abravanel indeed seems to have been well acquainted with the philosophy of Aquinas, whom he mentions in his work \"Mif'alot Elohim\" (vi. 3). The physician Jacob Zahalon (d. 1693) translated some extracts from the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.\n\n==Connection with Jewish thought==\nAquinas did not disdain to draw upon [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophical]] sources. His main work, the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', shows a profound knowledge not only of the writings of [[Avicebron]] (Ibn Gabirol), whose name he mentions, but also of most Jewish philosophical works then existing.\n\nAquinas pronounces himself energetically<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.3, art. 7 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> against the hypothesis of the eternity of the world, in agreement with both [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Jewish theology]].

II, \u00a713.]]}}\n\n====G. K. Chesterton====\nIn describing Thomism as a philosophy of common sense, [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote:\n{{quote|\nSince the modern world began in the sixteenth century, nobody's system of philosophy has really corresponded to everybody's sense of reality; to what, if left to themselves, common men would call common sense. Each started with a paradox; a peculiar point of view demanding the sacrifice of what they would call a sane point of view. That is the one thing common to [[Hobbes]] and [[Hegel]], to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Bergson]], to [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[William James]]. A man had to believe something that no normal man would believe, if it were suddenly propounded to his simplicity; as that law is above right, or right is outside reason, or things are only as we think them, or everything is relative to a reality that is not there. The modern philosopher claims, like a sort of confidence man, that if we will grant him this, the rest will be easy; he will straighten out the world, if he is allowed to give this one twist to the mind...\n\nAgainst all this the philosophy of St. Thomas stands founded on the universal common conviction that eggs are eggs. The Hegelian may say that an egg is really a hen, because it is a part of an endless process of Becoming; the Berkelian may hold that [[poached egg]]s only exist as a dream exists, since it is quite as easy to call the dream the cause of the eggs as the eggs the cause of the dream; the Pragmatist may believe that we get the best out of scrambled eggs by forgetting that they ever were eggs, and only remembering the scramble. But no pupil of St. Thomas needs to addle his brains in order adequately to addle his eggs; to put his head at any peculiar angle in looking at eggs, or squinting at eggs, or winking the other eye in order to see a new simplification of eggs. The Thomist stands in the broad daylight of the brotherhood of men, in their common consciousness that eggs are not hens or dreams or mere practical assumptions; but things attested by the Authority of the Senses, which is from God.|Chesterton, ''St. Thomas Aquinas'', p. 147.}}\n\n==History==\nJ. A. Weisheipl emphasizes that within the [[Dominican Order]] the history of Thomism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas:\n{{quote|Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} \u201cThe Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, \u201d James Weisheipl, 1962.</ref>}}\n\nAn idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican Thomism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nOutside the [[Dominican Order]] Thomism has had varying fortunes leading some to periodize it historically or thematically. Weisheipl distinguishes \"wide\" Thomism, which includes those who claim to follow the spirit and basic insights of Aquinas and manifest an evident dependence on his texts, from \"eclectic\" Thomism which includes those with a willingness to allow the influence of other philosophical and theological systems in order to relativize the principles and conclusions of traditional Thomism. [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] gives an historic division of Thomism including 1) the period of Aquinas and his first followers from the 13th to 15th centuries, a second Thomism from the 16th to 18th centuries, and a Neo-Thomism from the 19th to 20th centuries.<ref>John Haldane, 1998. \"Thomism\".

Romanus Cessario thinks it better not to identify intervals of time or periods within the larger history of Thomism because Thomists have addressed such a broad variety of issues and in too many geographical areas to permit such divisions.<ref>''A Short History of Thomism'', Catholic University of America Press, 2005</ref>\n\n===First Thomistic School===\nThe first period of Thomism stretches from Aquinas' teaching activity beginning in 1256 at Paris to Cologne, Orvieto, Viterbo, Rome, and Naples until his canonization in 1325. In this period his doctrines \"were both attacked and defended\" as for example after his death (1274) the condemnations of 1277, 1284 and 1286 were counteracted by the General Chapters of the [[Dominican Order]] and other disciples who came to Aquinas' defense.<ref name=\"Roensch1964\">{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

This movement received impetus from [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' of 1879.

Its focus, however, is less exegetical and more concerned with carrying out the program of deploying a rigorously worked out system of Thomistic metaphysics in a wholesale critique of modern philosophy.

Gilson's reading of Aquinas as putting forward a distinctively \"Christian philosophy\" tended, at least in the view of his critics, to blur Aquinas's distinction between philosophy and theology.<ref>Gilson wrote about the topic of [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] in a [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/ chapter of his book ''Le Thomisme''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605082527/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/ |date=5 June 2011 }}.</ref> [[Jacques Maritain]] (1882\u20131973) introduced into Thomistic metaphysics the notion that philosophical reflection begins with an \"intuition of being,\" and in ethics and social philosophy sought to harmonize Thomism with [[personalism]] and pluralistic democracy. Though \"existential Thomism\" was sometimes presented as a counterpoint to modern [[existentialism]], the main reason for the label is the emphasis this approach puts on Aquinas's doctrine of existence.

It seems fair to say that most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.<ref name=:0/>\n\n===Lublin Thomism<!--'Lublin Thomism' and 'Phenomenological Thomism' redirect here-->===\n'''Lublin Thomism''',<ref name=:0/> which derives its name from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]] in Poland where it is centered, is also sometimes called \"'''phenomenological Thomism'''.\"<ref name=:0/> Like transcendental Thomism, it seeks to combine Thomism with certain elements of modern philosophy. In particular, it seeks to make use of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] method of philosophical analysis associated with [[Edmund Husserl]] and the [[ethical personalism]] of writers like [[Max Scheler]] in articulating the Thomist conception of the human person. Its best-known proponent is [[Karol Wojtyla]] (1920\u20132005), who went on to become Pope John Paul II.<ref name=:0/>\n\nHowever, unlike transcendental Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places priority on existence (as opposed to essence), making it an existential Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of \u00c9tienne Gilson. The phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute [[idealism]]. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.<ref name=\"Jaroszynski\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |title=A Brief Overview of Lublin Thomism |publisher=Hyoomik.com |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194904/http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Analytical Thomism===\n{{main|Analytical Thomism}}\n[[Analytical Thomism]]<ref name=:0/> described by [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]], its key proponent, as \"a broad philosophical approach that brings into mutual relationship the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the concepts and concerns shared by Aquinas and his followers\" (from the article on \"analytical Thomism\" in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', edited by Ted Honderich). By \"recent English-speaking philosophy\" Haldane means the [[Analytical philosophy|analytical tradition]] founded by thinkers like [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], which tends to dominate academic philosophy in the English-speaking world. [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919\u20132001) and her husband [[Peter Geach]] are sometimes considered the first \"analytical Thomists,\" though (like most writers to whom this label has been applied) they did not describe themselves in these terms, and as Haldane's somewhat vague expression \"mutual relationship\" indicates, there does not seem to be any set of doctrines held in common by all analytical Thomists. What they do have in common seems to be that they are philosophers trained in the analytic tradition who happen to be interested in Aquinas in some way; and the character of their \"analytical Thomism\" is determined by whether it tends to stress the \"analytical\" side of analytical Thomism, or the \"Thomism\" side, or, alternatively, attempts to emphasize both sides equally.<ref name=\"Feser2\">{{cite web|author=Edward Feser |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part II|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129012252/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all|author-link=Edward Feser}}</ref><ref>[https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf The introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526201136/https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf |date=26 May 2011 }} to [http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 Paterson & Pugh's book on Analytical Thomism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404000911/http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 |date=4 April 2016 }} is available gratis online.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nIn his ''[[Against Henry, King of the English]]'', Luther criticized the use of the [[proof by assertion]] and a reliance on style over substance in the [[Summa Theologica#Structure|Thomist form of disputation]], which he alleged as being, \"It seems so to me.

Hence in any order in which an act is pure act, it will only exist, in that order, as a unique and unlimited act. But whenever it is finite and manifold, it has entered into a true composition with potency.</li>\n<li>Consequently, the one God, unique and simple, alone subsists in absolute being. All other things that participate in being have a nature whereby their being is restricted; they are constituted of essence and being, as really distinct principles.</li>\n<li>A thing is called a being because of \"esse\". God and creature are not called beings univocally, nor wholly equivocally, but analogically, by an analogy both of attribution and of proportionality.</li>\n<li>In every creature there is also a real composition of the subsisting subject and of added secondary forms, i.e. [[Accidental property|accidental]] forms. Such composition cannot be understood unless being is really received in an essence distinct from it.</li>\n<li>Besides the absolute accidents there is also the relative accident, relation. Although by reason of its own character relation does not signify anything inhering in another, it nevertheless often has a cause in things, and hence a real entity distinct from the subject.</li>\n<li>A [[spiritual creature]] is wholly simple in its essence. Yet there is still a twofold composition in the spiritual creature, namely, that of the essence with being, and that of the substance with accidents.</li>\n<li>However, the corporeal creature is composed of act and potency even in its very essence. These act and potency in the order of essence are designated by the names form and matter respectively.</li>\n</ol>\n\n==== Cosmology ====\n{{See also|Cosmology (metaphysics)|l1=Cosmology}}\n\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Neither the matter nor the form have being of themselves, nor are they produced or corrupted of themselves, nor are they included in any category otherwise than reductively, as substantial principles.</li>\n<li>Although extension in quantitative parts follows upon a corporeal nature, nevertheless it is not the same for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is truly an accident.</li>\n<li>The principle of individuation, i.e., of numerical distinction of one individual from another with the same specific nature, is matter designated by quantity. Thus in pure spirits there cannot be more than one individual in the same specific nature.</li>\n<li>By virtue of a body's quantity itself, the body is circumscriptively in a place, and in one place alone circumscriptively, no matter what power might be brought to bear.</li>\n<li>Bodies are divided into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life. In the case of the living things, in order that there be in the same subject an essentially moving part and an essentially moved part, the substantial form, which is designated by the name soul, requires an organic disposition, i.e. heterogeneous parts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n==== Psychology ====\n{{See also|Psychology}}\n\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>Souls in the vegetative and sensitive orders cannot subsist of themselves, nor are they produced of themselves. Rather, they are no more than principles whereby the living thing exists and lives; and since they are wholly dependent upon matter, they are incidentally corrupted through the corruption of the composite.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, the human soul subsists of itself. When it can be infused into a sufficiently disposed subject, it is created by God. By its very nature, it is incorruptible and immortal.</li>\n<li>This rational soul is united to the body in such a manner that it is the only substantial form of the body. By virtue of his soul a man is a man, an animal, a living thing, a body, a substance and a being. Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.</li>\n<li>From the human soul there naturally issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the non-organic. The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as their subject. The non-organic powers have the soul alone as their subject. Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.</li>\n<li>Intellectuality necessarily follows upon immateriality, and furthermore, in such manner that the further the distance from matter, the higher the degree of intellectuality. Any being is the adequate object of understanding in general. But in the present state of union of soul and body, quantities abstracted from the material conditions of individuality are the proper object of the human intellect.</li>\n<li>Therefore, we receive knowledge from sensible things. But since sensible things are not actually intelligible, in addition to the intellect, which formally understands, an active power must be acknowledged in the soul, which power abstracts intelligible likeness or species from sense images in the imagination.</li>\n<li>Through these intelligible likenesses or species we directly know universals, i.e. the natures of things. We attain to singulars by our senses, and also by our intellect, when it beholds the sense images. But we ascend to knowledge of spiritual things by analogy.</li>\n<li>The will does not precede the intellect but follows upon it. The will necessarily desires that which is presented to it as a good in every respect satisfying the appetite. But it freely chooses among the many goods that are presented to it as desirable according to a changeable judgment or evaluation. Consequently, the choice follows the final practical judgment. But the will is the cause of it being the final one.</li>\n</ol>\n\n==== God ====\n{{See also|God}}\n\n<ol start=\"22\">\n<li>We do not perceive by an immediate intuition that God exists, nor do we prove it ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. But we do prove it ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', i.e., from the things that have been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a [[active intellect|separated intellect]] which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.</li>\n<li>The metaphysical motion of the Divine Essence is correctly expressed by saying that it is identified with the exercised actuality of its own being, or that it is subsistent being itself. And this is the reason for its infinite and unlimited perfection.</li>\n<li>By reason of the very purity of His being, God is distinguished from all finite beings. Hence it follows, in the first place, that the world could only have come from God by creation; secondly, that not even by way of a miracle can any finite nature be given creative power, which of itself directly attains the very being of any being; and finally, that no created agent can in any way influence the being of any effect unless it has itself been moved by the first Cause.</li>\n</ol>\n\n== Metaphysics ==\nAquinas says that the fundamental [[axiom]]s of [[ontology]] are the [[principle of non-contradiction]] and the [[principle of causality]].

For instance, when the word \"milk\" is applied both to milk produced by cows and by any other female mammal.\n* '''Analogy''' occurs when a descriptor changes some but not all of its meaning. For example, the word \"healthy\" is analogical in that it applies both to a healthy person or animal (those that enjoy of good health) and to some food or drink (if it is good for the health).\n* '''Equivocation''' is the complete change in meaning of the descriptor and is an [[informal fallacy]]. For example, when the word \"bank\" is applied to river banks and financial banks, modern philosophers talk of [[ambiguity]].\n\nFurther, the usage of \"[[definition]]\" that Aquinas gives is the [[genus]] of the being, plus a difference that sets it apart from the genus itself.

Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through for example the Dominicans [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (particularly noteworthy for his work in natural law theory), [[Domingo de Soto]] (notable for his work on economic theory), [[John of St. Thomas]], and [[Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez]]; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the [[School of Salamanca|Salmanticenses]]); and even, in a way, the newly formed [[Jesuits]], particularly [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]], and [[Luis de Molina]].\n\nThe modern period brought considerable difficulty for Thomism.<ref name=\"decline\">{{CathEncy|last=Kennedy|first=Daniel|wstitle=Thomism|volume=14}} \"Gradually, however, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there came a decline in the study of the works of the great Scholastics.\"</ref> By the 19th century, Aquinas's theological doctrine was often presented in seminaries through his Jesuit manualist interpreters, who adopted his theology in an eclectic way, while his philosophy was often neglected altogether in favor of [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]].

The physician Jacob Zahalon (d. 1693) translated some extracts from the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.\n\n==Connection with Jewish thought==\nAquinas did not disdain to draw upon [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophical]] sources.

Chesterton]] wrote:\n{{quote|\nSince the modern world began in the sixteenth century, nobody's system of philosophy has really corresponded to everybody's sense of reality; to what, if left to themselves, common men would call common sense. Each started with a paradox; a peculiar point of view demanding the sacrifice of what they would call a sane point of view. That is the one thing common to [[Hobbes]] and [[Hegel]], to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Bergson]], to [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[William James]]. A man had to believe something that no normal man would believe, if it were suddenly propounded to his simplicity; as that law is above right, or right is outside reason, or things are only as we think them, or everything is relative to a reality that is not there. The modern philosopher claims, like a sort of confidence man, that if we will grant him this, the rest will be easy; he will straighten out the world, if he is allowed to give this one twist to the mind...\n\nAgainst all this the philosophy of St. Thomas stands founded on the universal common conviction that eggs are eggs. The Hegelian may say that an egg is really a hen, because it is a part of an endless process of Becoming; the Berkelian may hold that [[poached egg]]s only exist as a dream exists, since it is quite as easy to call the dream the cause of the eggs as the eggs the cause of the dream; the Pragmatist may believe that we get the best out of scrambled eggs by forgetting that they ever were eggs, and only remembering the scramble. But no pupil of St. Thomas needs to addle his brains in order adequately to addle his eggs; to put his head at any peculiar angle in looking at eggs, or squinting at eggs, or winking the other eye in order to see a new simplification of eggs. The Thomist stands in the broad daylight of the brotherhood of men, in their common consciousness that eggs are not hens or dreams or mere practical assumptions; but things attested by the Authority of the Senses, which is from God.|Chesterton, ''St. Thomas Aquinas'', p. 147.}}\n\n==History==\nJ. A. Weisheipl emphasizes that within the [[Dominican Order]] the history of Thomism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas:\n{{quote|Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} \u201cThe Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, \u201d James Weisheipl, 1962.</ref>}}\n\nAn idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican Thomism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nOutside the [[Dominican Order]] Thomism has had varying fortunes leading some to periodize it historically or thematically. Weisheipl distinguishes \"wide\" Thomism, which includes those who claim to follow the spirit and basic insights of Aquinas and manifest an evident dependence on his texts, from \"eclectic\" Thomism which includes those with a willingness to allow the influence of other philosophical and theological systems in order to relativize the principles and conclusions of traditional Thomism. [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] gives an historic division of Thomism including 1) the period of Aquinas and his first followers from the 13th to 15th centuries, a second Thomism from the 16th to 18th centuries, and a Neo-Thomism from the 19th to 20th centuries.<ref>John Haldane, 1998. \"Thomism\".

Romanus Cessario thinks it better not to identify intervals of time or periods within the larger history of Thomism because Thomists have addressed such a broad variety of issues and in too many geographical areas to permit such divisions.<ref>''A Short History of Thomism'', Catholic University of America Press, 2005</ref>\n\n===First Thomistic School===\nThe first period of Thomism stretches from Aquinas' teaching activity beginning in 1256 at Paris to Cologne, Orvieto, Viterbo, Rome, and Naples until his canonization in 1325. In this period his doctrines \"were both attacked and defended\" as for example after his death (1274) the condemnations of 1277, 1284 and 1286 were counteracted by the General Chapters of the [[Dominican Order]] and other disciples who came to Aquinas' defense.<ref name=\"Roensch1964\">{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

This movement received impetus from [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' of 1879.

Its focus, however, is less exegetical and more concerned with carrying out the program of deploying a rigorously worked out system of Thomistic metaphysics in a wholesale critique of modern philosophy.

It seems fair to say that most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.<ref name=:0/>\n\n===Lublin Thomism<!--'Lublin Thomism' and 'Phenomenological Thomism' redirect here-->===\n'''Lublin Thomism''',<ref name=:0/> which derives its name from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]] in Poland where it is centered, is also sometimes called \"'''phenomenological Thomism'''.\"<ref name=:0/> Like transcendental Thomism, it seeks to combine Thomism with certain elements of modern philosophy. In particular, it seeks to make use of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] method of philosophical analysis associated with [[Edmund Husserl]] and the [[ethical personalism]] of writers like [[Max Scheler]] in articulating the Thomist conception of the human person. Its best-known proponent is [[Karol Wojtyla]] (1920\u20132005), who went on to become Pope John Paul II.<ref name=:0/>\n\nHowever, unlike transcendental Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places priority on existence (as opposed to essence), making it an existential Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of \u00c9tienne Gilson. The phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute [[idealism]]. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.<ref name=\"Jaroszynski\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |title=A Brief Overview of Lublin Thomism |publisher=Hyoomik.com |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194904/http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Analytical Thomism===\n{{main|Analytical Thomism}}\n[[Analytical Thomism]]<ref name=:0/> described by [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]], its key proponent, as \"a broad philosophical approach that brings into mutual relationship the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the concepts and concerns shared by Aquinas and his followers\" (from the article on \"analytical Thomism\" in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', edited by Ted Honderich). By \"recent English-speaking philosophy\" Haldane means the [[Analytical philosophy|analytical tradition]] founded by thinkers like [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], which tends to dominate academic philosophy in the English-speaking world. [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919\u20132001) and her husband [[Peter Geach]] are sometimes considered the first \"analytical Thomists,\" though (like most writers to whom this label has been applied) they did not describe themselves in these terms, and as Haldane's somewhat vague expression \"mutual relationship\" indicates, there does not seem to be any set of doctrines held in common by all analytical Thomists. What they do have in common seems to be that they are philosophers trained in the analytic tradition who happen to be interested in Aquinas in some way; and the character of their \"analytical Thomism\" is determined by whether it tends to stress the \"analytical\" side of analytical Thomism, or the \"Thomism\" side, or, alternatively, attempts to emphasize both sides equally.<ref name=\"Feser2\">{{cite web|author=Edward Feser |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part II|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129012252/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all|author-link=Edward Feser}}</ref><ref>[https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf The introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526201136/https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf |date=26 May 2011 }} to [http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 Paterson & Pugh's book on Analytical Thomism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404000911/http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 |date=4 April 2016 }} is available gratis online.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nIn his ''[[Against Henry, King of the English]]'', Luther criticized the use of the [[proof by assertion]] and a reliance on style over substance in the [[Summa Theologica#Structure|Thomist form of disputation]], which he alleged as being, \"It seems so to me.

In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In mid-1969, she was involved in a dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues. The two major issues were Gandhi supporting the independent candidate, [[V. V.

Once again, politician [[K. Kamaraj]] was instrumental in achieving this result. In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In mid-1969, she was involved in a dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues. The two major issues were Gandhi supporting the independent candidate, [[V. V. Giri]], rather than the official Congress party candidate, [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]], for the vacant post of the [[President of India]].<ref>Singh, M.P., 1981.

It soon came to be known as the New Congress. In the All India Congress Committee, 446 of its 705 members walked over to Indira's side. This created a belief among Indians that Indira's Congress was the Real Congress (INC-R). After the separation of the two parties, there was also a dispute about the party logo. The \"Old Congress\" retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke while Indira's breakaway faction were given a new symbol of a cow with suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol. The split occurred when, in 1969, a united opposition under the banner of [[Samyukt Vidhayak Dal]], won control over several states in the [[Hindi Belt]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=npdqD_TXucQC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22indira+gandhi%22+cow++calf+symbol&source=bl&ots=5QKcTsp9OM&sig=cX0FN-NrU1t3iW7Nz5GsDEDjA74&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SybQUvnRG7PUsATChYCwDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22indira%20gandhi%22%20cow%20%20calf%20symbol&f=false Indira congress]</ref>\n\nIn the mid-term parliamentary elections held in 1971, the Gandhi-led Congress&nbsp;(R) Party won a landslide victory on a platform of progressive policies such as the elimination of poverty ([[Garibi Hatao]]).<ref name=\"1971 result\">{{cite web|title=General Elections, India, 1971: Statistical report |url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/statisticalreports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |website=eci.nic.in |publisher=[[Election Commission of India]] |accessdate=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718175452/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2014  }}</ref> The policies of the Congress&nbsp;(R) Party under Gandhi before the 1971 elections included proposals to abolish the [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purse]] to former rulers of the [[Princely states]], and the 1969 [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of India's 14 largest banks.<ref name=nationalisation>{{cite news|title=Economic Milestone: Nationalisation of Banks (1969)|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-nationalisation-of-banks-(1969)/38415/1|accessdate=17 September 2015 |work=[[Forbes India]]|publisher=Forbes|date=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Indira-Gandhi-ili-50-img-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indira Gandhi]], second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the only woman to hold the office.]]\n\nThe New Congress Party's popular support began to wane in the mid-1970s.

She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs, and had stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP), led by [[Sharad Pawar]]. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere.

In the intervening years, the party was successful at various legislative assembly elections; at one point, Congress ruled 15 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=16 December 2017|date=4 March 2018}}</ref> For the 2004 general election, Congress forged alliances with regional parties including the NCP and the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/election/2004/may/14congress.htm|title=The mathematics of politics|website=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=16 May 2004}}</ref> The party's campaign emphasised social inclusion and the welfare of the common masses{{emdash}}an ideology that Gandhi herself endorsed for Congress during her presidency{{emdash}}with slogans such as ''Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath'' (\"Congress hand in hand with the common man\"), contrasting with the NDA's \"[[India Shining]]\" campaign.<ref name=\"negi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/politics/sonia-gandhis-legacy-she-reinvented-herself-to-fight-off-challenges-but-also-had-her-share-of-failures-1606229.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's Legacy: She Reinvented Herself to Fight Off Challenges but also Had Her Share of Failures|last=Negi|first=Saroj|website=[[India Today]]|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=16 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/sonia-gandhi-congress-president-rahul-gandhi-politics-4983911/|title=Sonia Gandhi retires as Congress president, to remain active in politics|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 December 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-sonia-gandhi-makes-way-4984673/ |title=As Sonia Gandhi makes way|last=Chowdhary|first=Neerja|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Naqshbandi\">{{cite news|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html |title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband Rajiv's death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-gandhi/sonia-gandhi-keeps-congress-hopes-alive-in-india-polls-idUSTRE53D1XH20090414 |title=Sonia Gandhi keeps Congress hopes alive in India polls|last=Chandra|first=Rina|work=Reuters|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 222 seats in the new parliament, defeating the NDA by a substantial margin.

The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector.
