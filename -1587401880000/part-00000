There he found the lectures of [[Nevill Coghill]] and [[C. S. Lewis]] particularly rewarding. As poetry adviser to the firm of [[Routledge]], he co-edited ''Eight Oxford Poets'' in 1941, with [[Sidney Keyes]] and Michael Meyer,<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> and helped to edit ''Oxford Poetry'' in 1942\u20131943.\n\nBy that time Heath-Stubbs had recognized his homosexuality. However, his love for the poet and artist Philip Rawson was returned only in the form of strong friendship. Heath-Stubbs returned in the early 1940s to regular [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] worship.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nHe held the Gregory Fellowship of Poetry at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] in 1952\u20131955, and professorships in [[Alexandria, Egypt]] in 1955\u20131958 and at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1960\u20131961. He taught at the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea in 1962\u20131972, and at [[Merton College, Oxford]] for twenty years from 1972. He lived for a time in the 1950s at [[Zennor]] in [[Cornwall]].\n\nHeath-Stubbs's translations include works by [[Sappho]], [[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]], and most notably [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. He was a representative figure in British poetry in the early 1950s, editing the poetry anthology ''Images of Tomorrow'' (1953), and with [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] the ''[[Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse]]'', among others. He was elected to the [[Royal Society of Literature|RSL]] in 1954, awarded the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] 1973, and appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1989.<ref name=\"Guardian\" >{{Cite news |last=Meyer |first=Michael |date=29 December 2006 |title=John Heath-Stubbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1979644,00.html |work=Obituary from The Guardian |location=London, England |access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Heath Stubbs by Patrick Swift c.1960.jpg|thumb|''John Heath-Stubbs'', by [[Patrick Swift]], c. 1960]]\nAlthough diagnosed with glaucoma at the age of 18, he was able to read with his left eye until 1961, but was completely blind from 1978.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Nonetheless he continued to write almost to the end. A documentary film about him, entitled ''Ibycus: A Poem by John Heath-Stubbs'', was made by the [[Chile]]an director Carlos Klein in 1997.\n\nJohn Heath-Stubbs died in London on 26 December 2006, aged 88.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\n==Writing style==\nAs a Romantic poet, Heath-Stubbs's diction was strong, yet subtle. Running through his work was a nostalgia for \"classicism\". He was consciously literary and his work elaborately wrought rather than spontaneous, which meant his was not the kind of poetry likely to have mass appeal. However, his devotion to the craft of poetry makes his work impressive.
