{"title_page": "Logarithmic scale", "text_new": "A '''logarithmic scale''' (or '''log scale''') is a way of displaying numerical data over a very wide range of values in a compact way\u2014typically the largest numbers in the data are hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the smallest numbers. Such a [[scale (measurement)|scale]] is [[nonlinear]]: the numbers 10 and 20, and 90 and 100, are not the same distance apart on a log scale. Rather, the numbers 10 and 100, and 100 and 1000 are equally spaced. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been ''multiplied'' by 10 (or some other fixed factor). Often [[exponential growth]] curves are displayed on a log scale, otherwise they would increase too quickly to fit within a small [[Plot (graphics)|graph]]. Another way to think about it is that the ''number of [[Numerical digit |digits]]'' of the data grows at a constant rate. The numbers 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 are equally spaced on a log scale, but the number of digits is going up by 1 each time: 2, 3, 4, and 5 digits.

Due to the identity\n\n: <math>\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b},</math>\n\nthe logarithms of any given number ''a'' to two different bases (here ''b'' and ''c'') differ only by the constant factor log<sub>''c''</sub>&nbsp;''b''.  This constant factor can be considered to represent the conversion factor for converting a numerical representation of the pure (indefinite) logarithmic quantity Log(''a'') from one arbitrary unit of measurement (the [log&nbsp;''c''] unit) to another (the [log&nbsp;''b''] unit), since\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{Log}(a) = (\\log_b a)[\\log b] = (\\log_c a)[\\log c] .</math>\n\nFor example, [[Boltzmann]]'s standard definition of entropy ''S'' = ''k''&nbsp;ln&nbsp;''W'' (where ''W'' is the number of ways of arranging a system and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]]) can also be written more simply as just ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log(''W''), where \"Log\" here denotes the indefinite logarithm, and we let ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[log&nbsp;e]; that is, we identify the physical entropy unit ''k'' with the mathematical unit [log&nbsp;e].  This identity works because\n\n: <math>\\ln W = \\log_e W = \\frac{\\operatorname{Log}(W)}{\\log e}.</math>\n\nThus, we can interpret Boltzmann's constant as being simply the expression (in terms of more standard physical units) of the abstract logarithmic unit [log&nbsp;e] that is needed to convert the dimensionless pure-number quantity ln&nbsp;''W'' (which uses an arbitrary choice of base, namely e) to the more fundamental pure logarithmic quantity Log(''W''), which implies no particular choice of base, and thus no particular choice of physical unit for measuring entropy.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Alexander Graham Bell]]\n* [[Bode plot]]\n* [[John Napier]]\n* [[Level (logarithmic quantity)]]\n* [[Logarithm]]\n* [[Logarithmic mean]]\n* [[Log semiring]]\n* [[Preferred number]]\n\n===Scale===\n* [[Order of magnitude]]\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Entropy]]\n* [[Entropy (information theory)]]\n* [[pH]]\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |author-first1=Stanislas |author-last1=Dehaene |author-first2=V\u00e9ronique |author-last2=Izard |author-first3=Elizabeth |author-last3=Spelke |author-link3=Elizabeth Spelke |author-first4=Pierre |author-last4=Pica |author-link4=Pierre Pica |date=2008 |title=Log or linear?

This constant factor can be considered to represent the conversion factor for converting a numerical representation of the pure (indefinite) logarithmic quantity Log(''a'') from one arbitrary unit of measurement (the [log&nbsp;''c''] unit) to another (the [log&nbsp;''b''] unit), since\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{Log}(a) = (\\log_b a)[\\log b] = (\\log_c a)[\\log c] .</math>\n\nFor example, [[Boltzmann]]'s standard definition of entropy ''S'' = ''k''&nbsp;ln&nbsp;''W'' (where ''W'' is the number of ways of arranging a system and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]]) can also be written more simply as just ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log(''W''), where \"Log\" here denotes the indefinite logarithm, and we let ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[log&nbsp;e]; that is, we identify the physical entropy unit ''k'' with the mathematical unit [log&nbsp;e].  This identity works because\n\n: <math>\\ln W = \\log_e W = \\frac{\\operatorname{Log}(W)}{\\log e}.</math>\n\nThus, we can interpret Boltzmann's constant as being simply the expression (in terms of more standard physical units) of the abstract logarithmic unit [log&nbsp;e] that is needed to convert the dimensionless pure-number quantity ln&nbsp;''W'' (which uses an arbitrary choice of base, namely e) to the more fundamental pure logarithmic quantity Log(''W''), which implies no particular choice of base, and thus no particular choice of physical unit for measuring entropy.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Alexander Graham Bell]]\n* [[Bode plot]]\n* [[John Napier]]\n* [[Level (logarithmic quantity)]]\n* [[Logarithm]]\n* [[Logarithmic mean]]\n* [[Log semiring]]\n* [[Preferred number]]\n\n===Scale===\n* [[Order of magnitude]]\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Entropy]]\n* [[Entropy (information theory)]]\n* [[pH]]\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |author-first1=Stanislas |author-last1=Dehaene |author-first2=V\u00e9ronique |author-last2=Izard |author-first3=Elizabeth |author-last3=Spelke |author-link3=Elizabeth Spelke |author-first4=Pierre |author-last4=Pica |author-link4=Pierre Pica |date=2008 |title=Log or linear?

His last team was [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Ol\u00edmpica de Itabaiana|Itabaiana]].\n\n==Career==\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 [[Turkcell Super League|Turkish league]] season Washington scored 9 goals in 12 games, but was subsequently released by [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] because of his health problems.\n\nWashington was submitted to a [[coronary catheterization]]. Once recovered, physicians told him that playing football would not represent a risk to his condition. He then signed with Brazilian club [[Clube Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense|Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense]] where he was [[2004 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|2004]] [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|S\u00e9rie A]] top-scorer with 34 goals and broke the league's record. For his recovery, he was dubbed ''Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente'', the title of the movie ''[[Braveheart]]'' in Brazil.\n\nIn 2005, he moved to Japan to play for [[Tokyo Verdy]] in the [[J1 League]]. He had a successful season there with 22 goals in 33 games but could not save his club from relegation. In 2006, he transferred to [[Urawa Red Diamonds]] and helped the Reds win their first ever J1 League title, becoming the top scorer in the league with 26 goals in 26 games. In 2007, he was the [[FIFA Club World Cup#Honours|2007 FIFA Club World Cup top scorer]], helping his team to a third-place finish in the competition.\n\nOn 21 December 2007 Washington returned to Brazil to play for [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]]. His contract was valid through the end of 2008. Washington finished as the 2008 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A top scorer, with 21 goals, tied with [[Keirrison de Souza Carneiro|Keirrison]] and [[Kl\u00e9ber Boas|Kl\u00e9ber Pereira]].<ref name=\"topscorerseriea2008\">{{cite web | title = Washington, Keirrison e Kl\u00e9ber Pereira s\u00e3o os artilheiros do Brasileiro com 21 gols | url=http://oglobo.globo.com/esportes/brasileiro2008/mat/2008/12/07/washington_keirrison_kleber_pereira_sao_os_artilheiros_do_brasileiro_com_21_gols-586887786.asp| accessdate = 8 December 2008 | date = 7 December 2008 | publisher=[[O Globo]]|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Even though he renewed his contract with [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] until the end of the 2010 season<ref name=\"Washington por mais um ano\">[http://www.saopaulofc.net/v4/noticias2NOVO2.asp?PLC_map_001_c=02.01&PLC_cng_ukey=40156154409TNR8B29 S\u00e3o Paulo acerta com Washington por mais um ano] {{in lang|pt}}</ref> he eventually returned to [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]] on July 27, 2010.
