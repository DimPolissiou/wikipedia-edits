It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.\n\nIn 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. \u00a35 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>\n\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of \u00a31 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx|title=Banknote Production|last=|first=|date=|website=bankofengland.co.uk|publisher=Bank of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.

Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England \u2013 Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>\n\n:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and [[market intelligence]] functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.\nThe Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:\n* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and\n* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.\nThe 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank.

It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.\n\nIn 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. \u00a35 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>\n\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of \u00a31 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx|title=Banknote Production|last=|first=|date=|website=bankofengland.co.uk|publisher=Bank of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.

In 1421 he fought for the [[Papal States]] against [[Perugia]] and for a short time for the Florentines against [[Milan]]. He and his brother [[Galeazzo Malatesta|Galeazzo]] were captured at [[Gradara]] in 1424 after their father's and their cousin Carlo's defeat at [[Zagonara]] by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]]. Carlo joined the Visconti army and in 1426 fought in [[Romagna]] against the Anti-Visconti League.\n\nIn 1427 he was made captain general of the Visconti armies, putting him in command of 1,200 cavalry in the battle against [[Francesco Bussone]]. The Visconti force was defeated at [[Pizzighettone]] and Carlo was captured again until being freed when the two sides made peace. In 1428 Carlo married [[Colonna family|Vittoria Colonna]], [[Pope Martin V]]'s niece, but the couple remained childless. In 1430 he fought against [[Rimini]] but was defeated and fled from [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]. Shortly afterwards he defended [[Bologna]] against an attack by [[Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio]].\n\nIn 1431 a revolt broke out in [[Pesaro]], forcing Carlo to retreat to [[Fossombrone]] then to Gradara and elsewhere. In 1433 he helped the Montefeltro and the Visconti reconquer their own lands. The resulting treaty brought peace between the Papal States and the two Malatesta brothers, Carlo and Galeazzo.

In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.\n\n== Murders ==\n\n[[File:Buckskin Girl.jpg|thumb|[[forensic facial reconstruction|Forensic rendering]] of Marcia King, nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl,\" who remained unidentified between 1981 and 2018.]]\n\nThree of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the woman died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years.

She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the victim was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious \u201cDr. No\u201d May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders.

Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, she gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. In connection with this, the police and later the media coined the nickname for the unidentified criminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/I-71-murder-victim-talked-with-police-before-disappearing/6359544251600/|title=I-71 murder victim talked with police before disappearing.

The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the victim's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoos on her body, as well as jewelry the offender had not stolen, she remained unidentified until 2010.

Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.\n\n[[File:Licking County Jane Doe Reconstruction 008.jpg|thumb|right|Forensic rendering of Patrice Corely, who remained unidentified in 2017 after 27 years.]]\n\nAccording to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another female was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remained unidentified (with the placeholder name \"Jane Doe 2\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer.

The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the woman died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years.

She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the victim was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body.

During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.\n\n[[File:Licking County Jane Doe Reconstruction 008.jpg|thumb|right|Forensic rendering of Patrice Corely, who remained unidentified in 2017 after 27 years.]]\n\nAccording to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another female was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer.

The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards.

They board a west-bound train to [[Pomona (Amtrak station)|Pomona]], but are both immediately kicked off by the conductor, played by Pete, stating that dogs aren't allowed (side gag reveals Pluto's luggage to contain bones).  Pete then rambles off the train's destinations and forces his watch to tell him when the train is ready to leave.  When the watch does show its time for the train to go, Pete calls \"All aboard!\"\n\nMickey, at this point, decides to smuggle Pluto onboard by squeezing the dog inside his suitcase. At first, the handle breaks, making Mickey almost leave Pluto behind, but he recovers the suitcase and manages to make it aboard the caboose just as the train is leaving the platform. Later, Pluto barks, wanting to be let out.  Mickey reminds him that he will be thrown off if Pete finds out that Pluto's on the train, so he takes Pluto out and unsquashes him.  The freedom is only short lived, however, as Pete is coming through the train to collect tickets, forcing Mickey to squash Pluto back into position in the suitcase. After biting \"OK\" in Mickey's tickets, Pete sees Mickey's suitcase containing Pluto in the seat and forcefully throws it into an overhead baggage net. This causes Pluto to bark, making Pete suspicious.\n\nHe then recognizes Mickey, who tries to hide behind a large newspaper and make it look like the barking was coming from him. Realizing that Pluto has been stowed in the suitcase, Pete menacingly asks Mickey if he is alone, which Mickey states that he is alone, Pete then makes up a story about owning a little cat who'd cry when he was all alone and screams a loud \"MEOW!\" (even making his face closely resemble a real cat) at the suitcase causing Pluto to leap out barking at the \"cat\". Realizing his cover's been blown, Pluto ducks back into the suitcase, but Pete has already figured it out.  Before he can catch the pair, Mickey and Pluto run away and a chase ensues on board the train.\n\nMickey and Pluto first hide in a sleeping car where Pete mistakenly intrudes on a female passenger and gets assaulted. Pete then stumbles into another bed where Mickey and Pluto (disguised as babies) are hiding. Pete apologizes for the intrusion, but quickly finds out after covering up Pluto's tail.  Just as Mickey and Pluto think that they fooled Pete, Pete bursts in and threatens to beat them to a pulp, but sudden darkness from the train running through a tunnel allows the pair to escape, leaving Pete to beat the mattress to a pulp and experience a brief entanglement with the springs.\n\nMickey and Pluto masquerade as the conductor by hiding in Pete's own coat and hat which they'd had taken off in the tunnel. After getting false directions from Mickey with a deep voice, Pete catches on and threatens to catch them, but ends up disturbing the female passenger again.  Pete receives another beating and, unintentionally taking the passenger's hat, gets pricked by one of her needles.  Mickey disguises himself as an [[Stereotypes of Native Americans|Indian chief]] with Pluto in his [[papoose]], but Pete sees through their disguise after Pluto bites his hand.\n\nWhile Mickey and Pluto are next to an open window, Pluto is caught on a passing [[mail hook]] which whisks him outside the train. Mickey runs after him through the train, and is just able to grab Pluto as he exits the caboose. Pete throws their luggage out after them and they fall to the ground from the mail hook. Mickey then looks up at the station sign and is pleasantly surprised that they have arrived at Pomona.\n\n==Voice-over footage==\n[[File:Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher.png|thumb|left|[[Walt Disney]] (left) and [[Billy Bletcher]] recording voice-overs for ''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'']]\n''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'' is unique among Disney shorts in that film footage exists of the [[voice-over]] session, which included Walt Disney and Billy Bletcher.

They board a west-bound train to [[Pomona (Amtrak station)|Pomona]], but are both immediately kicked off by the conductor, played by Pete, stating that dogs aren't allowed (side gag reveals Pluto's luggage to contain bones).  Pete then rambles off the train's destinations and forces his watch to tell him when the train is ready to leave.  When the watch does show its time for the train to go, Pete calls \"All aboard!\"\n\nMickey, at this point, decides to smuggle Pluto onboard by squeezing the dog inside his suitcase. At first, the handle breaks, making Mickey almost leave Pluto behind, but he recovers the suitcase and manages to make it aboard the caboose just as the train is leaving the platform. Later, Pluto barks, wanting to be let out.  Mickey reminds him that he will be thrown off if Pete finds out that Pluto's on the train, so he takes Pluto out and unsquashes him.  The freedom is only short lived, however, as Pete is coming through the train to collect tickets, forcing Mickey to squash Pluto back into position in the suitcase. After biting \"OK\" in Mickey's tickets, Pete sees Mickey's suitcase containing Pluto in the seat and forcefully throws it into an overhead baggage net. This causes Pluto to bark, making Pete suspicious.\n\nHe then recognizes Mickey, who tries to hide behind a large newspaper and make it look like the barking was coming from him.

Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".\n</ref>\n\nA version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".\n\nAs Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".\n\nA similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931.

Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design.

Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".\n</ref>\n\nA version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".\n\nAs Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".\n\nA similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931.

Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design.

Rabin comes from a musical family \u2013 his father is [[Trevor Rabin]], former guitarist of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from [[London]], was also at the commune.

They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.
