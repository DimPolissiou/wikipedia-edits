Lupin threatens to steal five of England's most prized treasures in hopes to humble the \"vanity\" of the English, and leaves a riddle containing information on what his first crime will be. Holmes and Watson determine that the theft will take place at the [[National Gallery]], and upon arriving there deduce that the object will be ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', which is symbolic of Britain\u2019s victory over France and Spain in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. They alert the Museum Director and [[Inspector Lestrade]] who has the Gallery guarded at every entrance. However, the next the morning, they find the guards knocked out and the painting stolen. Holmes learns that Lupin disguised himself as a visiting French painter named Horace Velmont, and hid himself before Lestrade arrived. Lupin leaves behind a letter with a clue as to where he will strike next. \n[[File:SH4 - Le British Museum.png|thumb|left|The British Museum as it appears in the game]]\nHolmes and Watson head to the [[Tower of London]], were they believe Lupin will steal [[Ravens of the Tower of London|the ravens]]. They arrived too late, as the ravens are reported missing and replaced with other individual birds and a bat which have been let lose. They capture the animals and find pieces of paper attached to them. From the messages in the papers, Holmes deduces what Lupin will do next. Holmes and Watson meet with Lestrade and the Prime Minister at the [[British Museum]] where Holmes informs then that Lupin tends to steal the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was taken by Britain from the French. Lestrade once again has the Museum guarded at every entrance but Lupin still manages to steal the stone right in front of them using ropes. He leaves behind yet another letter.\n\nHolmes determines that someone had unwittingly helped Lupin pass the security system. Unknown to him, Watson had befriended a journalist named Piers Urquhart Alenn who he helped into the museum to pay him back for favors. Watson soon confesses and Holmes deduces, to his horror, that Lupin\u2019s next target will be [[Queen Victoria]] herself. At [[Buckingham Palace]], Holmes and Watson find that the Prime Minister has had the place guarded heavily. Holmes learns that a French [[grandfather clock]] (which has a cupboard) was delivered to the queen\u2019s chamber and correctly deduces that Lupin made it to the queen. Lupin, however, does not hurt the queen but asks for a kiss which she obliges. She then allows him to use her secret corridor to escape. Holmes persuades Lupin but only manages to find another letter which clues to his next and final crime.\n\nThe Prime Minister congratulates Holmes and Watson for their role in protecting the Queen and asks Watson to decipher Lupin\u2019s message. Watson initially deduces that the next crime will be at the Tower of London but the Prime Minister reminds him that Lupin already struck there. Watson then determines that the final target will be [[Big Ben]]. Watson joins the Prime Minister, Lestrade and much of [[Scotland Yard]] to wait for Lupin there but Holmes goes to the Tower of London. He learns that Lupin\u2019s past four crimes were distractions from his real target, the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewel]]s. Holmes sabotages Lupin\u2019s plan and confronts him. The two express their mutual admiration for each other. Lupin agrees to return the stolen items and Holmes lets him go, knowing they will not he each other again. Holmes later tells Watson not to write about this endeavor.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin'' is an adventure played from a first person perspective. The player character for the majority of the game is Holmes, though some sections feature Watson and one features Inspector Lestrade. Most of the areas in which the game takes place are based on famous London landmarks, including the [[National Gallery]] and [[British Museum]], the former of which features scanned copies of dozens of famous paintings, as well as numerous historical artifacts. Solving the mysteries of the game involve examining locations and discovering clues.\n\nRetaining the first-person interface and gameplay of ''The Awakened'', the game follows Holmes and Watson as Holmes as they try to stop Lupin.<ref name=frogwares/> It is the first in the series to feature a cat-and-mouse style plot, a structure which would be retained for ''[[Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper]]''.\n\n==Remastered edition==\nOn May 18, 2010, Frogwares released a remastered version of ''Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin''. This version adds the option of a third person perspective, as well as walking animations for the sections of the game in which Holmes and Watson are together.

{"title_page": "Relevance logic", "text_new": "'''Relevance logic''', also called '''relevant logic''', is a kind of non-[[classical logic]] requiring the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]] of [[Entailment|implications]] to be relevantly related. They may be viewed as a family of [[substructural logic|substructural]] or [[modal logic|modal]] logics. (It is generally, but not universally, called ''relevant logic'' by Australian [[logician]]s, and ''relevance logic'' by other English-speaking logicians.)\n\nRelevance logic aims to capture aspects of implication that are ignored by the \"[[material conditional|material implication]]\" operator in classical [[truth-functional logic]], namely the notion of relevance between antecedent and conditional of a true implication.  This idea is not new: [[C. I. Lewis]] was led to invent modal logic, and specifically [[strict implication]], on the grounds that classical logic grants [[paradoxes of material implication]] such as the principle that [[Vacuous truth|a falsehood implies any proposition]].  Hence \"if I'm a donkey, then two and two is four\" is true when translated as a material implication, yet it seems intuitively false since a true implication must tie the antecedent and consequent together by some notion of relevance. And whether or not I'm a donkey seems in no way relevant to whether two and two is four.\n\nHow does relevance logic formally capture a notion of relevance? In terms of a syntactical constraint for a [[propositional calculus]], it is necessary, but not sufficient, that premises and conclusion share [[atomic formula]]e (formulae that do not contain any [[logical connective]]s). In a [[predicate calculus]], relevance requires sharing of variables and constants between premises and conclusion. This can be ensured (along with stronger conditions) by, e.g., placing certain restrictions on the rules of a natural deduction system. In particular, a Fitch-style [[natural deduction]] can be adapted to accommodate relevance by introducing tags at the end of each line of an application of an inference indicating the premises relevant to the conclusion of the inference. [[Gentzen]]-style [[sequent calculus|sequent calculi]] can be modified by removing the weakening rules that allow for the introduction of arbitrary formulae on the right or left side of the [[sequent]]s.\n\nA notable feature of relevance logics is that they are [[paraconsistent logic]]s: the existence of a contradiction will not cause \"[[principle of explosion|explosion]]\". This follows from the fact that a conditional with a contradictory antecedent that does not share any propositional or predicate letters with the consequent cannot be true (or derivable).\n\n==History==\n\nRelevance logic was proposed in 1928 by Russian Soviet philosopher [[Ivan E.

Drawing on them, [[Nuel Belnap]] and [[Alan Ross Anderson]] (with others) wrote the ''magnum opus'' of the subject, ''Entailment: The Logic of Relevance and Necessity'' in the 1970s (the second volume being published in the nineties). They focused on both systems of [[entailment]] and systems of relevance, where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary.\n\n==Axioms==\nThe early developments in relevance logic focused on the stronger systems. The development of the Routley\u2013Meyer semantics brought out a range of weaker logics. The weakest of these logics is the relevance logic B. It is axiomatized with the following axioms and rules.\n# <math>A\\to A</math>\n# <math>A\\land B\\to A</math>\n# <math>A\\land B\\to B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\land(A\\to C)\\to (A\\to B\\land C)</math>\n# <math>A\\to A\\lor B</math>\n# <math>B\\to A\\lor B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to C)\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\lor B\\to C)</math>\n# <math>A\\land(B\\lor C)\\to (A\\land B)\\lor(A\\land C)</math>\n# <math>\\lnot\\lnot A\\to A</math>\nThe rules are the following.\n# <math>A, A\\to B\\vdash B</math>\n# <math>A, B\\vdash A\\land B</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash (C\\to A)\\to(C\\to B)</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash (B\\to C)\\to(A\\to C)</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash \\lnot B\\to\\lnot A</math>\nStronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms.\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to (\\lnot B\\to\\lnot A)</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\to C)</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to((B\\to C)\\to(A\\to C))</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to((C\\to A)\\to(C\\to B))</math>\n# <math>(A\\to(A\\to B))\\to(A\\to B)</math>\n# <math>(A\\land (A\\to B))\\to B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to\\lnot A)\\to\\lnot A</math>\n# <math>(A\\to (B\\to C))\\to(B\\to(A\\to C))</math>\n# <math>A\\to((A\\to B)\\to B)</math>\n# <math>((A\\to A)\\to B)\\to B</math>\n# <math>A\\lor\\lnot A</math>\n# <math>A\\to(A\\to A)</math>\nThere are some notable logics stronger than B that can be obtained by adding axioms to B as follows.\n* For DW, add axiom 1.\n* For DJ, add axioms 1, 2.\n* For TW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4.\n* For RW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.\n* For T, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11.\n* For R, add axioms 1-11.\n* For E, add axioms 1-7, 10, 11, <math>((A\\to A)\\land(B\\to B)\\to C)\\to C</math>, and <math>\\Box A\\land \\Box B\\to \\Box (A\\land B)</math>, where <math>\\Box A</math> is defined as <math>(A\\to A)\\to A</math>.\n* For RM, add all the additional axioms.\n\n==Models==\n===Routley\u2013Meyer models===\nThe standard model theory for relevance logics is the Routley-Meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by [[Richard Sylvan|Richard Routley]] and [[Bob Meyer (logician)|Robert Meyer]]. A Routley\u2013Meyer frame F for a propositional language is a quadruple (W,R,*,0), where W is a non-empty set, R is a ternary relation on W, and * is a function from W to W, and <math>0\\in W</math>. A Routley-Meyer model M is a Routley-Meyer frame F together with a valuation, <math>\\Vdash</math>, that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point <math>a\\in W</math>. There are some conditions placed on Routley-Meyer frames. Define <math>a\\leq b</math> as <math>R0ab</math>.\n* <math>a\\leq a</math>.\n* If <math>a\\leq b</math>  and <math>b\\leq c</math>, then <math>a\\leq c</math>.\n* If <math>d\\leq a</math> and <math>Rabc</math>, then <math>Rdbc</math>.\n* <math>a^{**}=a</math>.\n* If <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>b^*\\leq a^*</math>.\nWrite <math>M,a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\nVdash A</math> to indicate that the formula <math>A</math> is true, or not true, respectively, at point <math>a</math> in <math>M</math>. \nOne final condition on Routley-Meyer models is the hereditariness condition.\n* If <math>M,a\\Vdash p</math> and <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>M,b\\Vdash p</math>, for all atomic propositions <math>p</math>.\nBy an inductive argument, hereditariness can be shown to extend to complex formulas, using the truth conditions below.\n* If <math>M,a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>M,b\\Vdash A</math>, for all formulas <math>A</math>.\n\nThe truth conditions for complex formulas are as follows.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\land B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\lor B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> or <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b,c((Rabc\\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,c\\Vdash B)</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash\\lnot A\\iff M,a^*\\nVdash A</math>\n\nA formula <math>A</math> holds in a model <math>M</math> just in case <math>M,0\\Vdash A</math>. A formula <math>A</math> holds on a frame <math>F</math> iff A holds in every model <math>(F,\\Vdash)</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid in a class of frames iff A holds on every frame in that class. \nThe class of all Routley\u2013Meyer frames satisfying the above conditions validates that relevance logic B. One can obtain Routley-Meyer frames for other relevance logics by placing appropriate restrictions on R and on *. These conditions are easier to state using some standard definitions. Let <math>Rabcd</math> be defined as <math>\\exists x(Rabx \\land Rxcd)</math>, and let <math>Ra(bc)d</math> be defined as <math>\\exists x(Rbcx \\land Raxd)</math>. Some of the frame conditions and the axioms they validate are the following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Frame condition\n! scope=\"col\" | Axiom\n|-\n!

They are included to show the flexibility of the Routley\u2013Meyer models.\n\n===Operational models===\nOperational models for negation-free fragments of relevance logics were developed by [[Alasdair Urquhart]] in his PhD thesis and in subsequent work. The intuitive idea behind the operational models is that points in a model are pieces of information, and combining information supporting a conditional with the information supporting its antecedent yields some information that supports the consequent. Since the operational models do not generally interpret negation, this section will consider only languages with a conditional, conjunction, and disjunction.\n\nAn operational frame <math>F</math> is a triple <math>(K,\\cdot,0)</math>, where  <math>K</math> is a non-empty set, <math>0\\in K</math>, and <math>\\cdot</math> is a binary operation on <math>K</math>. Frames have conditions, some of which may be dropped to model different logics. The conditions Urquhart proposed to model the conditional of the relevance logic R are the following.\n* <math>x\\cdot x=x</math>\n* <math>(x\\cdot y)\\cdot z=x\\cdot(y\\cdot z)</math>\n* <math>x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x</math>\n* <math>0\\cdot x=x</math>\nUnder these conditions, the operational frame is a join semilattice.\n\nAn operational model <math>M</math> is a frame <math>F</math> with a valuation <math>V</math> that maps pairs of points and atomic propositions to truth values, T or F. <math>V</math> can be extended to a valuation <math>\\Vdash</math> on complex formulas as follows.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash p \\iff V(a,p)=T</math>, for atomic propositions\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\land B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\lor B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> or <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b(M,b\\Vdash A\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nA formula <math>A</math> holds in a model <math>M</math> iff <math>M,0\\Vdash A</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid in a class of models <math>C</math> iff it holds in each model <math>M\\in C</math>.\n\nThe conditional fragment of R is sound and complete with respect to the class of semilattice models. The logic with conjunction and disjunction is properly stronger than the conditional, conjunction, disjunction fragment of R. In particular, the formula <math>(A\\to(B\\lor C))\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\to C)</math> is valid for the operational models but it is invalid in R. The logic generated by the operational models for R has a complete axiomatic proof system, due [[Kit Fine]] and to Gerald Charlwood. Charlwood also provided a natural deduction system for the logic, which he proved equivalent to the axiomatic system. Charlwood showed that his natural deduction system is equivalent to a system provided by [[Dag Prawitz]].\n\nThe operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of E by adding a non-empty set of worlds <math>W</math> and an accessibility relation <math>\\leq</math> on <math>W\\times W</math> to the frames. The accessibility relation is required to be reflexive and transitive, to capture the idea that E's conditional has an S4 necessity. The valuations then map triples of atomic propositions, points, and worlds to truth values. The truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following. \n* <math>M,a, w\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b, \\forall w'\\geq w(M,b, w'\\Vdash A\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b,w'\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nThe operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of T by adding a relation <math>\\leq</math> on <math>K\\times K</math>. The relation is required to obey the following conditions.\n* <math>0\\leq x</math>\n* If <math>x\\leq y</math> and <math>y\\leq z</math>, then <math>x\\leq z</math>\n* If <math>x\\leq y</math>, then <math>x\\cdot z\\leq y\\cdot z</math>\nThe truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b((a\\leq b\\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nThere are two ways to model the contraction-less relevance logics TW and RW  with the operational models. The first way is to drop the condition that <math>x\\cdot x=x</math>. The second way is to keep the semilattice conditions on frames and add a binary relation, <math>J</math>, of disjointness to the frame. For these models, the truth conditions for the conditional is changed to the following, with the addition of the ordering in the case of TW.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b((Jab \\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nUrquhart showed that the semilattice logic for R is properly stronger than the positive fragment of R. Lloyd Humberstone provided an enrichment of the operational models that permitted a different truth condition for disjunction. The resulting class of models generates exactly the positive fragment of R.\n\n===Algebraic models===\nSome relevance logics can be given algebraic models, such as the logic R. The algebraic structures for R are [[De Morgan algebra|de Morgan monoids]], which are sextuples <math>(D,\\land,\\lor,\\lnot,\\circ,e)</math> where\n* <math>(D,\\land,\\lor,\\lnot)</math> is a distributive [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] with a unary operation, <math>\\lnot</math> obeying the laws <math>\\lnot\\lnot x=x</math> and if <math>x\\leq y</math> then <math>\\lnot y\\leq \\lnot x</math>;\n* <math>e\\in D</math>, the binary operation <math>\\circ</math> is [[Commutative property|commutative]] (<math>x\\circ y=y\\circ x</math>) and [[Associative property|associative]] (<math>(x\\circ y)\\circ z=x\\circ (y\\circ z)</math>), and <math>e\\circ x=x</math>, i.e. <math>(D,\\circ,e)</math> is an [[Monoid#Commutative monoid|Abelian monoid]] with [[Identity element|identity]] <math>e</math>;\n* the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies <math>x\\circ(y\\lor z)=(x\\circ y)\\lor(x\\circ z)</math>;\n* <math>x\\leq x\\circ x</math>; and \n* if <math>x\\circ y\\leq z</math>, then <math>x\\circ\\lnot z\\leq \\lnot y</math>.\nThe operation <math>x\\to y</math> interpreting the conditional of R is defined as <math>\\lnot(x\\circ\\lnot y)</math>. \nA de Morgan monoid is a [[residuated lattice]], obeying the following residuation condition. \n: <math>x \\circ y\\leq z \\iff x\\leq y\\to z</math>\n\nAn interpretation <math>v</math> is a [[homomorphism]] from the propositional language to a de Morgan monoid <math>M</math> such that \n* <math>v(p)\\in D</math> for all atomic propositions, \n* <math>v(\\lnot A)=\\lnot v(A)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\lor B)=v(A)\\lor v(B)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\land B)=v(A)\\land v(B)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\to B)=v(A)\\to v(B)</math>\n\nGiven a de Morgan monoid <math>M</math> and an interpretation <math>v</math>, one can say that formula <math>A</math> holds on <math>v</math> just in case <math>e\\leq v(A)</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid just in case it holds on all interpretations on all de Morgan monoids. The logic R is sound and complete for de Morgan monoids.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Non sequitur (logic)]]\n* [[Relevant type system]], a [[substructural type system]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Alan Ross Anderson]] and [[Nuel Belnap]], 1975.

They may be viewed as a family of [[substructural logic|substructural]] or [[modal logic|modal]] logics. (It is generally, but not universally, called ''relevant logic'' by Australian [[logician]]s, and ''relevance logic'' by other English-speaking logicians.)\n\nRelevance logic aims to capture aspects of implication that are ignored by the \"[[material conditional|material implication]]\" operator in classical [[truth-functional logic]], namely the notion of relevance between antecedent and conditional of a true implication.  This idea is not new: [[C. I. Lewis]] was led to invent modal logic, and specifically [[strict implication]], on the grounds that classical logic grants [[paradoxes of material implication]] such as the principle that [[Vacuous truth|a falsehood implies any proposition]].  Hence \"if I'm a donkey, then two and two is four\" is true when translated as a material implication, yet it seems intuitively false since a true implication must tie the antecedent and consequent together by some notion of relevance. And whether or not I'm a donkey seems in no way relevant to whether two and two is four.\n\nHow does relevance logic formally capture a notion of relevance? In terms of a syntactical constraint for a [[propositional calculus]], it is necessary, but not sufficient, that premises and conclusion share [[atomic formula]]e (formulae that do not contain any [[logical connective]]s). In a [[predicate calculus]], relevance requires sharing of variables and constants between premises and conclusion. This can be ensured (along with stronger conditions) by, e.g., placing certain restrictions on the rules of a natural deduction system. In particular, a Fitch-style [[natural deduction]] can be adapted to accommodate relevance by introducing tags at the end of each line of an application of an inference indicating the premises relevant to the conclusion of the inference. [[Gentzen]]-style [[sequent calculus|sequent calculi]] can be modified by removing the weakening rules that allow for the introduction of arbitrary formulae on the right or left side of the [[sequent]]s.\n\nA notable feature of relevance logics is that they are [[paraconsistent logic]]s: the existence of a contradiction will not cause \"[[principle of explosion|explosion]]\".

It is axiomatized with the following axioms and rules.\n# <math>A\\to A</math>\n# <math>A\\land B\\to A</math>\n# <math>A\\land B\\to B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\land(A\\to C)\\to (A\\to B\\land C)</math>\n# <math>A\\to A\\lor B</math>\n# <math>B\\to A\\lor B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to C)\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\lor B\\to C)</math>\n# <math>A\\land(B\\lor C)\\to (A\\land B)\\lor(A\\land C)</math>\n# <math>\\lnot\\lnot A\\to A</math>\nThe rules are the following.\n# <math>A, A\\to B\\vdash B</math>\n# <math>A, B\\vdash A\\land B</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash (C\\to A)\\to(C\\to B)</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash (B\\to C)\\to(A\\to C)</math>\n# <math>A\\to B\\vdash \\lnot B\\to\\lnot A</math>\nStronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms.\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to (\\lnot B\\to\\lnot A)</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\to C)</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to((B\\to C)\\to(A\\to C))</math>\n# <math>(A\\to B)\\to((C\\to A)\\to(C\\to B))</math>\n# <math>(A\\to(A\\to B))\\to(A\\to B)</math>\n# <math>(A\\land (A\\to B))\\to B</math>\n# <math>(A\\to\\lnot A)\\to\\lnot A</math>\n# <math>(A\\to (B\\to C))\\to(B\\to(A\\to C))</math>\n# <math>A\\to((A\\to B)\\to B)</math>\n# <math>((A\\to A)\\to B)\\to B</math>\n# <math>A\\lor\\lnot A</math>\n# <math>A\\to(A\\to A)</math>\nThere are some notable logics stronger than B that can be obtained by adding axioms to B as follows.\n* For DW, add axiom 1.\n* For DJ, add axioms 1, 2.\n* For TW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4.\n* For RW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.\n* For T, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11.\n* For R, add axioms 1-11.\n* For E, add axioms 1-7, 10, 11, <math>((A\\to A)\\land(B\\to B)\\to C)\\to C</math>, and <math>\\Box A\\land \\Box B\\to \\Box (A\\land B)</math>, where <math>\\Box A</math> is defined as <math>(A\\to A)\\to A</math>.\n* For RM, add all the additional axioms.\n\n==Models==\n===Routley\u2013Meyer models===\nThe standard model theory for relevance logics is the Routley-Meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by [[Richard Sylvan|Richard Routley]] and [[Bob Meyer (logician)|Robert Meyer]]. A Routley\u2013Meyer frame F for a propositional language is a quadruple (W,R,*,0), where W is a non-empty set, R is a ternary relation on W, and * is a function from W to W, and <math>0\\in W</math>. A Routley-Meyer model M is a Routley-Meyer frame F together with a valuation, <math>\\Vdash</math>, that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point <math>a\\in W</math>. There are some conditions placed on Routley-Meyer frames. Define <math>a\\leq b</math> as <math>R0ab</math>.\n* <math>a\\leq a</math>.\n* If <math>a\\leq b</math>  and <math>b\\leq c</math>, then <math>a\\leq c</math>.\n* If <math>d\\leq a</math> and <math>Rabc</math>, then <math>Rdbc</math>.\n* <math>a^{**}=a</math>.\n* If <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>b^*\\leq a^*</math>.\nWrite <math>M,a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\nVdash A</math> to indicate that the formula <math>A</math> is true, or not true, respectively, at point <math>a</math> in <math>M</math>. \nOne final condition on Routley-Meyer models is the hereditariness condition.\n* If <math>M,a\\Vdash p</math> and <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>M,b\\Vdash p</math>, for all atomic propositions <math>p</math>.\nBy an inductive argument, hereditariness can be shown to extend to complex formulas, using the truth conditions below.\n* If <math>M,a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>a\\leq b</math>, then <math>M,b\\Vdash A</math>, for all formulas <math>A</math>.\n\nThe truth conditions for complex formulas are as follows.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\land B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\lor B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> or <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b,c((Rabc\\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,c\\Vdash B)</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash\\lnot A\\iff M,a^*\\nVdash A</math>\n\nA formula <math>A</math> holds in a model <math>M</math> just in case <math>M,0\\Vdash A</math>. A formula <math>A</math> holds on a frame <math>F</math> iff A holds in every model <math>(F,\\Vdash)</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid in a class of frames iff A holds on every frame in that class. \nThe class of all Routley\u2013Meyer frames satisfying the above conditions validates that relevance logic B. One can obtain Routley-Meyer frames for other relevance logics by placing appropriate restrictions on R and on *. These conditions are easier to state using some standard definitions. Let <math>Rabcd</math> be defined as <math>\\exists x(Rabx \\land Rxcd)</math>, and let <math>Ra(bc)d</math> be defined as <math>\\exists x(Rbcx \\land Raxd)</math>. Some of the frame conditions and the axioms they validate are the following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Frame condition\n! scope=\"col\" | Axiom\n|-\n!

They are included to show the flexibility of the Routley\u2013Meyer models.\n\n===Operational models===\nOperational models for negation-free fragments of relevance logics were developed by [[Alasdair Urquhart]] in his PhD thesis and in subsequent work. The intuitive idea behind the operational models is that points in a model are pieces of information, and combining information supporting a conditional with the information supporting its antecedent yields some information that supports the consequent. Since the operational models do not generally interpret negation, this section will consider only languages with a conditional, conjunction, and disjunction.\n\nAn operational frame <math>F</math> is a triple <math>(K,\\cdot,0)</math>, where  <math>K</math> is a non-empty set, <math>0\\in K</math>, and <math>\\cdot</math> is a binary operation on <math>K</math>. Frames have conditions, some of which may be dropped to model different logics. The conditions Urquhart proposed to model the conditional of the relevance logic R are the following.\n* <math>x\\cdot x=x</math>\n* <math>(x\\cdot y)\\cdot z=x\\cdot(y\\cdot z)</math>\n* <math>x\\cdot y=y\\cdot x</math>\n* <math>0\\cdot x=x</math>\nUnder these conditions, the operational frame is a join semilattice.\n\nAn operational model <math>M</math> is a frame <math>F</math> with a valuation <math>V</math> that maps pairs of points and atomic propositions to truth values, T or F. <math>V</math> can be extended to a valuation <math>\\Vdash</math> on complex formulas as follows.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash p \\iff V(a,p)=T</math>, for atomic propositions\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\land B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> and <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\lor B \\iff M, a\\Vdash A</math> or <math>M,a\\Vdash B</math>\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b(M,b\\Vdash A\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nA formula <math>A</math> holds in a model <math>M</math> iff <math>M,0\\Vdash A</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid in a class of models <math>C</math> iff it holds in each model <math>M\\in C</math>.\n\nThe conditional fragment of R is sound and complete with respect to the class of semilattice models. The logic with conjunction and disjunction is properly stronger than the conditional, conjunction, disjunction fragment of R. In particular, the formula <math>(A\\to(B\\lor C))\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\to C)</math> is valid for the operational models but it is invalid in R. The logic generated by the operational models for R has a complete axiomatic proof system, due [[Kit Fine]] and to Gerald Charlwood. Charlwood also provided a natural deduction system for the logic, which he proved equivalent to the axiomatic system. Charlwood showed that his natural deduction system is equivalent to a system provided by [[Dag Prawitz]].\n\nThe operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of E by adding a non-empty set of worlds <math>W</math> and an accessibility relation <math>\\leq</math> on <math>W\\times W</math> to the frames. The accessibility relation is required to be reflexive and transitive, to capture the idea that E's conditional has an S4 necessity. The valuations then map triples of atomic propositions, points, and worlds to truth values. The truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following. \n* <math>M,a, w\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b, \\forall w'\\geq w(M,b, w'\\Vdash A\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b,w'\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nThe operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of T by adding a relation <math>\\leq</math> on <math>K\\times K</math>. The relation is required to obey the following conditions.\n* <math>0\\leq x</math>\n* If <math>x\\leq y</math> and <math>y\\leq z</math>, then <math>x\\leq z</math>\n* If <math>x\\leq y</math>, then <math>x\\cdot z\\leq y\\cdot z</math>\nThe truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b((a\\leq b\\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nThere are two ways to model the contraction-less relevance logics TW and RW  with the operational models. The first way is to drop the condition that <math>x\\cdot x=x</math>. The second way is to keep the semilattice conditions on frames and add a binary relation, <math>J</math>, of disjointness to the frame. For these models, the truth conditions for the conditional is changed to the following, with the addition of the ordering in the case of TW.\n* <math>M,a\\Vdash A\\to B\\iff \\forall b((Jab \\land M,b\\Vdash A)\\Rightarrow M,a\\cdot b\\Vdash B)</math>\n\nUrquhart showed that the semilattice logic for R is properly stronger than the positive fragment of R. Lloyd Humberstone provided an enrichment of the operational models that permitted a different truth condition for disjunction. The resulting class of models generates exactly the positive fragment of R.\n\n===Algebraic models===\nSome relevance logics can be given algebraic models, such as the logic R. The algebraic structures for R are [[De Morgan algebra|de Morgan monoids]], which are sextuples <math>(D,\\land,\\lor,\\lnot,\\circ,e)</math> where\n* <math>(D,\\land,\\lor,\\lnot)</math> is a distributive [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] with a unary operation, <math>\\lnot</math> obeying the laws <math>\\lnot\\lnot x=x</math> and if <math>x\\leq y</math> then <math>\\lnot y\\leq \\lnot x</math>;\n* <math>e\\in D</math>, the binary operation <math>\\circ</math> is [[Commutative property|commutative]] (<math>x\\circ y=y\\circ x</math>) and [[Associative property|associative]] (<math>(x\\circ y)\\circ z=x\\circ (y\\circ z)</math>), and <math>e\\circ x=x</math>, i.e. <math>(D,\\circ,e)</math> is an [[Monoid#Commutative monoid|Abelian monoid]] with [[Identity element|identity]] <math>e</math>;\n* the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies <math>x\\circ(y\\lor z)=(x\\circ y)\\lor(x\\circ z)</math>;\n* <math>x\\leq x\\circ x</math>; and \n* if <math>x\\circ y\\leq z</math>, then <math>x\\circ\\lnot z\\leq \\lnot y</math>.\nThe operation <math>x\\to y</math> interpreting the conditional of R is defined as <math>\\lnot(x\\circ\\lnot y)</math>. \nA de Morgan monoid is a [[residuated lattice]], obeying the following residuation condition. \n: <math>x \\circ y\\leq z \\iff x\\leq y\\to z</math>\n\nAn interpretation <math>v</math> is a [[homomorphism]] from the propositional language to a de Morgan monoid <math>M</math> such that \n* <math>v(p)\\in D</math> for all atomic propositions, \n* <math>v(\\lnot A)=\\lnot v(A)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\lor B)=v(A)\\lor v(B)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\land B)=v(A)\\land v(B)</math>\n* <math>v(A\\to B)=v(A)\\to v(B)</math>\n\nGiven a de Morgan monoid <math>M</math> and an interpretation <math>v</math>, one can say that formula <math>A</math> holds on <math>v</math> just in case <math>e\\leq v(A)</math>. A formula <math>A</math> is valid just in case it holds on all interpretations on all de Morgan monoids. The logic R is sound and complete for de Morgan monoids.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Non sequitur (logic)]]\n* [[Relevant type system]], a [[substructural type system]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Alan Ross Anderson]] and [[Nuel Belnap]], 1975.

This placed the act at the forefront of the 1970s/1980s nascent [[Mod Revival]] movement.\n\nThe band released 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\" and \"[[Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?]]\" remained the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/jam |title=The Jam |work=The Guardian |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref> They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'', hit number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14105/jam/|title=J.A.M. \u2013 full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s [[beat music]], soul, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[psychedelic rock]], as well as 1970s punk and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] image. The band launched the career of [[Paul Weller]], who went on to form [[The Style Council]] and later had a successful solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions, and he played lead guitar, using a [[Rickenbacker 330]]. [[Bruce Foxton]] provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\", \"[[Going Underground]]\" and \"[[Town Called Malice]]\" mainly using a [[Rickenbacker 4001]] or a [[Fender Precision Bass]], as well as, on rare occasions, an [[Epiphone Rivoli]].\n\nJam biographer Sean Egan said of the Jam that they \"took social protest and cultural authenticity to the top of the charts.\"<ref>''Love With a Passion Called Hate: The Inside Story of The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-0-9545750-9-0}} p. 1</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1972\u20131976)===\nThe Jam formed in Woking, Surrey, England, in 1972. The line-up was fluid at this stage, consisting of [[Paul Weller]] on bass and lead vocals<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} p. 33</ref> together with various friends at [[Sheerwater Secondary School]]. They played their first gigs at Michael's, a local club. The line-up began to solidify in the mid-1970s with  Weller, guitarist/vocalist Steve Brookes and drummer [[Rick Buckler]]. In their early years, their sets consisted of covers of early American [[rock and roll]] songs by the likes of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' and became fascinated with Mod music and lifestyle. As he said later, \"I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing [[Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] covers. I bought a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar, a [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] GP 150 and tried to style my hair like [[Steve Marriott]]'s circa '66.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://underground-network.de/weller.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over ska musik.

Up to this point Weller had been playing bass and Foxton had been the band's second guitar player; he persuaded Foxton to take over bass duties and developed a combined lead/rhythm guitar style influenced by the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] as well as [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]]. The line-up of Weller, Foxton, and Buckler would persist until the end of The Jam's career.\n\nThroughout, the band were managed by Weller's father, John Weller, who then managed Paul's career until John died in 2009.<ref name=JohnWeller>{{cite news |author=Pierre Perrone |title=John Weller: Father of Paul Weller who managed his son for 30 years |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the following two years, the Jam gained a small following around London from playing minor gigs, becoming one of the new lights on the nascent punk scene. In many ways, however, they stood out from their punk peers. Though they shared an \"angry young men\" outlook, short hair, crushing volume and lightning-fast tempos, the Jam wore neatly tailored suits where others wore ripped clothes, played professionally where others were defiantly amateurish, and displayed clear 1960s rock influences where others were disdainful (at least ostensibly) of such music (which had been a major influence on the \"[[Arena rock|stadium rock]]\" and \"[[Progressive rock|prog rock]]\" of the 1970s). Indeed, the band were tagged by some journalists as \"revivalists\". They were signed to [[Polydor Records]] by Chris Parry in early 1977.\n\n===Early recordings (1977)===\nOn 29 April 1977, Polydor released the Jam's debut single, \"[[In the City (The Jam song)|In the City]]\", which charted in the Top 40 in the UK.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 65</ref> On 20 May, the band released their debut album [[In the City (The Jam album)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19770522/7502/|title=Official Albums Chart Top 60 |website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> The album, like those of [[the Clash]] and the [[Sex Pistols]], featured fast, loud and pointed songs. What set it apart from the records of those two bands was its more prevalent 1960s rock influences. The Jam covered [[Larry Williams]]'s \"[[Slow Down (Larry Williams song)|Slow Down]]\" (also covered by [[the Beatles]]) and the [[Batman Theme|theme song]] of the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'',<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 66</ref> which was somewhat of a standard for 1960s rock bands. Their originals revealed the influence of [[Motown Records]], [[the Beatles]] and [[the Who]].\n\nThe Jam had political lyrics, condemning [[police brutality]] (\"In the City\") and expansionist development (\"Bricks And Mortar\"). However, one of their most openly political songs, \"Time For Truth\", bemoaned the decline of the [[British Empire]] and expressed disparaging sentiments about \"Uncle Jimmy\" (the Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]) in no uncertain terms (\"Whatever happened to the great Empire?\" / \"I think it's time for truth, and the truth is you lost, Uncle Jimmy\"). These pro-Empire sentiments and ostentatious displays of the [[Union Flag]] began to earn the group the tag of \"[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\".\n\nAfter the non-LP single \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\" nearly reached the UK Top 10, The Jam, having achieved a notable and loyal following in such a short time,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 70</ref> were pressed to produce more material quickly. Their second album, ''[[This Is the Modern World]]'', was released later in 1977. Bruce Foxton, generally considered a lesser songwriter than Weller, contributed two songs to the LP (\"Don't Tell Them You're Sane\" and \"London Traffic\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-the-modern-world-mw0000312237 |title=The Jam: This is the Modern World |publisher=allmusic.com |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> both of which attracted criticism. His composing output gradually decreased, leaving Weller firmly established as the band's chief songwriter.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\n===''All Mod Cons'' (1978)===\nIn March 1978, the Jam released \"News of the World\", a non-album single that was both written and sung by Foxton. It charted at No.&nbsp;27 in the UK, and was the band's second biggest hit to date. This was the only Foxton solo composition to be released as a Jam A-side. When the band went back into the studio to record a third album of primarily Foxton contributions, their songs were dismissed by producers as poor, and they held off recording an album in hopes that Weller would once again find inspiration. \"News of the World\" is now used in the opening theme of the BBC television show ''[[Mock the Week]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b085z8kv|title=Mock the Week: Christmas Special |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=14 December 2016 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nReturning to his hometown of Woking, Weller spent much of his time listening to albums by [[the Kinks]] and coming up with new songs. The Jam released their next single, the double A-side \"[[David Watts (Ray Davies song)|David Watts]]\"/\"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\". \"David Watts\" was a cover of a Kinks song, throughout which Weller and Foxton traded lead vocals. \"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\" was a Weller original. One of their hardest and most intense songs, Weller cursed the violent thugs that plagued the punk rock scene over a taut two-chord figure. It became their most successful 7\" since \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\".\n\nIt was not until their next single, \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", that the Jam really regained their former critical acclaim. The song was a dramatic account of being mugged by thugs who \"smelled of pubs and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] and too many right-wing meetings\". Around this time, The Jam slimmed their team of two producers to one, [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]], who helped develop the group's sound with harmonised guitars and acoustic textures. In 1978, the Jam released their third LP, ''[[All Mod Cons]]'', which included three previously released tracks among the 12 in total: \"David Watts\", \"'A' Bomb In Wardour Street\", and \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\". (It also contained two songs Polydor had previously rejected for single release, the manic \"Billy Hunt\" and the acoustic ballad \"English Rose\".)\n\n===''Setting Sons'' & ''Sound Affects'' (1979\u20131981)===\nFollowing two successful and critically acclaimed non-LP singles, \"[[Strange Town]]\" and \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/paul-weller/news/paul-weller-three-best-songs-the-jam-changingman/ |title=Paul Weller: I've Written Three Perfect Ssongs in my Life |publisher=radiox.co.uk |date=10 June 2015|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> the band released \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\" in advance of their new album. It became their first top 10, rising to No.&nbsp;3 on the UK charts. November 1979 saw the release of the ''[[Setting Sons]]'' album, another UK hit, and their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album began life as a [[concept album]]<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 131</ref> about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme. Many of the songs had political overtones; \"The Eton Rifles\" was inspired by skirmishes between demonstrators on a ''Right to Work March'' \u2013 a campaign initiated by the left-wing [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] \u2013 and pupils from [[Eton College]]; \"Little Boy Soldiers\" was an anti-war multi-movement piece in the vein of [[Ray Davies]]. Another notable song from the album was Bruce Foxton's \"Smithers-Jones\", originally a b-side to \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\". The song is almost unanimously considered to be his greatest contribution to The Jam. Recorded with electric rock instrumentation for the single release, \"Smithers-Jones\" was given a complete makeover for the ''Setting Sons'' album with a string arrangement.\n\nThe band's first single of 1980 was intended to be \"[[Dreams of Children]]\", which combined bleak lyrics lamenting the loss of childhood optimism with hard-edged, psychedelic instrumental backing and production. Due to a labelling error, however, the A- and B-sides of the single were reversed, resulting in the more conventional \"[[Going Underground]]\", the single's planned flipside, getting much more airplay and attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/dreams-of-children-mt0052556220 |title=The Jam: Dreams of Children |publisher=allmusic.com |date=12 June 2013|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> As a result, only \"Going Underground\" was initially listed on the charts, although the single was eventually officially recognised (and listed) as a double A-side by the time the release reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK. When promoting the album in the United States, the group appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', performing \"[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave]]\", a cover of the hit song by the Motown girl group [[Martha and the Vandellas]]. They also appeared on the short-lived American sketch comedy series ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', playing the songs \"Private Hell\" and \u201cStart\u201d.\n\n''[[Sound Affects]]'' was released in November 1980. Paul Weller said that he was influenced by [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title = Paul Weller \u2013 The Changing Man|last = Hewitt|first = Paolo|publisher = corgi books|year = 2008|isbn = 9780552156097|location = |pages = 132}}</ref> also. Indeed, several of the songs recall ''Revolver''-era swirling psychedelia, such as \"Monday\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", and the acoustic \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\". According to Weller he wrote \"That's Entertainment\", a bitter slice-of-life commentary on the drudgery of modern working-class life, in around 15 minutes upon returning inebriated from the pub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4613|title=That's Entertainment by The Jam Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> Despite being only available as an import single, it peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the UK charts, an unprecedented feat. It is now arguably The Jam's most celebrated song. Despite the group's lack of commercial success in America, it even made American magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|list of the 500 greatest songs of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: The Jam--\"That's Entertainment\" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=4 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619110213/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Start!]]\", released before the album, became another No.&nbsp;1 single.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 148</ref> It had a very similar bass line, rhythm guitar and guitar solo to The Beatles' ''Revolver'' cut \"[[Taxman]]\", but was arranged as an otherwise completely different song. Some contemporary American R&B influence, including Michael Jackson, show up in Buckler's driving beats that power the album (such as on \"But I'm Different Now\"), and most obviously in Foxton's funk-influenced bassline in \"Pretty Green\". The album also reveals influences of post-punk groups such as [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[XTC]], [[Joy Division]], and [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]. The album was a No.&nbsp;2 hit in the UK and peaked at No.&nbsp;72 on the US Billboard charts, their most successful American album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6911760/the-jam/chart |title=Billboard 200 |publisher=billboard.com |date=9 November 2014|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''The Gift'' and break-up (1981\u20131982)===\nTwo non-LP singles, \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" and \"[[Absolute Beginners (The Jam)|Absolute Beginners]]\", abandoned the psychedelic pop of ''Sound Affects''; \"Absolute Beginners\" (named after a [[Absolute Beginners (novel)|cult novel of the same title]]) had a more R&B-flavoured sound, and \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" was influenced by [[post-punk]] music. \"Absolute Beginners\" would reach No.&nbsp;4 on the UK charts.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 277}}</ref> While missing the US pop charts, its video received regular rotation on budding cable channel [[MTV]]. \"Funeral Pyre\" is built around Buckler's drumming, and aside from the ''Sound Affects'' track \"Music for the Last Couple\", is the only song in the group's catalogue that carries a joint Buckler/Foxton/Weller writing credit. \"Funeral Pyre\" and \"Music for the Last Couple\" are the only songs for which Buckler receives any writing credit.\n\nThe 1982 release ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'' \u2013 the band's final studio LP \u2013 was a massive commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts while spending an unprecedented 16 weeks on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It featured several soul, funk, and R&B-stylised songs; most notably the No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Town Called Malice]]\", which boasts a Motown-style bassline somewhat reminiscent of [[The Supremes]]' \"You Can't Hurry Love\". The song included work by [[Keith Thomas (saxophonist)|Keith Thomas]] and [[Steve Nichol]], who later became well known as members of the R&B groups [[Legacy (R&B band)|Legacy]] and [[Loose Ends (band)|Loose Ends]] respectively. \"Town Called Malice\", a reality-based tale about dealing with hardship in a small, downtrodden English town, is one of a handful of Jam songs Weller still performs (along with \"[[That's Entertainment (song)|That's Entertainment]]\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", \"Strange Town\", \"Art School\", \"Start!\" and \"In the Crowd\"){{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. When \"Town Called Malice\" reached number one the group had the honour of performing both it and its double A-side, \"Precious\" on [[Top of the Pops]] \u2013 the only other band to be accorded this honour being the Beatles. After the string-laden soul ballad \"[[The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had to Swallow)]]\" peaked at No.&nbsp;2, the band followed with their finale and another No.&nbsp;1, \"[[Beat Surrender]]\". Both singles featured [[Tracie Young]] on vocals; a few months later, she also guested on [[The Style Council]]'s debut single \"[[Speak Like a Child (song)|Speak Like a Child]]\".\n\nTo universal surprise, on 30 October 1982 Weller announced his intention to disband The Jam after a short concert tour of the UK had been completed. They also made their final appearances on ''Top of the Pops'' and ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' to promote \"Beat Surrender\". The tour included five consecutive nights at the [[Wembley Arena]], all of which sold out within twenty minutes of tickets becoming available. The last date on the original itinerary had been scheduled for 9 December 1982 at [[Guildford Civic Hall]], close to the band's hometown of Woking. However, due to ticket demand, an additional date was added at the [[Brighton Conference Centre]] on 11 December 1982 for their last performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Simon|title=THE JAM: DECEMBER 11TH 1982 BY SIMON WELLS|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/the-jam-december-11th-1982-by-simon-wells/|website=Modculture|accessdate=20 December 2016|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to split was solely Weller's. Explaining at the time that he disliked the idea of continuing for as long as possible simply because they were successful, he later told the Daily Mirror in advance of a 2015 Sky documentary on the band, \"I wanted to end it to see what else I was capable of, and I'm still sure we stopped at the right time.

''NME'' reported at the time that, while Foxton and Weller apparently reconciled no later than 2010, \"Weller and Buckler are said to have not been in the same room since their band\u2019s demise.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Britton|first1=Luke Morgan|title=The Jam drummer fails to attend the band\u2019s new London exhibition|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/the-jam-4-1225197|website=NME|accessdate=20 December 2016|date=26 June 2015}}</ref> The exhibition proved to be very popular and was extended until 27 September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jam: About the Young Idea|url=http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/visual-arts/the-jam-about-the-young-idea|publisher=Somerset House|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> The exhibition was curated by Tory Turk, Nicky Weller (Paul's sister) and Russell Reader.\n\n''About The Young Idea'' at the [[Cunard Building]] in [[Liverpool]] was a much larger interactive experience, which picked up on the overwhelming success of the exhibition held at Somerset House.

This placed the act at the forefront of the 1970s/1980s nascent [[Mod Revival]] movement.\n\nThe band released 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\" and \"[[Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?]]\" remained the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/jam |title=The Jam |work=The Guardian |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref> They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'', hit number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14105/jam/|title=J.A.M. - full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s [[beat music]], soul, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[psychedelic rock]], as well as 1970s punk and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] image. The band launched the career of [[Paul Weller]], who went on to form [[The Style Council]] and later had a successful solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions, and he played lead guitar, using a [[Rickenbacker 330]]. [[Bruce Foxton]] provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\", \"[[Going Underground]]\" and \"[[Town Called Malice]]\" mainly using a [[Rickenbacker 4001]] or a [[Fender Precision Bass]], as well as, on rare occasions, an [[Epiphone Rivoli]].\n\nJam biographer Sean Egan said of the Jam that they \"took social protest and cultural authenticity to the top of the charts.\"<ref>''Love With a Passion Called Hate: The Inside Story of The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-0-9545750-9-0}} p. 1</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1972\u20131976)===\nThe Jam formed in Woking, Surrey, England, in 1972. The line-up was fluid at this stage, consisting of [[Paul Weller]] on bass and lead vocals<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} p. 33</ref> together with various friends at [[Sheerwater Secondary School]]. They played their first gigs at Michael's, a local club. The line-up began to solidify in the mid-1970s with  Weller, guitarist/vocalist Steve Brookes and drummer [[Rick Buckler]]. In their early years, their sets consisted of covers of early American [[rock and roll]] songs by the likes of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' and became fascinated with Mod music and lifestyle. As he said later, \"I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing [[Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] covers. I bought a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar, a [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] GP 150 and tried to style my hair like [[Steve Marriott]]'s circa '66.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://underground-network.de/weller.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over ska musik.

Up to this point Weller had been playing bass and Foxton had been the band's second guitar player; he persuaded Foxton to take over bass duties and developed a combined lead/rhythm guitar style influenced by the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] as well as [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]]. The line-up of Weller, Foxton, and Buckler would persist until the end of The Jam's career.\n\nThroughout, the band were managed by Weller's father, John Weller, who then managed Paul's career until John died in 2009.<ref name=JohnWeller>{{cite news |author=Pierre Perrone |title=John Weller: Father of Paul Weller who managed his son for 30 years |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the following two years, the Jam gained a small following around London from playing minor gigs, becoming one of the new lights on the nascent punk scene. In many ways, however, they stood out from their punk peers. Though they shared an \"angry young men\" outlook, short hair, crushing volume and lightning-fast tempos, the Jam wore neatly tailored suits where others wore ripped clothes, played professionally where others were defiantly amateurish, and displayed clear 1960s rock influences where others were disdainful (at least ostensibly) of such music (which had been a major influence on the \"[[Arena rock|stadium rock]]\" and \"[[Progressive rock|prog rock]]\" of the 1970s). Indeed, the band were tagged by some journalists as \"revivalists\". They were signed to [[Polydor Records]] by Chris Parry in early 1977.\n\n===Early recordings (1977)===\nOn 29 April 1977, Polydor released the Jam's debut single, \"[[In the City (The Jam song)|In the City]]\", which charted in the Top 40 in the UK.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 65</ref> On 20 May, the band released their debut album [[In the City (The Jam album)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19770522/7502/|title=Official Albums Chart Top 60 |website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> The album, like those of [[the Clash]] and the [[Sex Pistols]], featured fast, loud and pointed songs. What set it apart from the records of those two bands was its more prevalent 1960s rock influences. The Jam covered [[Larry Williams]]'s \"[[Slow Down (Larry Williams song)|Slow Down]]\" (also covered by [[the Beatles]]) and the [[Batman Theme|theme song]] of the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'',<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 66</ref> which was somewhat of a standard for 1960s rock bands. Their originals revealed the influence of [[Motown Records]], [[the Beatles]] and [[the Who]].\n\nThe Jam had political lyrics, condemning [[police brutality]] (\"In the City\") and expansionist development (\"Bricks And Mortar\"). However, one of their most openly political songs, \"Time For Truth\", bemoaned the decline of the [[British Empire]] and expressed disparaging sentiments about \"Uncle Jimmy\" (the Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]) in no uncertain terms (\"Whatever happened to the great Empire?\" / \"I think it's time for truth, and the truth is you lost, Uncle Jimmy\"). These pro-Empire sentiments and ostentatious displays of the [[Union Flag]] began to earn the group the tag of \"[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\".\n\nAfter the non-LP single \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\" nearly reached the UK Top 10, The Jam, having achieved a notable and loyal following in such a short time,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 70</ref> were pressed to produce more material quickly. Their second album, ''[[This Is the Modern World]]'', was released later in 1977. Bruce Foxton, generally considered a lesser songwriter than Weller, contributed two songs to the LP (\"Don't Tell Them You're Sane\" and \"London Traffic\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-the-modern-world-mw0000312237 |title=The Jam: This is the Modern World |publisher=allmusic.com |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> both of which attracted criticism. His composing output gradually decreased, leaving Weller firmly established as the band's chief songwriter.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} pp. 94-95</ref>\n\n===''All Mod Cons'' (1978)===\nIn March 1978, the Jam released \"News of the World\", a non-album single that was both written and sung by Foxton. It charted at No.&nbsp;27 in the UK, and was the band's second biggest hit to date. This was the only Foxton solo composition to be released as a Jam A-side. When the band went back into the studio to record a third album of primarily Foxton contributions, their songs were dismissed by producers as poor, and they held off recording an album in hopes that Weller would once again find inspiration. \"News of the World\" is now used in the opening theme of the BBC television show ''[[Mock the Week]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b085z8kv|title=Mock the Week: Christmas Special |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=14 December 2016 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nReturning to his hometown of Woking, Weller spent much of his time listening to albums by [[the Kinks]] and coming up with new songs. The Jam released their next single, the double A-side \"[[David Watts (Ray Davies song)|David Watts]]\"/\"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\". \"David Watts\" was a cover of a Kinks song, throughout which Weller and Foxton traded lead vocals. \"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\" was a Weller original. One of their hardest and most intense songs, Weller cursed the violent thugs that plagued the punk rock scene over a taut two-chord figure. It became their most successful 7\" since \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\".\n\nIt was not until their next single, \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", that the Jam really regained their former critical acclaim. The song was a dramatic account of being mugged by thugs who \"smelled of pubs and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] and too many right-wing meetings\". Around this time, The Jam slimmed their team of two producers to one, [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]], who helped develop the group's sound with harmonised guitars and acoustic textures. In 1978, the Jam released their third LP, ''[[All Mod Cons]]'', which included three previously released tracks among the 12 in total: \"David Watts\", \"'A' Bomb In Wardour Street\", and \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\". (It also contained two songs Polydor had previously rejected for single release, the manic \"Billy Hunt\" and the acoustic ballad \"English Rose\".)\n\n===''Setting Sons'' & ''Sound Affects'' (1979\u20131981)===\nFollowing two successful and critically acclaimed non-LP singles, \"[[Strange Town]]\" and \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/paul-weller/news/paul-weller-three-best-songs-the-jam-changingman/ |title=Paul Weller: I've Written Three Perfect Ssongs in my Life |publisher=radiox.co.uk |date=10 June 2015|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> the band released \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\" in advance of their new album. It became their first top 10, rising to No.&nbsp;3 on the UK charts. November 1979 saw the release of the ''[[Setting Sons]]'' album, another UK hit, and their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album began life as a [[concept album]]<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 131</ref> about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme. Many of the songs had political overtones; \"The Eton Rifles\" was inspired by skirmishes between demonstrators on a ''Right to Work March'' \u2013 a campaign initiated by the left-wing [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] \u2013 and pupils from [[Eton College]]; \"Little Boy Soldiers\" was an anti-war multi-movement piece in the vein of [[Ray Davies]]. Another notable song from the album was Bruce Foxton's \"Smithers-Jones\", originally a b-side to \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\". The song is almost unanimously considered to be his greatest contribution to The Jam. Recorded with electric rock instrumentation for the single release, \"Smithers-Jones\" was given a complete makeover for the ''Setting Sons'' album with a string arrangement.\n\nThe band's first single of 1980 was intended to be \"[[Dreams of Children]]\", which combined bleak lyrics lamenting the loss of childhood optimism with hard-edged, psychedelic instrumental backing and production. Due to a labelling error, however, the A- and B-sides of the single were reversed, resulting in the more conventional \"[[Going Underground]]\", the single's planned flipside, getting much more airplay and attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/dreams-of-children-mt0052556220 |title=The Jam: Dreams of Children |publisher=allmusic.com |date=12 June 2013|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> As a result, only \"Going Underground\" was initially listed on the charts, although the single was eventually officially recognised (and listed) as a double A-side by the time the release reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK. When promoting the album in the United States, the group appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', performing \"[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave]]\", a cover of the hit song by the Motown girl group [[Martha and the Vandellas]]. They also appeared on the short-lived American sketch comedy series ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', playing the songs \"Private Hell\" and \u201cStart\u201d.\n\n''[[Sound Affects]]'' was released in November 1980. Paul Weller said that he was influenced by [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title = Paul Weller - The Changing Man|last = Hewitt|first = Paolo|publisher = corgi books|year = 2008|isbn = 9780552156097|location = |pages = 132}}</ref> also. Indeed, several of the songs recall ''Revolver''-era swirling psychedelia, such as \"Monday\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", and the acoustic \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\". According to Weller he wrote \"That's Entertainment\", a bitter slice-of-life commentary on the drudgery of modern working-class life, in around 15 minutes upon returning inebriated from the pub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4613|title=That's Entertainment by The Jam Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> Despite being only available as an import single, it peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the UK charts, an unprecedented feat. It is now arguably The Jam's most celebrated song. Despite the group's lack of commercial success in America, it even made American magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|list of the 500 greatest songs of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: The Jam--\"That's Entertainment\" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=4 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619110213/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Start!]]\", released before the album, became another No.&nbsp;1 single.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 148</ref> It had a very similar bass line, rhythm guitar and guitar solo to The Beatles' ''Revolver'' cut \"[[Taxman]]\", but was arranged as an otherwise completely different song. Some contemporary American R&B influence, including Michael Jackson, show up in Buckler's driving beats that power the album (such as on \"But I'm Different Now\"), and most obviously in Foxton's funk-influenced bassline in \"Pretty Green\". The album also reveals influences of post-punk groups such as [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[XTC]], [[Joy Division]], and [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]. The album was a No.&nbsp;2 hit in the UK and peaked at No.&nbsp;72 on the US Billboard charts, their most successful American album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6911760/the-jam/chart |title=Billboard 200 |publisher=billboard.com |date=9 November 2014|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''The Gift'' and break-up (1981\u20131982)===\nTwo non-LP singles, \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" and \"[[Absolute Beginners (The Jam)|Absolute Beginners]]\", abandoned the psychedelic pop of ''Sound Affects''; \"Absolute Beginners\" (named after a [[Absolute Beginners (novel)|cult novel of the same title]]) had a more R&B-flavoured sound, and \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" was influenced by [[post-punk]] music. \"Absolute Beginners\" would reach No.&nbsp;4 on the UK charts.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 277}}</ref> While missing the US pop charts, its video received regular rotation on budding cable channel [[MTV]]. \"Funeral Pyre\" is built around Buckler's drumming, and aside from the ''Sound Affects'' track \"Music for the Last Couple\", is the only song in the group's catalogue that carries a joint Buckler/Foxton/Weller writing credit. \"Funeral Pyre\" and \"Music for the Last Couple\" are the only songs for which Buckler receives any writing credit.\n\nThe 1982 release ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'' \u2013 the band's final studio LP \u2013 was a massive commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts while spending an unprecedented 16 weeks on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It featured several soul, funk, and R&B-stylised songs; most notably the No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Town Called Malice]]\", which boasts a Motown-style bassline somewhat reminiscent of [[The Supremes]]' \"You Can't Hurry Love\". The song included work by [[Keith Thomas (saxophonist)|Keith Thomas]] and [[Steve Nichol]], who later became well known as members of the R&B groups [[Legacy (R&B band)|Legacy]] and [[Loose Ends (band)|Loose Ends]] respectively. \"Town Called Malice\", a reality-based tale about dealing with hardship in a small, downtrodden English town, is one of a handful of Jam songs Weller still performs (along with \"[[That's Entertainment (song)|That's Entertainment]]\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", \"Strange Town\", \"Art School\", \"Start!\" and \"In the Crowd\"){{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. When \"Town Called Malice\" reached number one the group had the honour of performing both it and its double A-side, \"Precious\" on [[Top of the Pops]] \u2013 the only other band to be accorded this honour being the Beatles. After the string-laden soul ballad \"[[The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had to Swallow)]]\" peaked at No.&nbsp;2, the band followed with their finale and another No.&nbsp;1, \"[[Beat Surrender]]\". Both singles featured [[Tracie Young]] on vocals; a few months later, she also guested on [[The Style Council]]'s debut single \"[[Speak Like a Child (song)|Speak Like a Child]]\".\n\nTo universal surprise, on 30 October 1982 Weller announced his intention to disband The Jam after a short concert tour of the UK had been completed. They also made their final appearances on ''Top of the Pops'' and ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' to promote \"Beat Surrender\". The tour included five consecutive nights at the [[Wembley Arena]], all of which sold out within twenty minutes of tickets becoming available. The last date on the original itinerary had been scheduled for 9 December 1982 at [[Guildford Civic Hall]], close to the band's hometown of Woking. However, due to ticket demand, an additional date was added at the [[Brighton Conference Centre]] on 11 December 1982 for their last performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Simon|title=THE JAM: DECEMBER 11TH 1982 BY SIMON WELLS|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/the-jam-december-11th-1982-by-simon-wells/|website=Modculture|accessdate=20 December 2016|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to split was solely Weller's. Explaining at the time that he disliked the idea of continuing for as long as possible simply because they were successful, he later told the Daily Mirror in advance of a 2015 Sky documentary on the band, \"I wanted to end it to see what else I was capable of, and I'm still sure we stopped at the right time.

Foxton's solo album ''Touch Sensitive'' followed in 1984, but subsequent singles \"This Is The Way\", \"It Makes Me Wonder\" and \"SOS: My Imagination\" failed to enter the Top 40.

Smith's poem was published in ''The Examiner'' three weeks after Shelley's, on February 1, 1818. Both poems explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.\n\nIn antiquity, Ozymandias ({{lang|grc|\u1f48\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2}}) was a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]. Shelley began writing his poem in 1817, soon after the [[British Museum]]'s announcement that they had acquired a large fragment of a statue of Ramesses II from the 13th century [[BCE]]; some scholars believe Shelley was inspired by the acquisition. The {{convert|7.25|ST|t kg|adj=on}} fragment of the statue's head and torso had been removed in 1816 from the [[mortuary temple]] of Ramesses (the [[Ramesseum]]) at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by the Italian adventurer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]]. It had been expected to arrive in London in 1818, but did not arrive until 1821.<ref>British Museum.

At this time, members of Shelley's literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, [[John Keats]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] wrote competing sonnets on the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work.\" In the poem Diodorus becomes \"a traveller from an antique land.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siculus|first1=Diodorus|title=Bibliotheca Historica|location=1.47.4|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+1.47&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}</ref>\n\nThe two poems were later printed in Leigh Hunt's ''The Examiner'',<ref name=\"Shelley1818\" /> a weekly paper published by Leigh's brother [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]] in London.

Smith's poem was published in ''The Examiner'' three weeks after Shelley's, on February 1, 1818. Both poems explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.\n\nIn antiquity, Ozymandias ({{lang|grc|\u1f48\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2}}) was a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]. Shelley began writing his poem in 1817, soon after the [[British Museum]]'s announcement that they had acquired a large fragment of a statue of Ramesses II from the 13th century [[BCE]]; some scholars believe Shelley was inspired by the acquisition. The {{convert|7.25|ST|t kg|adj=on}} fragment of the statue's head and torso had been removed in 1816 from the [[mortuary temple]] of Ramesses (the [[Ramesseum]]) at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by the Italian adventurer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]]. It had been expected to arrive in London in 1818, but did not arrive until 1821.<ref>British Museum.

At this time, members of Shelley's literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, [[John Keats]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] wrote competing sonnets on the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work.\" In the poem Diodorus becomes \"a traveller from an antique land.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siculus|first1=Diodorus|title=Bibliotheca Historica|location=1.47.4|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+1.47&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}</ref>\n\nThe two poems were later printed in Leigh Hunt's ''The Examiner'',<ref name=\"Shelley1818\" /> a weekly paper published by Leigh's brother [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]] in London.

Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N.

In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N.

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana).

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

In the south, Blacks were harshly treated, and were not expected to be anything other than a slave. This theory created by society allowed for Blacks to move full force into the movement.

Many [[blues]] singers migrated from the [[Mississippi Delta]] to Chicago to escape racial discrimination. [[Muddy Waters]], [[Chester Burnett]], and [[Buddy Guy]] are among the most well-known blues artists who migrated to Chicago. Great Delta-born pianist [[Eddie Boyd]] told ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, \"I thought of coming to Chicago where I could get away from some of that racism and where I would have an opportunity to, well, do something with my talent....

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

Before the Great Migration, an estimated 1.1% to 1.6% of Cleveland's population was African American.<ref name=GibsonJung>Gibson, Campbell, and Kay Jung. \"Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals by Race, 1790 to 1990, and by Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, for Large Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States.\" U.S. Census Bureau, February 2005.</ref> By 1920, 4.3% of Cleveland's population was African American.<ref name=GibsonJung /> The number of African Americans in Cleveland continued to rise over the next 20 years of the Great Migration.\n\nOther northeastern and midwestern industrial cities, such as Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Omaha, also had dramatic increases in their African-American populations. By the 1920s, New York's [[Harlem]] became a center of black cultural life, influenced by the American migrants as well as new immigrants from the [[Caribbean]] area.\n\nSecond-tier industrial cities that were destinations for numerous black migrants were [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Boston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Indianapolis]], and smaller industrial cities such as [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]],  [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. People tended to take the cheapest rail ticket possible and go to areas where they had relatives and friends. For example, many people from [[Mississippi]] moved directly north by train to Chicago, from [[Alabama]] to Cleveland and Detroit, from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to [[New York City]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Philadelphia]], and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Denver]], and [[Seattle]].\n\n=== Discrimination and working conditions ===\n[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], New York City.<ref>[http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/abrieflookatbronx.html A Brief Look at The Bronx], Bronx Historical Society.

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries. Between 1910 and 1920, the number of blacks employed in industry nearly doubled from 500,000 to 901,000.<ref name=\"archives.gov\" /> After the [[Great Depression]], more advances took place after workers in the steel and meatpacking industries organized into [[labor union]]s in the 1930s and 1940s, under the interracial [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). The unions ended the segregation of many jobs, and African Americans began to advance into more skilled jobs and supervisory positions previously informally reserved for whites.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1960, the number of blacks in managerial and administrative occupations doubled, along with the number of blacks in white-collar occupations, while the number of black agricultural workers in 1960 fell to one-fourth of what it was in 1940.<ref>{{citation|last=Miller|first=Aurelia Toyer|title=The Social and Economic Status of the Black Population in the U.S.: An Historical View, 1790\u20131978|journal=[[The Review of Black Political Economy]]|volume=10|issue=3|year=1980|pages=314\u2013318|doi=10.1007/bf02689658}}</ref> Also, between 1936 and 1959, black income relative to white income more than doubled in various skilled trades.<ref>{{citation|last=Ashenfelter|first=Orley|author-link=Orley Ashenfelter|title=Changes in Labor Market Discrimination Over Time|journal=[[The Journal of Human Resources]]|volume=5|issue=4|pages=403\u2013430|year=1970|doi=10.2307/144999|jstor=144999}}</ref> Encountering very little [[employment discrimination]], blacks had higher [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation rates]] than whites in every [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] from 1890 to 1950.<ref>{{citation|title=Historical Statistics of the United States: From Colonial Times to 1957|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/1208?start_page=83|year=1960|place=Washington, D.C.|page=72}}</ref> As a result of these advancements, the percentage of black families living below the poverty line declined from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 and to 30 percent by 1970.<ref>{{citation|last1=Thernstrom|first1=Stephan|last2=Thernstrom|first2=Abigail|author-link1=Stephan Thernstrom|author-link2=Abigail Thernstrom|title=America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible|place=New York|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=1997|page=232}}</ref>\n\nPopulations increased so rapidly among both African-American migrants and new European immigrants that there were housing shortages in most major cities. With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price. In the long term, the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin Fox |last=Gotham |title=Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=43 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=291\u2013317 |jstor=1389798 |doi=10.2307/1389798 }}</ref>\n\nMigrants going to [[Albany, New York]] found poor living conditions and employment opportunities, but also higher wages and better schools and social services.

The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society. As they lived and worked more closely with European Americans, the divide became increasingly indefinite. This period marked the transition for many African Americans from lifestyles as rural farmers to urban industrial workers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black exodus : the great migration from the American South|date=1991|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Harrison, Alferdteen.|isbn=9781604738216|location=Jackson|oclc=775352334}}</ref>\n\nThis migration gave birth to a cultural boom in cities such as Chicago and New York. In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N. (1999). \"The Origins of Soul Food in Black Urban Identity: Chicago, 1915-1947,\" ''American Studies International.''

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]] as interfering with \"the natural right of workers to move from place to place at their own discretion\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=White rage : the unspoken truth of our racial

southerners were less concerned, as mechanization of agriculture in the late 1930s had resulted in another labor surplus so southern planters put up less resistance.<ref name=Reich />\n\n== In popular

Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N.

In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N.

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, [[chain migration]] played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Migration: The African American Exodus from The South|first=Dan |last=Kopf|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-great-migration-the-african-american-exodus/|website = Priceonomics|date=January 28, 2016|access-date = 2016-02-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics, tensions and employment sectors ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\nWhen the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed in 1863, less than eight percent of the African-American population lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States.<ref name=Migrations>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html|title=Migrations \u2013 The African-American Mosaic Exhibition \u2013 Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=United States Bureau of the|last=Census|date=23 July 2010|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> This began to change over the next decade; by 1880, a migration was underway to Kansas.

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

Principally, many blacks were assuming the jobs of white men who went to go fight in World War I. As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by black men who were willing to work for far less.<ref name=\":02\" /> By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured.

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

By the 1920s, New York's [[Harlem]] became a center of black cultural life, influenced by the American migrants as well as new immigrants from the [[Caribbean]] area.\n\nSecond-tier industrial cities that were destinations for numerous black migrants were [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Boston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Indianapolis]], and smaller industrial cities such as [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]],  [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. People tended to take the cheapest rail ticket possible and go to areas where they had relatives and friends. For example, many people from [[Mississippi]] moved directly north by train to Chicago, from [[Alabama]] to Cleveland and Detroit, from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to [[New York City]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Philadelphia]], and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Denver]], and [[Seattle]].\n\n=== Discrimination and working conditions ===\n[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], New York City.<ref>[http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/abrieflookatbronx.html A Brief Look at The Bronx], Bronx Historical Society.

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries.

With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price.

Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society.

In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N.

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B.

For criticism of using \"Germans\" see for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}. Compare also to the influential old definition in German by the Grimm brothers for \"der Germane\" ({{harvcoltxt|Grimm|Grimm}}).}} They are also associated with [[Germanic languages]], which many of them probably spoke.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=3}}: \"There was a time where it was possible to say: 'The name Germanic peoples refers to those ethnic tribes who spoke a Germanic language'.\" {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|p=47}}: \"F\u00fcr die Zusammenarbeit der Disziplinen ist festzuhalten, dass die von der Philologie rekonstruierten Sprachen, wie eben das Germanische, Abstraktionen sind...\". {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"...there was always a problem with early Germanic because only fourth-century Gothic is extant as a written Germanic language prior to the ninth century...\"}} Starting with [[Julius Caesar]] (100-44 BCE), several Roman authors placed their homeland, ''[[Germania]]'', roughly between the [[Lower Rhine]] and the [[Vistula]], and distinguished them from other broad categories of peoples better known to Rome, especially the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gauls]] to their southwest, and \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" [[Sarmatians]] to their southeast.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=5-6}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Greek writers, in contrast, consistently categorized the Germanic peoples from east of the Rhine as a type of Gaul.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=51}}\n\nWith the possible exception of some tribes near the Rhine, there is no evidence that the Germanic peoples called themselves or their lands \"Germanic\" (see [[:#Definitions of Germanic peoples#Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"|below]]).<ref>{{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Latin and Greek writers report centuries of historical interactions with Germanic peoples on the Rhine and Danube, but from about 400, several long-established Germanic peoples on the [[Middle Danube]] were replaced by newcomers from the north or east. The description of peoples as \"Germanic\" in [[late antiquity]] was mainly restricted to the Rhine region, and thus especially referred to the [[Franks]], and sometimes also the [[Alamanni]].\n\nBroader modern definitions of the Germanic peoples include peoples who were not known as ''Germani'' or Germanic peoples in their own time, but who are treated as one group of cultures, mostly because of their use of Germanic languages.{{efn|This approach is sometimes questioned. {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"Concurrent with the creation of these linguistic theories, historians and politicians integrated them into their justifications and explanations of the rise of the nation-state, which is now again in question.\" {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014|p=520}}, using the [[Goths|Gothic peoples]] as an example: \"Linguistically, we can justify a grouping on the basis that all these peoples spoke a related form of Indo-European language, whether East, West or North Germanic. Such a modern definition, however, does not equate with the classical idea of the Germani.\" {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=222}}: \"No discernible benefit comes from out being reminded again and again in modern writings that many of these barbarians at each other's throats probably spoke dialects of the same language. The G-word can be dispensed with.\"}} Thus, in modern writing, \"Germanic peoples\" is a term which commonly includes peoples who were not referred to as Germanic by contemporaries, and spoke distinct languages, only categorized as Germanic in modern times. Examples include the late Roman [[Goths]], and the medieval [[Norse language|Norse]]-speaking Vikings.\n\nThe languages of the earliest known Germanic peoples of [[classical antiquity]] have left only fragmentary evidence. The first long texts which have survived were written outside ''Germania'' in the [[Gothic language]] from the region that is today [[Ukraine]] and in [[Old English]] from the British Isles.{{sfn|Todd|2004|p=11}} Languages in this family are widespread today in Europe, and have dispersed worldwide, the family being represented by major modern languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] and [[German language|German]]. The [[Eastern Germanic]] branch of the Germanic language family, once found in what is now Poland and the Ukraine, is extinct.\n\nApart from language and geography, proposed connections between the diverse Germanic peoples described by classical and medieval sources, archaeology, and linguistics are the subject of ongoing debate among scholars:\n*On the one hand there is doubt about whether late Roman-era Germanic peoples should be treated as unified by any single unique shared [[culture]], [[collective consciousness]], or even language.<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}}; {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|pp=47,50-51}}.</ref> For example, the tendency of some historians to describe late Roman historical events in terms of Germanic language speakers has been criticized by other scholars because it implies a single coordinated group. [[Walter Goffart]] has gone so far as to suggest that historians should avoid the term when discussing that period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc=Preface}}: \"Strange as it may seem to hear it said, there were no Germanic peoples in late antiquity. The illusion that there were can be outgrown.\"</ref>\n*On the other hand, there is a connected debate concerning the extent to which any significant Germanic traditions apart from language, even smaller scale tribal traditions, survived ''after'' Roman times, when new political entities formed in Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some of these new entities are seen as precursors of European [[nation states]] that have survived into modern times, such as [[English people|England]] and [[French people|France]], and so such proposed connections back to medieval and classical barbarian nations were important to many of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[nationalist]] movements, which developed across Europe in modern times{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=13}} (The most notable of these has been \"[[Germanicism]]\", which saw [[Germans]] especially as direct heirs of a single Europe-conquering Germanic race and culture - a popular narrative which helped inspire [[Nazism]].<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}.</ref>) In contrast, more complex proposals about continuity today, such as those proposed by [[:de:Reinhard Wenskus|Reinhard Wenskus]], tend to focus on the possibility of more limited \"kernels\" of cultural traditions, which can be carried by relatively small groups with, or without, large-scale migrations.<ref>Examples: {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=13-14,19-20}}; {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=50-51}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, genetic studies have begun to look more systematically at questions of ancestry, using both modern and ancient DNA. However, the connection between modern Germanic languages, ethnicity and genetic heritage is thought by many scholars to be unlikely to ever be simple or uncontroversial. [[Guy Halsall]] for example writes: \"The danger, barely addressed (at best dismissed as a purely \u2018ideological\u2019 objection), is of reducing ethnicity to biology and thus to something close to the nineteenth-century idea of race, at the basis of the \u2018nation state\u2019.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=518}}\n{{TOC limit|5}}\n\n==Definitions of Germanic peoples==\n{{Split section portions|date=March 2020|discuss=Talk:Germanic peoples#An article to define the scope of another article?}}\n===General===\nPossibly based on discussions with Gaulish allies during [[Gallic Wars|his campaign]] there, Julius Caesar published the first basic definition of what makes any people or peoples \"Germanic\", rather than for example Gaulish.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=52-53}} This definition involved several criteria, allowing the possibility of debatable cases.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=100}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=8-10}}.</ref> Definitions of Germanic peoples continue to involve discussion of similar criteria:\n\n*Geography. The Germanic peoples are seen as peoples who originated, before Caesar's time, from somewhere between the Lower Rhine and Lower Vistula, so-called ''\"[[Germania]]\"''. Already for Caesar, use of this definition requires knowing which people moved away from this homeland.\n*Language. Tacitus already referred to Suebian languages as a way of determining if a people was Germanic. Scholars defined a family of Germanic languages, which at least some of the ''Germani'' spoke, for example the Suevi. \n*[[Culture]], in the sense of clothing, economy, cults, laws and lifestyle of the different Germanic peoples was already used by Tacitus and Caesar to help distinguish the ''Germani'' from other northern peoples. In modern times, archaeologists study the surviving physical evidence left by the peoples of ''Germania'', and they have defined various regional cultures. Of these, there is consensus that at least the [[Jastorf culture]], between the Elbe and [[Oder]] rivers, was Germanic-speaking already in the time of Caesar. In parallel, other scholars have looked for textual fragmentary evidence concerning the laws, legends and cults of these peoples, and scholars such as [[Dennis Howard Green]] have sought leads in the Germanic languages themselves.{{sfn|Green|2007}}\n\nIn modern times, attempts to define characteristics which unite all or some of these peoples more objectively, using linguistic or archaeological criteria, have thus led to the possibility of the term \"Germanic\" being used to apply to more peoples, in other periods and regions.

This \"''Germania magna''\", or Greater ''Germania'', was seen as a large wild country roughly east of the [[Rhine]], and north of the [[Danube]], but not everyone from within the area bounded by those rivers was ever described by Roman authors as Germanic, and not all ''Germani'' lived there.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2002|p=59-60}} The opening of Tacitus's ''Germania'' gave a rough definition only:\n<blockquote>Germania is separated from the Gauls, the [[Rhaetians]], and [[List_of_ancient_tribes_in_Illyria#Pannonian_tribes|Pannonii]], by the rivers Rhine and Danube.

In contrast, in the south of Greater ''Germania'' nearer the Danube, the Germanic peoples were seen by these Roman writers as immigrants or conquerors, living with other peoples whom they had come to dominate. More specifically, Tacitus noted various [[Suebi]]an Germanic-speaking peoples from the [[Elbe|Elbe river]] in the north, such as the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], pushing into the [[Hercynian forest]] regions towards the Danube, where the Gaulish [[Volcae]], [[Helvetii]] and [[Boii]] had lived.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'' 6.24; Tacitus, ''Germania''\n[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:28 28]; {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|loc=p.6,p.53}}.</ref>\n\nRoman writers who added to Caesar's theoretical description, especially Tacitus, also at least partly defined the ''Germani'' by non-geographic criteria such as their economy, religion, clothing, and language.

Even the language from which it derives is a subject of dispute.{{efn|See for example {{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}} and {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=80}}. The latter gives a detailed summary of some of the many proposals. {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=5}}, for example, thinks \"Germani\" must be Gaulish. Historian Wolfgang Pfeifer more or less concurs with Wolfram and surmises that the name Germani is likely of Celtic etymology, related in this case to the Old Irish word ''gair'' (neighbors) or could be tied to the Celtic word for their war cries ''gairm'', which simplifies into \"the neighbors\" or \"the screamers\".{{sfn|Pfeifer|2000|p=434}} But there is no consensus.}}\nWhatever it meant, the name probably applied originally only to a smaller group of people, the so-called \"''[[Germani cisrhenani]]''\", whose Latin scholarly name simply indicates that these were ''Germani'' living on the western side of the Rhine (see below).<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=4-5}}; {{harvtxt|Petrikovits|1999}}</ref> Tacitus reported that these Germanic peoples in Gaul, ancestors of the [[Tungri]] in his time, were the first people to be called ''Germani''.<ref name=tac2>Tacitus ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:2 2]).</ref> According to Tacitus, their name had transferred to peoples such as those within the alliance of [[Ariovistus]], as a name having connotations that frightened potential enemies. While Caesar and Tacitus saw this Rhineland people as Germanic in the broader sense also, they do not fit easily with the much broader definitions of \"Germanic\" used by them or modern scholars. These original ''Germani'' are therefore a significant complication for all attempts to define the Germanic peoples according to which side of the Rhine they lived on, or according to their probable language.\n\n[[File:Two types of Germani.png|thumb|300px|The two main types of \"Germani\" in the time of Julius Caesar. (Approximate positions only.) Later Roman imperial provinces shown with red shading. On the Rhine are ''Germania Inferior'' (north) and ''Germania Superior'' (south).]]\nCaesar described how the country of these ''Germani cisrhenani'' stretched well west of the Lower Rhine, into modern [[Belgium]], and it had done so long before the Romans came into close contact. Neither Caesar nor Tacitus saw this as clashing with their broader definitions, because they believed these ''Germani'' had moved from east of the Rhine, where the other ''Germani'' lived. But this was not recent: Caesar reported that they were already on the west side during the [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101 BCE), generations earlier.<ref>Caesar, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:2.4 2.4].</ref> The early ''Germani'' on both sides of the Lower Rhine were however distinguished from the Suebian ''Germani'' by Caesar, Tacitus, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo. Strabo even said that the ''Germani'' near the Rhine not only differed little from the Celts, but also that the Latin-speakers called them \"Germani\" because they were the \"genuine\" Gauls (which is a possible meaning of ''Germani'' in Latin).<ref name=strabo>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.2 7.1.2].</ref> Pliny the Elder and Tacitus reported a tradition that the Lower Rhine ''Germani'' could be distinguished from the \"[[Ingaevones]]\" (who lived on the North Sea coast) as \"the [[Istaevones]]\", and the \"[[Herminones]]\" (who included the Suebian peoples) living inland of these groups (see below). Modern historical linguists and archaeologists have also come to doubt that these western ''Germani'' spoke a Germanic language as defined today, or shared the same [[material culture]], at least at the time of their first contact with Caesar and the Romans.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Roymans|2014|p=29}}: \"The archaeology of the Late Iron Age argues for a north-south articulation of the northwest European continent, in which the Rhine does not function as a cultural boundary.

It is believed by many scholars that the inscription should originally have referred to these Gaesatae.{{sfn|Polverini|1994|page=2}}\n*A third author sometimes thought to have written about the Germani is [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille]], who wrote about northern Europe, but his works have not survived. Later reports of his writings show that he wrote about the areas and tribes later called Germanic but do not necessarily show that he called them Germanic.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}} (For example, Pliny the Elder says he described the Baltic Sea and mentioned a large country of \"Guiones\", often interpreted as the [[Gutones]], described by Tacitus. Their land included an estuary that is one day's sail from an island where [[amber]] was collected, which in turn neighbours the [[Teutones]], but an alternative interpretation is that these were (In)guiones (see below) on the North Sea coast.<ref>Pliny the elder, ''Natural History'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.27 4.27(/\"13\")] and [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:37.11 37.11(/\"7\")]. See {{harvtxt|Timpe|1989|p=330}}.</ref>)\n\nAfter Caesar, Roman authors such as Tacitus followed his example in using the Germanic terminology to refer retroactively to peoples known to the Romans or Greeks before Caesar. As noted above, the Cimbri had previously been described as Celtic or [[Cimmerian]], and Greek writers continued to do so, while  Caesar described them as Germanic. Tacitus and Strabo both proposed with some uncertainty that the [[Bastarnae]], a large people known to the Graeco-Roman world before Caesar, from the region of what is now [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Ukrainian Galicia]] and [[Moldavia|Moldava]], might also have had mixed Germanic ancestry, and according to Tacitus, even a Germanic language. Pliny the Elder categorized them as a separate major division of the ''Germani'' like Istvaeones, Ingvaeones, and Irminones, but also separate from an eastern group which contained the [[Vandals]] and the [[Gutones]], both in what is now Poland.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.3.17 7.3.17]; Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Pliny, ''Natural History'',[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28].</ref> (As already mentioned however, [[Livy]] said they spoke a language like the [[Scordisci]].<ref>Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|History of Rome]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi00140.perseus-eng3:57 40.57].</ref>)\n\n===Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"===\nThe theoretical descriptions of Germanic peoples by Tacitus, which have been very influential in modern times, may never have been commonly read or used in the Roman era.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}} It is clear in any case that in later Roman times the Rhine frontier (or ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), the area where Caesar had first come in contact with Suevians and ''Germani cisrhenani'', was the normal \"Germanic\" area mentioned in writing. [[Walter Goffart]] has written that \"the one incontrovertible Germanic thing\" in the Roman era was \"the two Roman provinces of 'Germania,' on the middle and lower course of the Rhine river\" and: \"Whatever 'Germania' had meant to Tacitus, it had narrowed by the time of [[Jerome|St Jerome]] to an archaic or poetic term for the land normally called [[Austrasia|Francia]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=187}} and {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=112-113}}.</ref> Edward James similarly wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems clear that in the fourth century 'German' was no longer a term which included all western barbarians. [...] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], in the later fourth century, only uses ''Germania'' when he is referring to the Roman provinces of Upper Germany and Lower Germany; east of ''Germania'' are ''Alamannia'' and ''Francia''.{{sfn|James|2009|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\nAs an exceptional case, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], living in what is now southern France, described the [[Burgundians]] of his time as speaking a \"Germanic\" tongue and being \"''Germani''\". Wolfram has proposed that this word was chosen not because of a comparison of languages, but because the Burgundians had come from the Rhine region, and even argued that the use of this word by Sidonius might be seen as evidence against Burgundians being speakers of [[East Germanic]], given that the East Germanic speaking Goths, also present in southern France at this time, were never described this way.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=259}} cites his letter 5, to his friend Syagrius. In contrast, the use of this word by Sidonius is apparently seen differently for example by {{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=157}}, citing Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Carm.'' 12.4.}}\n\nFar from the Rhine, the Gothic peoples in what is today Ukraine, and the Anglo-Saxons in the British Isles, were only called Germanic in one surviving classical text, by [[Zosimus]] (5th century), but only in a case where he mistakenly believed he was writing about Rhineland peoples.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=172}} Otherwise, Goths and similar peoples such as the Gepids, were consistently described as Scythian.\n\n===Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept===\nIn the Greek-speaking eastern Roman empire which continued to exist in the Middle ages, the Germanic concept was also lost or distorted. As explained by Walter Pohl, the late Roman equation of the Franks to the Germani led there to such non-classical contrasts as the French (West Franks) being ''Germani'' and the Germans (East Franks) being ''Alamanni'', or the [[Italo-Normans|Normans in Sicily]] being Franks, but the French being \"Franks and also ''Germani''\". In the [[Strategikon of Maurice|''Strategikon'' of Maurice]], written about 600, a contrast is made between three types of barbarian: Scythians, [[Slavs]], and \"blonde-haired\" peoples such as the Franks and Langobards - apparently having no convenient name to cover them together.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|pp=171-172}}\n\nMedieval writers in western Europe used Caesar's old geographical concept of ''Germania'', which, like the new Frankish and clerical jurisdictions of their time, used the Rhine as a frontier marker, although they did not commonly refer to any contemporary ''Germani''. For example, [[Louis the German]] (''{{lang|la|Ludovicus Germanicus}}'') was named this way because he ruled east of the Rhine, and in contrast the kingdom west of the Rhine was still called ''Gallia'' (Gaul) in scholarly Latin.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=11}}\n\nWriters using Latin in [[West Germanic]]-speaking areas did recognize that those languages were related (Dutch, English, [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], and German). To describe this they referred to \"Teutonic\" words and languages, seeing this as a Latin translation of ''[[Theodiscus]]'', which was a concept that West Germanic speakers used to refer to themselves. It is the source of the modern words \"[[wikt:Dutch|Dutch]]\", German \"[[wikt:Deutsch|Deutsch]]\", and Italian \"[[wikt:Tedesco|Tedesco]]\". [[Romance language]] speakers and others such as the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] were contrasted using words based on another old word, ''[[Walhaz]]'', the source of \"Welsh\", [[Wallach]], [[Welsch]], [[wikt:Walloon|Walloon]], etc., itself coming from the name of the [[Volcae]], a Celtic tribe.<ref name=\"Ringe 2009\">Ringe, Don. \"[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1012 Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence].\" ''Language Log,'' January 2009.</ref> Only a small number of writers were influenced by Tacitus, whose work was known at [[Fulda Abbey]], and few used terminology such as ''lingua Germanica'' instead of ''theudiscus sermo''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc= p.278 & 282}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there were several more origin myths written after Jordanes (see above) which similarly connected some of the post Roman peoples to a common origin in Scandinavia. As pointed out by Walter Pohl, Paul the Deacon even implied that the Goths, like the Lombards, ''descended from'' \"Germanic peoples\", though it is unclear if they continued to be \"Germanic\" after leaving the north.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} [[Freculf|Frechulf of Lisieux]], noted that some believed that the Goths might belong to the \"''nationes Theotistae''\", like the Franks, and that both the Franks and the Goths might have come from Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=46}} It is in this period, the 9th century [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], that scholars are also first recorded speculating about relationships between Gothic and West Germanic languages. [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]] believed the Goths spoke a ''teodisca lingua'' like the Franks, and [[Walafrid Strabo]], calling it a ''theotiscus sermo'', was even aware of their Bible translation. However, though the similarities were noticed, Gothic would not have been intelligible to a West Germanic speaker.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=409-413}}\n\nThe first detailed origins legend of the Anglo-Saxons was by [[Bede]] (died 735), and in his case he named the Angles and Saxons of Britain as tribes who once lived in ''Germania'', like, he says, the [[Frisians]], [[Rugians]], [[Danes]], [[Huns]], Old [[Saxons]] (''Antiqui Saxones'') and the [[Bructeri]]. He even says that British people still call them, corruptly, ''\"Garmani\"''. As with Jordanes and the Gutones, there is other evidence, linguistic and archaeological, which is consistent with his scholarly account, although this does not prove that Bede's non-scholarly contemporaries had accurate knowledge of historical details.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|p=198}}; Bede, ''History'', [https://archive.org/details/venerablebedesec00bede/page/246/mode/2up 5.9].</ref>\n\nIn western Europe then, there was a small scholarly awareness of the Tacitean \"Germanic peoples\", and even their potential connection to the Goths, but much more common were adherence to Caesar's concept of the geographical meaning of ''Germania'' east of the Rhine, and a perception of similarities between some Germanic languages - though they were not given this name until much later.\n\n\n==Later debates==\n===The influence of Jordanes and the ''Origo Gentes'' genre===\nThe ethnic military kingdoms which formed in the western Roman empire (see [[Germanic peoples#5th century. The western empire divided into kingdoms|below]]) each developed their own legends about their ethnic origins, the so-called ''[[Origo gentis]]'' stories. These often included an ancient connection to Romans or [[Troy|Trojans]], as apparently in the stories of the Franks, Burgundians and English, and they also typically mentioned the wild east of \"Scythia\". However, [[Jordanes]] (6th century), who wrote the most detailed surviving Gothic origins story, did effectively propose a connection to northern regions which much earlier authors had described as the remotest parts of ''Germania'', and established a tradition of connecting the earliest origins of Goths and other peoples to [[Scandza|Scandinavia]], which was for him a distant and almost unknown island. He thus connected the Goths (''Gothi'') not only with ancient Amazons, Trojans, Huns, and the similarly-named [[Getae]], but also to the Baltic sea. Some modern writers, such as Wolfram and Heather, still see this as confirmed by the mention of similar sounding \"Gutones\" near the south Baltic coast in earlier authors such as Tacitus and Ptolemy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=115}} Others have noted that Jordanes himself believed the Goths would have left the region centuries before those writers, making the identification doubtful. Indeed, he or his sources must have derived the many of the names of ancient peoples and places from reading old Latin and Greek authors.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nVery influentially, Jordanes called Scandinavia a \"womb of nations\" (''vagina nationum''), asserting that many peoples came from there in prehistoric times. This idea influenced later origin legends including the Lombard origin story, written by [[Paul the Deacon]] (8th century) who opens his work with an explanation of this theory. During the Carolingian renaissance he and other scholars even sometimes used the Germanic terminology.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} (See [[Germanic peoples#Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept|below]].) The Scandinavian theme continued to be influential in medieval times and has even been influential in early modern speculations about Germanic peoples, for example in proposals about not only Goths and Gepids, but also [[Rugii|Rugian]] and Burgundian origins.\n\nThe continuing use of Jordanes and similar writers to attempt to prove that the Goths were \"Germanic\" in more than language continues to arouse debate among scholars, because while his work is unreliable, the Baltic connection on its own is consistent with linguistic and archaeological evidence.<ref>Concerning the archaeological evidence, for the Gothic peoples see {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=120}}.</ref> However, Walter Goffart in particular has criticized the methodology of many modern scholars for using Jordanes and other origins stories as independent sources of real tribal memories, but only when it matches their beliefs arrived at in other ways.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|page=46-47}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Modern \"Germanic\" debates and \"Germanism\"===\n{{See|Pan-Germanism|Viking revival|Gothicism|}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 118-30, Hermanns-Denkmal, Jungdeutsche Tagung.jpg|thumbnail|300px|An event of the [[Young German Order]] at the \"[[Hermannsdenkmal]]\" monument to [[Arminius]], in 1925.

By the late 15th century, [[Tacitus]] had become a focus of interest all around Europe, and, among other effects, this revolutionized ideas in Germany concerning the history of Germany itself. Tacitus continues to be an important influence in Germanic studies of antiquity, and is often read together with the ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]]', who wrote much later.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=43, pp.48ff}}\n<blockquote>Tacitus's ethnography won the attention it had formerly been denied because there now was a Germany, the \"German nation\" that had come into existence since the Carolingians, which Tacitus could now equip with a heaven-sent ancient dignity and pedigree.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nIn this context, in the 19th century, the famous [[folklorist]] and linguist [[Jacob Grimm]] helped popularize the concept of Germanic languages as well as of [[Indo-european languages]]. Apart from the well-known [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], collected with [[Wilhelm Grimm|his brother Wilhelm]], he published, for example, ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' attempting to reconstruct [[Germanic mythology]], and a German dictionary ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' with detailed etymological proposals attempting to reconstruct the oldest Germanic language. He also popularized a new idea of these Germanic speakers, especially those in Germany, clinging valiantly to their supposed Germanic civilization over the centuries.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=48}} says: \"A whole library of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarship can be evoked to show that a \"Germanic antiquity\" existed in parallel to its Greco-Roman counterpart.\"}}\n\nThe subsequently popular modern assertion of strong cultural continuity between Roman-era ''Germani'' and medieval or modern Germanic speakers, especially Germans, assumed a strong connection between a family trees of language categories, and both cultural and racial heritages. The name of the newly defined language family, ''Germanic'', was long unpopular in other countries such as England, where the medieval \"Teutonic\" was seen as less potentially misleading.{{sfn|Chadwick|1945|p=143}} Similarly, in Denmark \"Gothic\" was sometimes used as a term for the language group uniting the ''Germani'' and the Goths, and a modified Gothonic was proposed by [[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]] and used locally.{{sfn|Nielsen|2004}}\n\nThis [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[nationalist]] approach has been rejected in its simplest forms since approximately [[World War II]]. For example, the once common habit of referring to Roman-era Germanic peoples as \"[[Germans]]\" is discouraged by modern historians, and modern [[Germans]] are no longer seen as the main successors of the ''Germani''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|loc=Introduction}} Not only are ideas associated with [[Nazism]] now criticized, but also other romanticized ideas about the Germanic peoples. For example, Guy Halsall has mentioned the popularity of the \"view of the peoples of Germania as, essentially, proto-democratic communes of freemen\".{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=516}} And [[Peter Heather]] has pointed out also that the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory \"that some of Europe's barbarians were ultimately responsible for moving Europe onwards to the [[feudalism|feudal]] modern of production has also lost much of its force\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=614}}\n\nFurther, some historians now question whether there was any unifying Germanic culture even in Roman times, and secondly whether there was any significant continuity at all apart from language, connecting the Roman era Germanic peoples with the mixed new ethnic groups who formed in [[late antiquity]]. Skeptics of such connections include [[Walter Goffart]], and others associated with him and [[Toronto University]].{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=18}} Goffart lists four \"contentions\" about how the Germanic terminology biases the conclusions of historians, and is therefore misleading:{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=7}}\n:1. Barbarian invasions should not be seen as a single collective movement. Different barbarian groups moved for their own reasons under their own leaders.\n:2. The pressures on the late Empire did not have a united source, and often came from within.\n:3. The classical Germanic peoples lacked any unity or center, and so they should not be seen as a civilization in the way Rome is.\n:4. We should not, according to Goffart, accept Jordanes as preserving an authentic oral tradition about a migration from Scandinavia.\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility of a small but significant \"core of tradition\" (''[[wikt:de:Traditionskern|Traditionskern]]'') surviving with the ruling classes of Roman Germanic peoples, in the societies of new medieval Germanic speaking peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Goths]], continues to be defended by other historians. This ''Traditionskern'' concept is associated for example with the [[Vienna School of History]], initiated by [[Reinhard Wenskus]], and later represented by scholars such as [[Herwig Wolfram]] and [[Walter Pohl]].\n\nPeter Heather for example, continues to use the Germanic terminology but writes that concerning proposals of Germanic continuity, \"all subsequent discussion has accepted and started from Wenskus's basic observations\" and \"the ''Germani'' in the first millenium were thus not closed groups with continuous histories\".{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=19}} Heather however believes that such caution now often goes too far in denying any large scale movements of people in specific cases, exemplified by [[Patrick Amory]]'s explanation of the [[Ostrogoths]] and their [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom]] of Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2007}}\n\nAnother proponent of relatively significant continuity, [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]], has argued that the shared use of Germanic languages by, for example, Anglo-Saxons and Goths, implies that they must have had more links to ''Germania'' than only language. While little concrete evidence has survived, Liebeschuetz proposes that the existence of [[Weregild]] laws, stipulating compensation payments to avoid blood feuds, must be Germanic because such laws were not Roman.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|pp=94-96}} Liebeschuetz also argues that recent sceptical scholars \"deprive the ancient Germans and their constituent tribes of any continuous identity\" and this is \"important\" because it makes European history a product of Roman history, not \"a joint creation of Roman and Germans\".{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=90}}[[File:Nordic Bronze Age.png|thumb|upright=1|Map of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, around 1200 BCE]]\n\n==Prehistoric evidence==\n{{Further|Pre-Roman Iron Age}}\n[[File:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The Dejbjerg wagon, National Museum of Denmark]]\n\nCaesar, the original of the idea of the Germanic peoples, believed that in prehistory, before his time, the Rhine had divided these ''Germani'' from the Gauls. However, he noted that there must have already been significant movements in both directions, over the Rhine. Not only did he believe that the ''Germani'' have a long-standing tendency to make raids and group movements from the northeast, involving Germanic peoples such as the Cimbri long before him, and the Suevians in his time, it was also his understanding that there had been a time when the movement went in the opposite direction:\n<blockquote>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans [''Germani''] in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine . Accordingly, the [[Volcae]] [[Tectosages]], seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known by report to [[Eratosthenes]] and some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.24 6.24]</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern archaeologists disagree with this assessment and see no sign of such movements, seeing the Gaulish [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] as native to what is now southern Germany, and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures on both sides of the Lower Rhine in this period quite distinct from the Elbe Germanic peoples. On the other hand, the account of Caesar finds broad agreement with the archaeological record of the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture first expanding to the north, influencing all cultures there, and then suddenly becoming scarce in the north. Subsequently the Jastorf culture expanded in all directions from the region between the lower Elbe and Oder rivers.\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic language|List of Germanic languages}}\nIt is believed that most of the early Germanic peoples spoke [[Germanic languages]].{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2006|p=49|}} \"Germanic-speaking groups dominated most of central and northern Europe beyond Rome's riverine frontiers.

These La T\u00e8ne peoples, who included the ''Germani cisrhenani'', are generally considered unlikely to have spoken Germanic languages as defined today, though some may have spoken unknown related languages or Celtic dialects. To the north of these zones however, in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the archaeological cultures started to become more distinct from La T\u00e8ne culture during the Iron Age.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martens|2014}}</ref>\n\nConcerning Germanic speakers within these northern regions, the relatively well-defined [[Jastorf culture]] matches with the areas described by Tacitus, Pliny the elder and Strabo as Suevian homelands near the lower River Elbe, and stretching east on the Baltic coast to the [[Oder river]]. The Suevian peoples are seen by scholars as early [[West Germanic]] speakers. There is no consensus about whether neighbouring cultures in Scandinavia, Poland, and northwestern Germany were also part of a Germanic (or proto-Germanic)-speaking community at first, but this group of cultures were related to each other, and in contact. To the west of the Elbe for example, on what is now the German North Sea coast, was the so-called [[:de:Harpstedt-Nienburger Gruppe|Harpstedt-Nienburger Group]] between the Jastorf culture and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures of the Lower Rhine. To the east in what is now Poland was the [[Oksywie culture]], in the area where the later [[Wielbark culture]] developed, probably with the entry of [[East Germanic]] speakers. Related also to these and the Jastorf culture, was the [[Przeworsk culture]], which began as another La T\u00e8ne influenced local culture, and apparently became at least partly Germanic-speaking.\n\nThe Jastorf culture came into most direct contact with La T\u00e8ne cultures on the upper Elbe and Oder rivers, believed to correspond to the Celtic-speaking groups such as the Boii and Volcae described in this area by Roman sources. In the south of their range, the Jastorf and Przeworsk material cultures spread together, in the same direction.\n\n==Classical subdivisions==\n{{Further|Ing\u00e6vones|Herminones|Ist\u00e6vones}}\nBy the 1st century CE, the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] reported a division of Germanic peoples into large groupings. Tacitus, in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', specifically stated that one such division mentioned \"in old songs\" (''carminibus antiquis'') derived three such groups from three brothers, sons of [[Mannus]], who was son of an earth-born god, [[Tuisco|Tuisto]]. These terms are also sometimes used in older modern linguistic terminology, attempting to describe the divisions of later Germanic languages:\n*[[Ingvaeones]], nearest to the Ocean.\n*[[Herminones]] in the interior.\n*[[Istvaeones]], the remainder.<ref name=tac2/>\n\nOn the other hand, he wrote in the same passage that some believe that there are other groups which are just as old as these three, including \"the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suevi, Vandilii\". Of these, Tacitus only discussed the Suebi in detail, specifying that they were a very large grouping, with many tribes, with their own names. The largest, he said, was the [[Semnones]] near the Elbe, who \"claim that they are the oldest and the noblest of the Suebi.\"<ref name=tac2/>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], somewhat similarly, named five races of Germani in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', with the same basic three groups as Tacitus, plus two more eastern blocks of Germans, the [[Vandals]], and further east the [[Bastarnae]]. He clarifies that the Istvaeones are near the Rhine, although he only gives one problematic example, the Cimbri. He also clarifies that the Suevi, though numerous, are actually in one of the three Mannus groups. His list:<ref> Plin. Nat. [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28]</ref>\n*The [[Vandals|Vandili]], include the [[Burgundiones]], the [[Varini]], the [[Carini (Germanic tribe)|Carini]], and the [[Gutones]]. The Varini are listed by Tacitus as being Suebic, and the Gutones are described by him as Germanic, leaving open the question of whether they are Suebian.\n*The Ing\u00e6vones include the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the [[Chauci]].\n*The Ist\u00e6vones, who \"join up to the Rhine\", and including the Cimbri [sic, repeated, probably by error]\n*The Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the [[Hermunduri]], the [[Chatti]], the [[Cherusci]],\n*The Peucini, who are also the [[Bastarnae|Bastern\u00e6]], adjoining the [[Dacians|Daci]].\n\nThese accounts and others from the period emphasize that the Suebi formed an especially large and powerful group. Tacitus speaks also of a geographical \"Suevia\" with two halves either side of the [[Sudetes]].<ref name=tac43/> The larger group that the Suevi were part of according to Pliny, the Hermiones, is mentioned in one other source: [[Pomponius Mela]] in his slightly earlier ''Description of the World,'' places \"the farthest people of [[Germania]], the Hermiones\" somewhere to the east of the Cimbri and the Teutones, apparently on the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]]. He did not mention Suebians.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', trans. F.E. Romer, 3.31\u20133.32</ref>\n\nStrabo, who focused mainly on ''Germani'' between the Elbe and Rhine, and does not mention the sons of Mannus, also set apart the names of ''Germani'' who are ''not'' Suevian, in two other groups, similarly implying three main divisions: \"smaller German tribes, as the Cherusci, Chatti, Gamabrivi, Chattuarii, and next the ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi, Bructeri, Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci, Campsiani\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.3 7.1.3]</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern linguistic reconstructions, the classical ethnographers were not helpful in distinguishing two large groups that spoke types of Germanic very different from the Suebians and their neighbours, whose languages are the source of modern [[West Germanic]].\n*The Germanic peoples of the far north, in Scandinavia, were treated as Suebians by Tacitus, though their Germanic dialects would evolve into [[Proto Norse]], and later [[Old Norse]], as spoken by the [[Vikings]], and then the North Germanic language family of today.\n*The \"Gothic peoples\" who later formed large nations in the area that is today Ukraine, were not known to Tacitus, Pliny or Strabo, but their [[East Germanic]] languages are presumed to derive from languages spoken by Pliny's Vandal group (corresponding in part to the group made up of Gothones, Lemovii and Rugii described by Tacitus, who lived near the Baltic sea), and possibly also the Bastarnae.\nThe \"Gothic peoples\" in the territory of present-day Ukraine and Romania were seen by Graeco-Roman writers as culturally \"Scythian\", and not Germanic, and indeed some of them such as the Alans were clearly not Germanic-speaking either. Whether the Gothic-speaking groups among them had any consciousness of their connections to other Germanic-speaking peoples is a subject of dispute between scholars.\n\n==History==\n=== Earliest attestations ===\n\n==== Possible earliest contacts with the classical world (4th\u20133rd centuries BCE) ====\n{{Further|Pytheas|Bastarnae|Scirii}}\nBefore Julius Caesar, Romans and Greeks had very little contact with northern Europe itself.

As mentioned above, Caesar had this written up in a way which introduced the term \"Germanic\" to refer to peoples such as the Cimbri and Suebi.\n*63 BCE Ariovistus, described by Caesar as Germanic, led mixed forces over the Rhine into Gaul as an ally of the [[Sequani]] and [[Averni]] in their battle against the [[Aedui]], who they defeated at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]]. He stayed there on the west of the Rhine. He was also accepted as an ally by the Roman senate.\n*58 BCE. Caesar, as governor of Gaul, took the side of the [[Aedui]] against Ariovistus and his allies. He reported that Ariovistus had already settled 120,000 of his people, was demanding land for 24,000 [[Harudes]] who subsequently defeated the Aedui, and had 100 clans of Suebi coming into Gaul. Caesar defeated Ariovistus at the [[Battle of Vosges (58 BC)]].\n::Caesar listed people who fought for Ariovistus as the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Tribocci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]], [[Sedusii]], and \"Suevi\".<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.51 1.51]</ref>\n*55-53 BCE. Controversially, Caesar moved his attention to Northern Gaul. In 55 BCE he made a show of strength on the Lower Rhine, crossing it with a quickly made bridge, and then massacring a large migrating group of [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] who crossed the Rhine from the east. In the winter of 54/53 the [[Eburones]], the largest group of ''[[Germani cisrhenani]]'', revolted against the Romans and then dispersed into forests and swamps.\n::Caesar listed some ''Germani cisrhenani'' peoples: Eburones, [[Condrusi]], [[Caeraesi]], [[Paemani]] and [[Segni]]. He believed they were related to tribes on the east bank such as [[Sigambri]] and [[Ubii]]. He believed the Suevi were pressing such tribes over the Rhine from further east.\nStill in the 1st century BCE the term ''Germani'' was already used by Strabo (see above) and [[Cicero]] in ways clearly influenced by Caesar.<ref>Cicero, ''Against Piso'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi027.perseus-lat1:33 33].</ref> Of the tribes encountered by Caesar, the Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes and Ubii were all found later, on the east of the Rhine, along the new frontier of the Roman empire.\n\n====Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BCE\u201468 CE) and the Year of Four Emperors (69 CE)====\n{{Further|Roman Iron Age|Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|Year of the Four Emperors}}\n[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Roman sculpture of a young man sometimes identified as [[Arminius]]]]\nDuring the reign of [[Augustus]] from 27 BCE until 14 CE, the Roman empire became established in Gaul, with the Rhine as a border. This empire made costly campaigns to pacify and control the large region between the Rhine and Elbe. In the reign of his successor [[Tiberius]] it became a policy to leave the border at the Rhine, and expand the empire no further in that direction. The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], the extended family of Augustus, played close personal attention to management of this Germanic frontier, establishing a tradition followed by many future emperors. Major campaigns were led from the Rhine personally by [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], step-son of Augustus, then by his brother the future emperor Tiberius; next by the son of Drusus, [[Germanicus]] (father of the future emperor [[Caligula]] and grandfather of [[Nero]]).\n\nIn 38 BCE, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], consul of Transalpine Gaul, became the second Roman to lead forces over the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#49 48.49].</ref> In 31 BCE [[Gaius Carrinas (consul 43 BC)|Gaius Carrinas]] repulsed an attack by Suebi from east of the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#21 51.21].</ref> In 25 BCE [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinicius]] took vengeance on some ''Germani'' in ''Germania'', who had killed Roman traders.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#26 53.26].</ref> In 17/16 BCE at the [[Battle of Bibracte]] the [[Sugambri]], [[Usipetes]], and [[Tencteri]] crossed the Rhine and defeated the 5th legion under [[Marcus Lollius]], capturing the legion's eagle.\n\nFrom 13 BCE until 17 CE there were major Roman campaigns across the Rhine nearly every year, often led by the family of Augustus. First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and [[Frisians]] near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the [[Chauci]], [[Cherusci]], [[Chatti]] and [[Suevi]] (including the [[Marcomanni]]). These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of ''Germania''. However, within this period two Germanic kings formed large anti-Roman alliances. Both of them, ironically, had spent some of their youth in Rome:\n*After 9 BCE, [[Maroboduus]] of the Marcomanni, had led his people away from the Roman activities into the [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] area, defended by forests and mountains, and formed alliances with other peoples. He was referred to as a king of the Suevians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-eng1:2.26 2.26].</ref> In 6 CE Rome planned an attack but forces were needed for the [[Bellum Batonianum|Illyrian revolt]] in the Balkans, until 9 CE, at which time another problem arose in the north...\n*In 9 CE, [[Arminius]] of the Cherusci, initially an ally of Rome, drew the a large unsuspecting Roman force into a trap in northern Germany, and defeated [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Tiberius and Germanicus spent the next few years recovering their dominance of northern Germany. They made Maroboduus an ally, and he did not assist Arminius.\n*17-18 CE, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, with indecisive results.\n*19 CE, Marobduus was deposed by a rival claimant, perhaps supported by the Romans, and fled to Italy. He died in 37 CE. Germanicus also died, in [[Antioch]].\n*21 CE. Arminius died, murdered by opponents within his own tribe.\n\nStrabo, writing in this period in Greek, mentioned that apart from the area near the Rhine itself, the areas to the east were now inhabited by the Suevi, \"who are also named Germans, but are superior both in power and number to the others, whom they drove out, and who have now taken refuge on this side the Rhine\". Various peoples had fallen \"prey to the flames of war\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:4.3.4 4.3.4].</ref>\n\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty also recruited northern Germanic warriors, particularly men of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], as personal bodyguards to the Roman emperor, forming the so-called [[Numerus Batavorum]].

The first of these conglomerations mentioned in the historical sources were the [[Alamanni]] (a term meaning \"all men\") who appear in Roman texts sometime in the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=109}} These are believed to have been a mixture of mainly Suebian peoples, who coalesced in the [[Agri Decumates]].

However, the ability to handle the barbarians in the old way broke down in the late 4th century and the western part of the empire itself broke down. In addition to the Franks on the Rhine frontier, and Suevian peoples such as the Alamanni, the eastern Germanic-speaking \"Gothic peoples\" now played an increasing role both inside and outside imperial territory.\n====Gothic entry into the empire====\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Gothic wars of the late 4th century, were in some ways similar to the biggest border conflicts of the past, but saw the defeat of a major Roman army and killing of emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianopolis]] (378). While the eastern empire eventually recovered, the subsequent long reigning western emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (reigned 393-423) was unable to impose imperial authority over much of the empire, for most of his reign.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=234-237}}</ref> In contrast to the eastern empire, in the west the \"attempts of its ruling class to use the Roman-barbarian kings to preserve the [[res publica]] failed\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=103}}\n\nThe Gothic wars were affected indirectly by the arrival of the nomadic [[Huns]] from Central Asia into the Ukrainian region. Some Gothic peoples, such as the [[Gepids]] and the [[Greuthungi]] (sometimes seen as predecessors of the later [[Ostrogoths]]), joined the newly forming Hunnish faction, and played a prominent role in the Hunnic Empire, where Gothic became a [[lingua franca]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=142}} Based on the description of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], Guy Halsall has argued that the Hunnish hegemony developed after a major campaign by Valens against the Goths, which had caused great damage, but failed to achieve a decisive victory.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=173}} Peter Heather has argued that Socrates should be rejected on this point, as inconsistent with the testimony of [[Ammianus]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=160}}\n\nIn contrast, the Gothic [[Thervingi]] had borne the impact of the campaign of Valens, under the leadership of [[Athanaric]], and were losers against the Huns, but clients of Rome. A new faction under leadership of [[Fritigern]], a christian, were given asylum inside the Roman Empire in 376 CE. They crossed the Danube and became ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=594}} With the emperor occupied in the Middle East, the Tervingi were treated badly, becoming desperate, and significant numbers of mounted Greuthungi, [[Alans]] and others were able to cross the river and support a Tervingian uprising leading to the massive Roman defeat at Adrianople.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=176-178}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|pp=79-87}}.</ref>\n\nAround 383, the Romans and the Goths now within the empire came to agreements about the terms under which the Goths should live. There is debate about the exact nature of such agreements, and for example whether it allowed the continuous semi-independent existence of pre-existing peoples, however the Goths do appear to have been allowed more privileges than traditional settlements with such outside groups.<ref>Contrast {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=180-185}} and {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=189-196}}.</ref> One result of the large settlement was that the imperial army now had a large number of Goths, including Gothic generals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=183-185}}; {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=194}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=110}}.</ref>\n\n====Imperial turmoil====\nBy 383 a new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], was seen as victorious over the Goths and having the situation back under control. Goths were a prominent but resented part of the eastern military. The Greutungi and Alans had been settled in [[Pannonia]] by the western co-emperor [[Gratian]] (assassinated in 383) who was himself a Pannonian. Theodosius died 395, and was succeeded by his sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east, and Honorius, who was still a minor, in the west. The Western empire had however become destabilized since 383, with several young emperors including Gratian having previously been murdered. Court factions and military leaders in the east and west attempted to control the situation.\n\n[[Alaric I|Alaric]] was a Roman military commander of Gothic background, who first appears in the record in the time of Theodosius. He became one of the various Roman competitors for influence and power in the difficult situation. The forces he led were described as mixed barbarian forces, and clearly included many other people of Gothic background, which had become common in the eastern empire. In an important turning point for Roman history, during the factional turmoil, his army came to act increasingly as an independent political entity within the Roman empire, and he eventually came to be referred to as their king, probably around 401 CE, when he lost his official Roman title.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=206,217}} This is the origin of the [[Visigoths]], who the empire later allowed to settle in what is now southwestern France. While military units had often had their own ethnic history and symbolism, this is the first time that such a group became a new kingdom. There is disagreement about whether Alaric or his family had a royal background, but there is no doubt that this kingdom was a new entity, very different from any previous Gothic kingdoms.\n\n====Invasions of 401\u2013411====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Rhine|Radagaisus}}\nIn the aftermath of the large scale Gothic entries into the empire, the Germanic Rhine groups, the Franks and Alemanni, became more secure in their positions in 395, when [[Stilicho]] made agreements with them so that he could withdraw the imperial forces from their Rhine frontier in order to use them in his conflicts with Alaric and the Eastern empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=199}}\n\nOn the Danube, change was far more dramatic. In the words of Walter Goffart:\n:Between 401 and 411, four distinct groups of barbarians - different from Alaric's Goths - invaded Roman territory, all apparently on one-way journeys, in large-scale efforts to transpose themselves onto imperial soil and not just plunder and return home.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=94}}\n\nThe reasons that these invasions apparently all dispersed from the same area, the Middle Danube, are uncertain. It is most often argued that the Huns must have already started moving west, and pressuring the Middle Danube. Peter Heather for example writes that around 400, \"a highly explosive situation was building up in the Middle Danube, as Goths, Vandals, Alans and other refugees from the Huns moved west of the Carpathians\" into the area of modern Hungary on the Roman frontier.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=182-183,197}}\n\nWalter Goffart, in contrast, has pointed out that there is no clear evidence of new eastern groups arriving in the area immediately before the great movements, and so it remains possible that the Huns moved West after these large groups had left the Middle Danube. Goffart's suggestion is that the example of the Goths, such as those led by Alaric, had set an example leading to a \"common perception that warriors could improve their condition by forcing their existence on the attention of the Empire\".{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=ch.5}}\n\nWhatever the chain of events, the Middle Danube later became the centre of Attila's loose empire containing many East Germanic people from the east, who remained there after the death of Attila. The make-up of peoples in that area, previously the home of the Germanic Marcomanni, Quadi and non-Germanic Iazyges, changed completely in ways which had a significant impact on the Roman empire and its European neighbours. In the future, though the new peoples ruling this area still included Germanic-speakers, as discussed above, they were not described by Romans as ''Germani'', but rather \"Gothic peoples\".\n\n*In 401, [[Claudian]] mentions a Roman victory over a large force including Vandals, in the province of Ra\u00ebtia. It is possible that this group was involved in the later crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=88-89}}\n*In 405-406, [[Radagaisus]] who was probably Gothic, entered the empire on the Middle Danube with a very large force of unclearly defined, but apparently Gothic, composition, and succeeded to invade Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=182}} He was captured and killed in 406 near Florence and 12000 of his men recruited into Roman forces.\n*A more successful invasion apparently also originating from the Middle Danube, reached the Rhine a few months later. As described by Halsall: \"On 31 December 405 a huge body from the interior of Germania crossed the Rhine: Siling and Hasding Vandals, Sueves and Alans. [...] The Franks in the area fought back furiously and even killed the Vandal king. Significantly no source mentions any defense by Roman troops.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=211}} The composition of this group of barbarians, who were not all Germanic-speaking, indicates that they had traveled from the area north of the [[Middle Danube]]. (The Suebians involved may well have included remnants of the once powerful Marcomanni and Quadi.) The non-Germanic Alans were the largest group, and one part of them under [[King Goar]] settled with Roman agreement in Gaul, while the rest of these peoples entered Roman Iberia in 409 and established kingdoms there, and some traveled further to establish the Vandal kingdom of North Africa.\n*In 411 a Burgundian group established themselves in northern [[Germania Superior]] on the Rhine, between Franks and Alamanni, holding the cities of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. They and a group of Alans helped establish yet another short-lived claimant to the throne, [[Jovinus]], who was eventually defeated by the Visigoths cooperating with Honorius.\n\nMotivated by the ensuing chaos in Gaul, in 406 the Roman army in Britain elected [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine \"III\"]] as emperor and they took control there.\n\nIn 408, the eastern emperor Arcadius died, leaving a child as successor, and the west Roman military leader [[Stilicho]] was killed. Alaric, wanting a formal Roman command but unable to negotiate one, invaded Rome itself, twice, in 401 and 408.\n\n[[Constantius III]], who became ''[[Magister militum]]'' by 411, restored order step-by-step, eventually allowing the Visigoths to settle within the empire in southwest Gaul. He also committed to re-taking control of Iberia, from the Rhine-crossing groups. When Constantius died in 421, having been co-emperor himself for one year, Honorius was the only emperor in the West. However, Honorius died in 423 without heir. After this, the Western Roman empire steadily lost control of its provinces.\n\n==== From Western Roman Empire to medieval kingdoms (420\u2013568) ====\n{{Further|Decline of the Western Roman Empire|Barbarian kingdoms}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Germania|Germanic]] kingdoms and tribes after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE]]\n[[File:Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Coin of [[Odoacer]], Ravenna, 477, with Odoacer in profile, depicted with a \"barbarian\" [[moustache]].]]\n[[File:Germanic kingdoms 526CE.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Germanic kingdoms in 526 CE]]\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|2nd century to 6th century simplified migrations]]\nThe Western Roman Empire declined over several steps in the 5th and 6th centuries, and the eastern emperors only had limited control over events in Italy and the western empire. Germanic speakers who by now dominated the Roman military in Europe, and lived both inside and outside the empire, played many roles in this complex dynamic. Notably, as the old territory of the western empire came to be ruled on a regional basis, the barbarian military forces, ruled now by kings, took over administration with differing levels of success. With some exceptions, such as the [[Alans]] and [[Bretons]], most of these new political entities identified themselves with a Germanic-speaking heritage.\n\nIn the 420s, [[Flavius A\u00ebtius]] was a general who successfully used Hunnish forces on several occasions, fighting Roman factions, and various barbarians including Goths and Franks. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of ''magister militum'' in the western empire, putting him in control of much of its policy. One of his first conflicts was with [[Bonifacius|Boniface]], a rebellious governor of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in modern Tunisia and Libya. Both sides sought an alliance with the Vandals based in southern Spain who had acquired a fleet there. In this context, the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal and Alan kingdom]] of North Africa and the western Mediterranean would come into being.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=240}}\n*In 433 A\u00ebtius was in exile and spent time in the Hunnish domain.\n*In 434, the Vandals were granted the control of some parts of northwest Africa, but A\u00ebtius defeated Boniface using Hunnish forces.\n*In 436 A\u00ebtius defeated the Burgundians on the Rhine with the help of Hunnish forces.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=244}}\n*In 439 the Vandals and their allies captured Carthage. The Romans made a new agreement recognizing the Visigothic kingdom.\n*In 440, the Hunnish \"empire\" as it can now be called, under [[Attila]] and his brother Bleda began a series of attacks over the Danube into the eastern empire, and Danubian part of the western empire. They received enormous payments from the eastern empire and then focused their attentions to the west, where they were already familiar with the situation, and in friendly contact with the African Vandals.\n*In 442 A\u00ebtius seems to have granted the Alans who had remained in Gaul a kingdom, apparently including [[Orl\u00e9ans]], possibly to counter local independent Roman groups (so called [[Bagaudae]], who also competed for power in Iberia).\n*In 443 A\u00ebtius settled the Burgundians from the Rhine deeper in the empire, in Savoy in Gaul.\n*In 451, the large mixed force of Attila crossed the Rhine but was defeated by Aetius with forces from the settled barbarians in Gaul - Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians and Alans.\n*In 452 Attila attacked Italy, but had to retreat to the Middle Danube because of disease.\n*In 453, A\u00ebtius and Attila both died.\n*In 454, the Hunnish alliance divided and fought the [[Battle of Nedao]]. The original names of the peoples in the alliance appear again. Several of them were allowed to become federates of the eastern empire in the Balkans, and others created kingdoms in the Middle Danube.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Franks and Alamanni tended to remain in small kingdoms but these began to extend deeper into the empire. In northern Gaul, a Roman military \"King of Franks\" also seems to have existed, [[Childeric I]], whose successor [[Clovis I]] established dominance of the smaller kingdoms of the Franks and Alamanni, who they defeated at the [[Battle of Tolbiac|Battle of Z\u00fclpich]] in 496. \n\nCompared to Gaul, what happened in [[Roman Britain]], which was similarly both isolated from Italy and heavily Romanized, is less clearly recorded. However the end result was similar, with a Germanic-speaking military class, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], taking over administration of what remained of Roman society, and conflict between an unknown number of regional powers. While major parts of Gaul and Britain redefined themselves ethnically on the basis of their new rulers, as [[West Francia|Francia]] and [[England]], in England the main population also became Germanic speaking. The exact reasons for the difference are uncertain, but significant levels of migration played a role.{{sfn|Halsall|2013}}\n\nIn 476 [[Odoacer]], a Roman soldier who came from the tribes of the Middle Danube in the aftermath of Nedao, became King of Italy, removing the last western emperors from power. He was murdered and replaced in 493 by [[Theoderic the Great]], described as [[King of the Ostrogoths]], one of the most powerful Middle Danube peoples of the old Hun alliance. Theoderic had been raised up and supported by the eastern emperors, and his administration continued a sophisticated Roman administration, in cooperation with the traditional [[Roman senate|Roman senatorial]] class. Similarly, Roman lifestyles continued in North Africa under the Vandals, Savoy under the Burgundians, and within the Visigothic realm.\n\nThe Ostrogothic kingdom ended in 542 when the eastern emperor [[Justinian]] made a last great effort to reconquer the [[Western Mediterranean]]. The conflicts destroyed the Italian senatorial class.{{sfn|Geary|2002|p=113}} The eastern empire was also unable to hold Italy for long, and in 568 the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]], a Suebian people who had entered the Middle Danubian region from the north conquering and partly absorbing the frontier peoples there, entered Italy and created the Italian [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] there. These Lombards now included Suevi, [[Heruli]], [[Gepids]], [[Bavarians]], Bulgars, Avars, Saxons, Goths, and [[Thuringians]]. As Peter Heather has written these \"peoples\" were no longer peoples in any traditional sense.<ref>{{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=240}}, citing [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref>\n\nOlder accounts which describe a long period of massive movements of peoples and military invasions are over-simplified, and only describe specific incidents. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the Germanic peoples did not and could not \"conquer the more advanced Roman world\" nor were they able to \"restore it as a political and economic entity\"; instead, he asserts that the empire's \"universalism\" was replaced by \"tribal particularism\" which gave way to \"regional patriotism\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=308}} The Germanic peoples who overran the Western Roman Empire probably numbered less than 100,000 people per tribe, including approximately 15,000-20,000 warriors. They constituted a tiny minority of the population in the lands over which they seized control.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=7}}: \"[T]hese tribes were surprisingly small: fifteen to twenty thousand warriors\u2014which means a total of about one hundred thousand people in a tribe\u2014was the maximum number a large people could raise... These people are likewise presented as conquerors of the Roman Empire, even though they constituted a vanishing minority within it.\"}}\n\nApart from the common history many of them had in the Roman military, and on Roman frontiers, a new and longer-term unifying factor for the new kingdoms was that by 500, the start of the [[Middle Ages]], most of the old Western empire had converted to the same Rome-based [[Catholicism|Catholic]] form of [[Christianity]]. A key turning point was the conversion of Clovis I in 508. Before this point, many of the Germanic kingdoms, such as the Goths and Burgundians, were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians - a form of Christianity which they perhaps took up in the time of the Arian emperor [[Valens]], but which was now considered a heresy.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Early Middle Ages}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Frankish expansion from the early kingdom of [[Clovis I]] (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870)]]\n[[File:Viking Expansion.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map showing area of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements during the [[Viking Age]], including [[Normans|Norman]] conquests]]\nIn the centuries after 568, the [[Visigothic kingdom]], by now centred in Spain, was ended by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the 8th century. Much of continental catholic Europe became part of a greater [[Francia]] under the [[Merovingian]] and then the [[Carolingian dynasty]], which began with [[Pepin the Short]], the son of [[Charles Martel]]. Charles, though not a king, reconsolidated the Frankish kingdom's dominance over Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians and Burgundians, and defeated the Umayyads at the 732 [[Battle of Tours]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] conquered the Lombards in 774, and in an important turning point in European history, was crowned as emperor by [[Pope Leo III]] in Rome on Christmas Day, 800 CE. This consolidated a shift in the power structure from the south to the north, and was also a strong symbolic link to Rome and the Roman Christianity. The core of the new empire included what is now France, Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries. The empire laid the foundations for the medieval and early modern ''[[ancien regime]]'', finally destroyed only by the [[French Revolution]]. The Frankish-Catholic way of doing politics and war and religion also had a strong effect upon all neighbouring regions, including what became England, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Bohemia.\n\nThe effect of old Germanic culture on this new Latin-using empire is a topic of dispute, because there was much continuity with the old Roman legal systems, and the increasingly important Christian religion. An example which is argued to show an influence of earlier Germanic culture is law. The new kingdoms created new law codes in Latin, with occasional Germanic words.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}} These were Roman-influenced, and under strong church influence all law was increasingly standardized to accord with Christian philosophy, and old Roman law.{{sfn|Geary|2002|pp=123-128,137-138}}\n\nGermanic languages in western Europe also faded out of use in most areas apart from the West Germanic group of related languages including England, the \"[[Austrasia]]n\" Frankish homelands near the Lower Rhine, Maas and Scheldt rivers, and the large area between the Rhine and Elbe. With the splitting off of this latter area within the Frankish empire, the first ever political entity corresponding loosely to modern \"Germany\" came into existence.\n\nIn [[Eastern Europe]] the once relatively developed periphery of the Roman world collapsed culturally and economically, and this can be seen in the Germanic-associated archaeological evidence: in the area of today's southern Poland and Ukraine the collapse was not long after 400, and by 700 Germanic material culture was entirely west of the Elbe in the area where the Romans had been active since Caesar's time, and the Franks were now active. East of the Elbe was to become mainly [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speaking.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=371-372}}\n\nOutside of the Roman-influenced zone, Germanic-speaking Scandinavia was in the [[Vendel period]] and eventually entered the [[Viking Age]], with [[Viking expansion|expansion]] to [[Danelaw|Britain]], Ireland and [[history of Iceland|Iceland]] in the west and as far as [[Rus Khaganate|Russia]] and [[Varangians|Greece]] in the east.<ref>{{harvtxt|Derry|2012|pp=16\u201335}}; {{harvtxt|Clements|2005|pp=214\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=310}}</ref> Swedish Vikings, known locally as the [[Rus' people|Rus']], ventured deep into Russia, where they founded the political entities of [[Kievan Rus']].

On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries were, starting with Denmark, under the influence of Germany to their south, and also the lands where they had colonies. Bit by bit they became Christian, and organized themselves into Frankish- and Catholic-influenced kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire 11th century map-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Kingdom of Germany]] (''Regnum Teutonicum'') within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], circa 1000 AD]]\n\n==Roman descriptions of early Germanic people and culture==\n{{See|Germanic culture|Early Germanic culture}}\nCaesar and Tacitus gave colorful descriptions of the Germanic peoples, but scholars note that these need to be viewed cautiously. For one thing, many of the tropes used, such as concerning the red or blond hair, the blue eyes, and the undisciplined emotions of the Germanic peoples, were old ones that had long been used for any northern peoples such as Gauls. Secondly, the Germanic descriptions of both authors are recognized as having been intended to be both critical of Roman moral softness, and pushing for specific foreign policies.\n\nTacitus famously described the Germanic people as ethnically \"unmixed\", which had an influence on pre-1945 German racist nationalism. It was not necessarily meant to be purely positive:\n:For my own part, I agree with those who think that the tribes of Germany are free from all taint of inter-marriages with foreign nations, and that they appear as a distinct, unmixed race, like none but themselves. Hence, too, the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population. All have fierce blue eyes, red hair, huge frames, fit only for a sudden exertion. They are less able to bear laborious work. Heat and thirst they cannot in the least endure; to cold and hunger their climate and their soil inure them.<ref name=tac4>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:4 4].</ref>\n\nModern scholars point out that one way of interpreting such remarks is that it is consistent with other comments by Tacitus indicating that the Germanic people lived very remotely, in unattractive countries, for example in the next part of the text:\n:Their country, though somewhat various in appearance, yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps; it is more rainy on the side of Gaul, bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia. It is productive of grain, but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees; it is rich in flocks and herds, but these are for the most part undersized, and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head. <ref name=tac5>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:5 5].</ref>\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the early Germanic peoples were primarily agricultural, although husbandry and fishing were important sources of livelihood depending on the nature of the environment.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=166-174}} They carried out extensive trade with their neighbours, notably exporting amber, slaves, mercenaries and animal hides, and importing weapons, metals, glassware and coins in return.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=174-178}} They eventually came to excel at craftsmanship, particularly metalworking.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=23}} In many cases in fact, ancient Germanic smiths and other craftsmen produced products of higher quality than the Romans.{{Efn|\"Some smiths were able to rework iron into high-quality steel and make sword blades with a core of softer steel for flexibility and harder steel on the exterior to keep a sharp edge, far finer weapons than those used in the Roman army at the time.\"{{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=324}} \"Furthermore, the skills of Germanic smiths and other craftsmen were as good as, or better than those found inside the Roman empire.\"{{harvtxt|MacDowall|2000|p=16}} }}\n\nBefore Tacitus, Julius Caesar described the ''Germani'' and their customs in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', though in certain cases it is still a matter of debate if he refers to Northern [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes or clearly identified Germanic tribes. Caesar notes that the Gauls had earlier dominated and sent colonies into the lands of the Germans, but that the Gauls had since degenerated under the influence of Roman civilization, and now considered themselves inferior in military prowess.{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=156, 6.24}}: \"Proximity to our provinces and familiarity with seaborne imports bring the Gauls many things to use and keep, so they gradually grew accustomed to defeat, losing many battles and not even claiming to be the Germans' equals in courage now.\" {{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=29, 1.39}}: \"[O]ur men inquired and heard Gauls and merchants describing the Germans' huge bodies, their incredible strength, and their experience in arms. They had often encountered them and could not stand the sight of them or endure their gaze.

They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained [[chaste]] for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened.

Compare also to the influential old definition in German by the Grimm brothers for \"der Germane\" ({{harvcoltxt|Grimm|Grimm}}).}} They are also associated with [[Germanic languages]], which many of them probably spoke.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=3}}: \"There was a time where it was possible to say: 'The name Germanic peoples refers to those ethnic tribes who spoke a Germanic language'.\" {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|p=47}}: \"F\u00fcr die Zusammenarbeit der Disziplinen ist festzuhalten, dass die von der Philologie rekonstruierten Sprachen, wie eben das Germanische, Abstraktionen sind...\". {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"...there was always a problem with early Germanic because only fourth-century Gothic is extant as a written Germanic language prior to the ninth century...\"}} Starting with [[Julius Caesar]] (100-44 BCE), several Roman authors placed their homeland, ''[[Germania]]'', roughly between the [[Lower Rhine]] and the [[Vistula]], and distinguished them from other broad categories of peoples better known to Rome, especially the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gauls]] to their southwest, and \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" [[Sarmatians]] to their southeast.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=5-6}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Greek writers, in contrast, consistently categorized the Germanic peoples from east of the Rhine as a type of Gaul.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=51}}\n\nWith the possible exception of some tribes near the Rhine, there is no evidence that the Germanic peoples called themselves or their lands \"Germanic\" (see [[:#Definitions of Germanic peoples#Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"|below]]).<ref>{{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Latin and Greek writers report centuries of historical interactions with Germanic peoples on the Rhine and Danube, but from about 400, several long-established Germanic peoples on the [[Middle Danube]] were replaced by newcomers from the north or east. The description of peoples as \"Germanic\" in [[late antiquity]] was mainly restricted to the Rhine region, and thus especially referred to the [[Franks]], and sometimes also the [[Alamanni]].\n\nBroader modern definitions of the Germanic peoples include peoples who were not known as ''Germani'' or Germanic peoples in their own time, but who are treated as one group of cultures, mostly because of their use of Germanic languages.{{efn|This approach is sometimes questioned. {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"Concurrent with the creation of these linguistic theories, historians and politicians integrated them into their justifications and explanations of the rise of the nation-state, which is now again in question.\" {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014|p=520}}, using the [[Goths|Gothic peoples]] as an example: \"Linguistically, we can justify a grouping on the basis that all these peoples spoke a related form of Indo-European language, whether East, West or North Germanic. Such a modern definition, however, does not equate with the classical idea of the Germani.\" {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=222}}: \"No discernible benefit comes from out being reminded again and again in modern writings that many of these barbarians at each other's throats probably spoke dialects of the same language. The G-word can be dispensed with.\"}} Thus, in modern writing, \"Germanic peoples\" is a term which commonly includes peoples who were not referred to as Germanic by contemporaries, and spoke distinct languages, only categorized as Germanic in modern times. Examples include the late Roman [[Goths]], and the medieval [[Norse language|Norse]]-speaking Vikings.\n\nThe languages of the earliest known Germanic peoples of [[classical antiquity]] have left only fragmentary evidence. The first long texts which have survived were written outside ''Germania'' in the [[Gothic language]] from the region that is today [[Ukraine]] and in [[Old English]] from the British Isles.{{sfn|Todd|2004|p=11}} Languages in this family are widespread today in Europe, and have dispersed worldwide, the family being represented by major modern languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] and [[German language|German]]. The [[Eastern Germanic]] branch of the Germanic language family, once found in what is now Poland and the Ukraine, is extinct.\n\nApart from language and geography, proposed connections between the diverse Germanic peoples described by classical and medieval sources, archaeology, and linguistics are the subject of ongoing debate among scholars:\n*On the one hand there is doubt about whether late Roman-era Germanic peoples should be treated as unified by any single unique shared [[culture]], [[collective consciousness]], or even language.<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}}; {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|pp=47,50-51}}.</ref> For example, the tendency of some historians to describe late Roman historical events in terms of Germanic language speakers has been criticized by other scholars because it implies a single coordinated group. [[Walter Goffart]] has gone so far as to suggest that historians should avoid the term when discussing that period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc=Preface}}: \"Strange as it may seem to hear it said, there were no Germanic peoples in late antiquity. The illusion that there were can be outgrown.\"</ref>\n*On the other hand, there is a connected debate concerning the extent to which any significant Germanic traditions apart from language, even smaller scale tribal traditions, survived ''after'' Roman times, when new political entities formed in Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some of these new entities are seen as precursors of European [[nation states]] that have survived into modern times, such as [[English people|England]] and [[French people|France]], and so such proposed connections back to medieval and classical barbarian nations were important to many of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[nationalist]] movements, which developed across Europe in modern times{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=13}} (The most notable of these has been \"[[Germanicism]]\", which saw [[Germans]] especially as direct heirs of a single Europe-conquering Germanic race and culture - a popular narrative which helped inspire [[Nazism]].<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}.</ref>) In contrast, more complex proposals about continuity today, such as those proposed by [[:de:Reinhard Wenskus|Reinhard Wenskus]], tend to focus on the possibility of more limited \"kernels\" of cultural traditions, which can be carried by relatively small groups with, or without, large-scale migrations.<ref>Examples: {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=13-14,19-20}}; {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=50-51}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, genetic studies have begun to look more systematically at questions of ancestry, using both modern and ancient DNA. However, the connection between modern Germanic languages, ethnicity and genetic heritage is thought by many scholars to be unlikely to ever be simple or uncontroversial. [[Guy Halsall]] for example writes: \"The danger, barely addressed (at best dismissed as a purely \u2018ideological\u2019 objection), is of reducing ethnicity to biology and thus to something close to the nineteenth-century idea of race, at the basis of the \u2018nation state\u2019.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=518}}\n{{TOC limit|5}}\n\n==Definitions of Germanic peoples==\n{{Split section portions|date=March 2020|discuss=Talk:Germanic peoples#An article to define the scope of another article?}}\n===General===\nPossibly based on discussions with Gaulish allies during [[Gallic Wars|his campaign]] there, Julius Caesar published the first basic definition of what makes any people or peoples \"Germanic\", rather than for example Gaulish.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=52-53}} This definition involved several criteria, allowing the possibility of debatable cases.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=100}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=8-10}}.</ref> Definitions of Germanic peoples continue to involve discussion of similar criteria:\n\n*Geography. The Germanic peoples are seen as peoples who originated, before Caesar's time, from somewhere between the Lower Rhine and Lower Vistula, so-called ''\"[[Germania]]\"''. Already for Caesar, use of this definition requires knowing which people moved away from this homeland.\n*Language. Tacitus already referred to Suebian languages as a way of determining if a people was Germanic. Scholars defined a family of Germanic languages, which at least some of the ''Germani'' spoke, for example the Suevi. \n*[[Culture]], in the sense of clothing, economy, cults, laws and lifestyle of the different Germanic peoples was already used by Tacitus and Caesar to help distinguish the ''Germani'' from other northern peoples. In modern times, archaeologists study the surviving physical evidence left by the peoples of ''Germania'', and they have defined various regional cultures. Of these, there is consensus that at least the [[Jastorf culture]], between the Elbe and [[Oder]] rivers, was Germanic-speaking already in the time of Caesar. In parallel, other scholars have looked for textual fragmentary evidence concerning the laws, legends and cults of these peoples, and scholars such as [[Dennis Howard Green]] have sought leads in the Germanic languages themselves.{{sfn|Green|2007}}\n\nIn modern times, attempts to define characteristics which unite all or some of these peoples more objectively, using linguistic or archaeological criteria, have thus led to the possibility of the term \"Germanic\" being used to apply to more peoples, in other periods and regions. However, these definitions are still based upon the old definitions, and overlap with them.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|p=9-10}}: \"Die Sprachwissenschaft kann weiterhin nach bestimmten Kriterien, etwa de 1. Lautverscheibung, die Entstehung der germanischen Sprache(n) definieren und grob zeitlich und r\u00e4umlch einordnen.

Importantly for all future conceptions of what Germanic means, Caesar was apparently the first to categorize distant peoples such as the [[Cimbri]] and the large group of [[Suevi|Suebian peoples]] as \"Germanic\".{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1998|loc=p.6 col.2}} The Suevians and their languages, which had perhaps never been called Germanic before then, had started expanding their influence in his time, as Caesar experienced personally.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=13}} Caesar's categorization of the ''Germani'' was in the context of explaining his battle against [[Ariovistus]], who had been a Roman ally. He led a large and armed population, made up of several peoples from east of the Rhine, including significant Suebian contingents.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.51 1.51]. Also Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, and Sedusii were listed. See [[Germanic_peoples#1st_century_BCE:_Julius_Caesar|below]].</ref> Rome had suffered a history of Gaulish invasions from the distant north, including those by the [[Cimbri]], whom they had previously categorized as Gauls. Caesar, while describing his subsequent use of Roman soldiers deep in Gaulish territory, categorized the Cimbri, together with the peoples allied under Ariovistus, not as Gaulish, but as \"Germanic\", apparently using an ethnic term that was more local to the Rhine region where he fought Ariovistus. Modern scholars are undecided about whether the Cimbri were Germanic speakers like the Suebians, and even where exactly they lived in northern Europe, though it is likely to have been in or near [[Jutland]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=11}}; {{harvtxt|Kaul|Martens|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=282}}.</ref> Caesar thus proposed that these more distant peoples were the cause of invasions into Italy. His solution was controlling Gaul, and defending the Rhine as a boundary against these ''Germani''.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=9-10}}\n\nSeveral Roman writers\u2014[[Strabo]] (about 63 BCE \u2013 24 CE), [[Pliny the Elder]] (about 23\u201379 CE), and especially [[Tacitus]] (about 56\u2013120 CE)\u2014followed Caesar's tradition in the next few generations, by partly defining the Germanic peoples of their time geographically, according to their presumed homeland. This \"''Germania magna''\", or Greater ''Germania'', was seen as a large wild country roughly east of the [[Rhine]], and north of the [[Danube]], but not everyone from within the area bounded by those rivers was ever described by Roman authors as Germanic, and not all ''Germani'' lived there.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2002|p=59-60}} The opening of Tacitus's ''Germania'' gave a rough definition only:\n<blockquote>Germania is separated from the Gauls, the [[Rhaetians]], and [[List_of_ancient_tribes_in_Illyria#Pannonian_tribes|Pannonii]], by the rivers Rhine and Danube. Mountain ranges, or the fear which each feels for the other, divide it from the [[Sarmatians]] and [[Dacians]].<ref name=tac1>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:1 1].</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is the northern part of Greater ''Germania'', including the [[North European Plain]], Southern [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast that was presumed to be the original Germanic homeland by early Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus. (Modern scholars also see the central part of this area, between the Elbe and the Oder, as the region from which Germanic languages dispersed.<ref>See [[Germanic_peoples#Languages|below]].</ref>) In the east, ''Germania magna's'' boundaries were unclear according to Tacitus, although geographers such as Ptolemy and [[Pomponius Mela]] took it to be the [[Vistula]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:45 45]-[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Ptolemy, ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/3/5*.html 3.5] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/10/limited.html 2.10]; Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015042048507?urlappend=%3Bseq=122 31].</ref> For Tacitus the boundaries of Germania stretched further, to somewhere east of the Baltic Sea in the north, and its people blended with the \"Scythian\" (or Sarmatian) steppe peoples in the area of today's [[Ukraine]] in the south. In the north, greater ''Germania'' stretched all the way to the relatively unknown [[Arctic Ocean]]. In contrast, in the south of Greater ''Germania'' nearer the Danube, the Germanic peoples were seen by these Roman writers as immigrants or conquerors, living with other peoples whom they had come to dominate. More specifically, Tacitus noted various [[Suebi]]an Germanic-speaking peoples from the [[Elbe|Elbe river]] in the north, such as the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], pushing into the [[Hercynian forest]] regions towards the Danube, where the Gaulish [[Volcae]], [[Helvetii]] and [[Boii]] had lived.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'' 6.24; Tacitus, ''Germania''\n[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:28 28]; {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|loc=p.6,p.53}}.</ref>\n\nRoman writers who added to Caesar's theoretical description, especially Tacitus, also at least partly defined the ''Germani'' by non-geographic criteria such as their economy, religion, clothing, and language. Caesar had, for example, previously noted that the ''Germani'' had no [[druids]], and were less interested in farming than Gauls, and also that [[Gaulish]] (''lingua gallica'') was a language the Germanic King Ariovistus had to learn.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=6}}<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.47 1.47], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.21 6.21].</ref> Tacitus mentioned Germanic language at least three times, all concerning eastern peoples whose ethnicity was uncertain, and such remarks are seen by some modern authors as evidence of a unifying Germanic language.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|loc=p.95 n.4; p.97}} for example, argues that Tacitus described the ''Germani'' as united by language.</ref> His comments are not detailed, but they indicate that there were Suebian languages (plural) ''within'' the category of Germanic languages, and that customs varied between different Germanic peoples. For example:{{sfn|Pohl|2006|p=121}}\n*The [[Marsigni]] and [[Buri tribe|Buri]], near today's southern [[Silesia]], were Suebian in speech and culture and therefore among the ''Germani'' in a region where he says non-Germanic people also lived.<ref name=tac43>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:43 43]. For the position of the Buri, there is also reference in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geography'' of Germany.</ref>\n*The peoples (''gentes'') of the [[Aesti]], on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, had the same customs and attire as the Germanic Suebians although \"their language more resembles that of Britain\".<ref name=tac45>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:45 45]: ''\"Aestiorum gentes [...], quibus ritus habitusque Sueborum\", lingua Britannicae propior\".''</ref> (They are seen today as speakers of [[Baltic languages]], a language group in the same Indo-European language family as Germanic and Celtic.)\n*As mentioned above, the [[Peucini]], called by some Bastarn\u00e6, are like ''Germani'' in their speech, cultivation, and settlements.<ref name=tac46>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46].</ref> (However, Livy says that their language was like that of the [[Scordisci]], a Celtic group.)\nTacitus says nothing about the languages of the ''Germani'' living near the Rhine.\n\n===Origin of the \"Germanic\" terminology===\nThe etymology of the Latin word \"Germani\", from which Latin ''Germania'', and English \"Germanic\" are derived, is unknown, although several different proposals have been made. Even the language from which it derives is a subject of dispute.{{efn|See for example {{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}} and {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=80}}. The latter gives a detailed summary of some of the many proposals. {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=5}}, for example, thinks \"Germani\" must be Gaulish. Historian Wolfgang Pfeifer more or less concurs with Wolfram and surmises that the name Germani is likely of Celtic etymology, related in this case to the Old Irish word ''gair'' (neighbors) or could be tied to the Celtic word for their war cries ''gairm'', which simplifies into \"the neighbors\" or \"the screamers\".{{sfn|Pfeifer|2000|p=434}} But there is no consensus.}}\nWhatever it meant, the name probably applied originally only to a smaller group of people, the so-called \"''[[Germani cisrhenani]]''\", whose Latin scholarly name simply indicates that these were ''Germani'' living on the western side of the Rhine (see below).<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=4-5}}; {{harvtxt|Petrikovits|1999}}</ref> Tacitus reported that these Germanic peoples in Gaul, ancestors of the [[Tungri]] in his time, were the first people to be called ''Germani''.<ref name=tac2>Tacitus ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:2 2]).</ref> According to Tacitus, their name had transferred to peoples such as those within the alliance of [[Ariovistus]], as a name having connotations that frightened potential enemies. While Caesar and Tacitus saw this Rhineland people as Germanic in the broader sense also, they do not fit easily with the much broader definitions of \"Germanic\" used by them or modern scholars. These original ''Germani'' are therefore a significant complication for all attempts to define the Germanic peoples according to which side of the Rhine they lived on, or according to their probable language.\n\n[[File:Two types of Germani.png|thumb|300px|The two main types of \"Germani\" in the time of Julius Caesar. (Approximate positions only.) Later Roman imperial provinces shown with red shading. On the Rhine are ''Germania Inferior'' (north) and ''Germania Superior'' (south).]]\nCaesar described how the country of these ''Germani cisrhenani'' stretched well west of the Lower Rhine, into modern [[Belgium]], and it had done so long before the Romans came into close contact. Neither Caesar nor Tacitus saw this as clashing with their broader definitions, because they believed these ''Germani'' had moved from east of the Rhine, where the other ''Germani'' lived. But this was not recent: Caesar reported that they were already on the west side during the [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101 BCE), generations earlier.<ref>Caesar, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:2.4 2.4].</ref> The early ''Germani'' on both sides of the Lower Rhine were however distinguished from the Suebian ''Germani'' by Caesar, Tacitus, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo. Strabo even said that the ''Germani'' near the Rhine not only differed little from the Celts, but also that the Latin-speakers called them \"Germani\" because they were the \"genuine\" Gauls (which is a possible meaning of ''Germani'' in Latin).<ref name=strabo>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.2 7.1.2].</ref> Pliny the Elder and Tacitus reported a tradition that the Lower Rhine ''Germani'' could be distinguished from the \"[[Ingaevones]]\" (who lived on the North Sea coast) as \"the [[Istaevones]]\", and the \"[[Herminones]]\" (who included the Suebian peoples) living inland of these groups (see below). Modern historical linguists and archaeologists have also come to doubt that these western ''Germani'' spoke a Germanic language as defined today, or shared the same [[material culture]], at least at the time of their first contact with Caesar and the Romans.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Roymans|2014|p=29}}: \"The archaeology of the Late Iron Age argues for a north-south articulation of the northwest European continent, in which the Rhine does not function as a cultural boundary. On the contrary, groups in the southern Netherlands and northern Belgium as well as in Hessen and southern Westphalia were strongly influenced by the La T\u00e8ne culture, as is shown by the presence of central places, sanctuaries, specialist glass and metalworking, and the adoption of coinage.\"}} Caesar himself refers to them also as Gauls.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic War'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.34 6.34], for example, refers to the main tribe of these ''Germani'', the [[Eburones]] as Gauls.</ref>\n\nThe older concept of the ''Germani'' being local to the Rhine remained common among Graeco-Roman writers for a longer time than the more theoretical and general concept of Caesar.

It is believed by many scholars that the inscription should originally have referred to these Gaesatae.{{sfn|Polverini|1994|page=2}}\n*A third author sometimes thought to have written about the Germani is [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille]], who wrote about northern Europe, but his works have not survived. Later reports of his writings show that he wrote about the areas and tribes later called Germanic but do not necessarily show that he called them Germanic.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}} (For example, Pliny the Elder says he described the Baltic Sea and mentioned a large country of \"Guiones\", often interpreted as the [[Gutones]], described by Tacitus. Their land included an estuary that is one day's sail from an island where [[amber]] was collected, which in turn neighbours the [[Teutones]], but an alternative interpretation is that these were (In)guiones (see below) on the North Sea coast.<ref>Pliny the elder, ''Natural History'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.27 4.27(/\"13\")] and [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:37.11 37.11(/\"7\")]. See {{harvtxt|Timpe|1989|p=330}}.</ref>)\n\nAfter Caesar, Roman authors such as Tacitus followed his example in using the Germanic terminology to refer retroactively to peoples known to the Romans or Greeks before Caesar. As noted above, the Cimbri had previously been described as Celtic or [[Cimmerian]], and Greek writers continued to do so, while  Caesar described them as Germanic. Tacitus and Strabo both proposed with some uncertainty that the [[Bastarnae]], a large people known to the Graeco-Roman world before Caesar, from the region of what is now [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Ukrainian Galicia]] and [[Moldavia|Moldava]], might also have had mixed Germanic ancestry, and according to Tacitus, even a Germanic language. Pliny the Elder categorized them as a separate major division of the ''Germani'' like Istvaeones, Ingvaeones, and Irminones, but also separate from an eastern group which contained the [[Vandals]] and the [[Gutones]], both in what is now Poland.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.3.17 7.3.17]; Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Pliny, ''Natural History'',[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28].</ref> (As already mentioned however, [[Livy]] said they spoke a language like the [[Scordisci]].<ref>Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|History of Rome]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi00140.perseus-eng3:57 40.57].</ref>)\n\n===Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"===\nThe theoretical descriptions of Germanic peoples by Tacitus, which have been very influential in modern times, may never have been commonly read or used in the Roman era.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}} It is clear in any case that in later Roman times the Rhine frontier (or ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), the area where Caesar had first come in contact with Suevians and ''Germani cisrhenani'', was the normal \"Germanic\" area mentioned in writing. [[Walter Goffart]] has written that \"the one incontrovertible Germanic thing\" in the Roman era was \"the two Roman provinces of 'Germania,' on the middle and lower course of the Rhine river\" and: \"Whatever 'Germania' had meant to Tacitus, it had narrowed by the time of [[Jerome|St Jerome]] to an archaic or poetic term for the land normally called [[Austrasia|Francia]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=187}} and {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=112-113}}.</ref> Edward James similarly wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems clear that in the fourth century 'German' was no longer a term which included all western barbarians. [...] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], in the later fourth century, only uses ''Germania'' when he is referring to the Roman provinces of Upper Germany and Lower Germany; east of ''Germania'' are ''Alamannia'' and ''Francia''.{{sfn|James|2009|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\nAs an exceptional case, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], living in what is now southern France, described the [[Burgundians]] of his time as speaking a \"Germanic\" tongue and being \"''Germani''\". Wolfram has proposed that this word was chosen not because of a comparison of languages, but because the Burgundians had come from the Rhine region, and even argued that the use of this word by Sidonius might be seen as evidence against Burgundians being speakers of [[East Germanic]], given that the East Germanic speaking Goths, also present in southern France at this time, were never described this way.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=259}} cites his letter 5, to his friend Syagrius. In contrast, the use of this word by Sidonius is apparently seen differently for example by {{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=157}}, citing Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Carm.'' 12.4.}}\n\nFar from the Rhine, the Gothic peoples in what is today Ukraine, and the Anglo-Saxons in the British Isles, were only called Germanic in one surviving classical text, by [[Zosimus]] (5th century), but only in a case where he mistakenly believed he was writing about Rhineland peoples.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=172}} Otherwise, Goths and similar peoples such as the Gepids, were consistently described as Scythian.\n\n===Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept===\nIn the Greek-speaking eastern Roman empire which continued to exist in the Middle ages, the Germanic concept was also lost or distorted. As explained by Walter Pohl, the late Roman equation of the Franks to the Germani led there to such non-classical contrasts as the French (West Franks) being ''Germani'' and the Germans (East Franks) being ''Alamanni'', or the [[Italo-Normans|Normans in Sicily]] being Franks, but the French being \"Franks and also ''Germani''\". In the [[Strategikon of Maurice|''Strategikon'' of Maurice]], written about 600, a contrast is made between three types of barbarian: Scythians, [[Slavs]], and \"blonde-haired\" peoples such as the Franks and Langobards - apparently having no convenient name to cover them together.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|pp=171-172}}\n\nMedieval writers in western Europe used Caesar's old geographical concept of ''Germania'', which, like the new Frankish and clerical jurisdictions of their time, used the Rhine as a frontier marker, although they did not commonly refer to any contemporary ''Germani''. For example, [[Louis the German]] (''{{lang|la|Ludovicus Germanicus}}'') was named this way because he ruled east of the Rhine, and in contrast the kingdom west of the Rhine was still called ''Gallia'' (Gaul) in scholarly Latin.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=11}}\n\nWriters using Latin in [[West Germanic]]-speaking areas did recognize that those languages were related (Dutch, English, [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], and German). To describe this they referred to \"Teutonic\" words and languages, seeing this as a Latin translation of ''[[Theodiscus]]'', which was a concept that West Germanic speakers used to refer to themselves. It is the source of the modern words \"[[wikt:Dutch|Dutch]]\", German \"[[wikt:Deutsch|Deutsch]]\", and Italian \"[[wikt:Tedesco|Tedesco]]\". [[Romance language]] speakers and others such as the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] were contrasted using words based on another old word, ''[[Walhaz]]'', the source of \"Welsh\", [[Wallach]], [[Welsch]], [[wikt:Walloon|Walloon]], etc., itself coming from the name of the [[Volcae]], a Celtic tribe.<ref name=\"Ringe 2009\">Ringe, Don. \"[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1012 Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence].\" ''Language Log,'' January 2009.</ref> Only a small number of writers were influenced by Tacitus, whose work was known at [[Fulda Abbey]], and few used terminology such as ''lingua Germanica'' instead of ''theudiscus sermo''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc= p.278 & 282}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there were several more origin myths written after Jordanes (see above) which similarly connected some of the post Roman peoples to a common origin in Scandinavia. As pointed out by Walter Pohl, Paul the Deacon even implied that the Goths, like the Lombards, ''descended from'' \"Germanic peoples\", though it is unclear if they continued to be \"Germanic\" after leaving the north.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} [[Freculf|Frechulf of Lisieux]], noted that some believed that the Goths might belong to the \"''nationes Theotistae''\", like the Franks, and that both the Franks and the Goths might have come from Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=46}} It is in this period, the 9th century [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], that scholars are also first recorded speculating about relationships between Gothic and West Germanic languages. [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]] believed the Goths spoke a ''teodisca lingua'' like the Franks, and [[Walafrid Strabo]], calling it a ''theotiscus sermo'', was even aware of their Bible translation. However, though the similarities were noticed, Gothic would not have been intelligible to a West Germanic speaker.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=409-413}}\n\nThe first detailed origins legend of the Anglo-Saxons was by [[Bede]] (died 735), and in his case he named the Angles and Saxons of Britain as tribes who once lived in ''Germania'', like, he says, the [[Frisians]], [[Rugians]], [[Danes]], [[Huns]], Old [[Saxons]] (''Antiqui Saxones'') and the [[Bructeri]]. He even says that British people still call them, corruptly, ''\"Garmani\"''. As with Jordanes and the Gutones, there is other evidence, linguistic and archaeological, which is consistent with his scholarly account, although this does not prove that Bede's non-scholarly contemporaries had accurate knowledge of historical details.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|p=198}}; Bede, ''History'', [https://archive.org/details/venerablebedesec00bede/page/246/mode/2up 5.9].</ref>\n\nIn western Europe then, there was a small scholarly awareness of the Tacitean \"Germanic peoples\", and even their potential connection to the Goths, but much more common were adherence to Caesar's concept of the geographical meaning of ''Germania'' east of the Rhine, and a perception of similarities between some Germanic languages - though they were not given this name until much later.\n\n\n==Later debates==\n===The influence of Jordanes and the ''Origo Gentes'' genre===\nThe ethnic military kingdoms which formed in the western Roman empire (see [[Germanic peoples#5th century. The western empire divided into kingdoms|below]]) each developed their own legends about their ethnic origins, the so-called ''[[Origo gentis]]'' stories. These often included an ancient connection to Romans or [[Troy|Trojans]], as apparently in the stories of the Franks, Burgundians and English, and they also typically mentioned the wild east of \"Scythia\". However, [[Jordanes]] (6th century), who wrote the most detailed surviving Gothic origins story, did effectively propose a connection to northern regions which much earlier authors had described as the remotest parts of ''Germania'', and established a tradition of connecting the earliest origins of Goths and other peoples to [[Scandza|Scandinavia]], which was for him a distant and almost unknown island. He thus connected the Goths (''Gothi'') not only with ancient Amazons, Trojans, Huns, and the similarly-named [[Getae]], but also to the Baltic sea. Some modern writers, such as Wolfram and Heather, still see this as confirmed by the mention of similar sounding \"Gutones\" near the south Baltic coast in earlier authors such as Tacitus and Ptolemy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=115}} Others have noted that Jordanes himself believed the Goths would have left the region centuries before those writers, making the identification doubtful. Indeed, he or his sources must have derived the many of the names of ancient peoples and places from reading old Latin and Greek authors.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nVery influentially, Jordanes called Scandinavia a \"womb of nations\" (''vagina nationum''), asserting that many peoples came from there in prehistoric times. This idea influenced later origin legends including the Lombard origin story, written by [[Paul the Deacon]] (8th century) who opens his work with an explanation of this theory. During the Carolingian renaissance he and other scholars even sometimes used the Germanic terminology.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} (See [[Germanic peoples#Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept|below]].) The Scandinavian theme continued to be influential in medieval times and has even been influential in early modern speculations about Germanic peoples, for example in proposals about not only Goths and Gepids, but also [[Rugii|Rugian]] and Burgundian origins.\n\nThe continuing use of Jordanes and similar writers to attempt to prove that the Goths were \"Germanic\" in more than language continues to arouse debate among scholars, because while his work is unreliable, the Baltic connection on its own is consistent with linguistic and archaeological evidence.<ref>Concerning the archaeological evidence, for the Gothic peoples see {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=120}}.</ref> However, Walter Goffart in particular has criticized the methodology of many modern scholars for using Jordanes and other origins stories as independent sources of real tribal memories, but only when it matches their beliefs arrived at in other ways.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|page=46-47}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Modern \"Germanic\" debates and \"Germanism\"===\n{{See|Pan-Germanism|Viking revival|Gothicism|}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 118-30, Hermanns-Denkmal, Jungdeutsche Tagung.jpg|thumbnail|300px|An event of the [[Young German Order]] at the \"[[Hermannsdenkmal]]\" monument to [[Arminius]], in 1925.

The artwork depicts Arminius saying farewell to his beloved wife before he goes off into battle.|330x330px]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] there was a rediscovery and renewed interest in secular writings of [[classical antiquity]]. By the late 15th century, [[Tacitus]] had become a focus of interest all around Europe, and, among other effects, this revolutionized ideas in Germany concerning the history of Germany itself. Tacitus continues to be an important influence in Germanic studies of antiquity, and is often read together with the ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]]', who wrote much later.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=43, pp.48ff}}\n<blockquote>Tacitus's ethnography won the attention it had formerly been denied because there now was a Germany, the \"German nation\" that had come into existence since the Carolingians, which Tacitus could now equip with a heaven-sent ancient dignity and pedigree.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nIn this context, in the 19th century, the famous [[folklorist]] and linguist [[Jacob Grimm]] helped popularize the concept of Germanic languages as well as of [[Indo-european languages]]. Apart from the well-known [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], collected with [[Wilhelm Grimm|his brother Wilhelm]], he published, for example, ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' attempting to reconstruct [[Germanic mythology]], and a German dictionary ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' with detailed etymological proposals attempting to reconstruct the oldest Germanic language. He also popularized a new idea of these Germanic speakers, especially those in Germany, clinging valiantly to their supposed Germanic civilization over the centuries.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=48}} says: \"A whole library of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarship can be evoked to show that a \"Germanic antiquity\" existed in parallel to its Greco-Roman counterpart.\"}}\n\nThe subsequently popular modern assertion of strong cultural continuity between Roman-era ''Germani'' and medieval or modern Germanic speakers, especially Germans, assumed a strong connection between a family trees of language categories, and both cultural and racial heritages. The name of the newly defined language family, ''Germanic'', was long unpopular in other countries such as England, where the medieval \"Teutonic\" was seen as less potentially misleading.{{sfn|Chadwick|1945|p=143}} Similarly, in Denmark \"Gothic\" was sometimes used as a term for the language group uniting the ''Germani'' and the Goths, and a modified Gothonic was proposed by [[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]] and used locally.{{sfn|Nielsen|2004}}\n\nThis [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[nationalist]] approach has been rejected in its simplest forms since approximately [[World War II]]. For example, the once common habit of referring to Roman-era Germanic peoples as \"[[Germans]]\" is discouraged by modern historians, and modern [[Germans]] are no longer seen as the main successors of the ''Germani''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|loc=Introduction}} Not only are ideas associated with [[Nazism]] now criticized, but also other romanticized ideas about the Germanic peoples. For example, Guy Halsall has mentioned the popularity of the \"view of the peoples of Germania as, essentially, proto-democratic communes of freemen\".{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=516}} And [[Peter Heather]] has pointed out also that the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory \"that some of Europe's barbarians were ultimately responsible for moving Europe onwards to the [[feudalism|feudal]] modern of production has also lost much of its force\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=614}}\n\nFurther, some historians now question whether there was any unifying Germanic culture even in Roman times, and secondly whether there was any significant continuity at all apart from language, connecting the Roman era Germanic peoples with the mixed new ethnic groups who formed in [[late antiquity]]. Skeptics of such connections include [[Walter Goffart]], and others associated with him and [[Toronto University]].{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=18}} Goffart lists four \"contentions\" about how the Germanic terminology biases the conclusions of historians, and is therefore misleading:{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=7}}\n:1. Barbarian invasions should not be seen as a single collective movement. Different barbarian groups moved for their own reasons under their own leaders.\n:2. The pressures on the late Empire did not have a united source, and often came from within.\n:3. The classical Germanic peoples lacked any unity or center, and so they should not be seen as a civilization in the way Rome is.\n:4. We should not, according to Goffart, accept Jordanes as preserving an authentic oral tradition about a migration from Scandinavia.\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility of a small but significant \"core of tradition\" (''[[wikt:de:Traditionskern|Traditionskern]]'') surviving with the ruling classes of Roman Germanic peoples, in the societies of new medieval Germanic speaking peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Goths]], continues to be defended by other historians. This ''Traditionskern'' concept is associated for example with the [[Vienna School of History]], initiated by [[Reinhard Wenskus]], and later represented by scholars such as [[Herwig Wolfram]] and [[Walter Pohl]].\n\nPeter Heather for example, continues to use the Germanic terminology but writes that concerning proposals of Germanic continuity, \"all subsequent discussion has accepted and started from Wenskus's basic observations\" and \"the ''Germani'' in the first millenium were thus not closed groups with continuous histories\".{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=19}} Heather however believes that such caution now often goes too far in denying any large scale movements of people in specific cases, exemplified by [[Patrick Amory]]'s explanation of the [[Ostrogoths]] and their [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom]] of Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2007}}\n\nAnother proponent of relatively significant continuity, [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]], has argued that the shared use of Germanic languages by, for example, Anglo-Saxons and Goths, implies that they must have had more links to ''Germania'' than only language. While little concrete evidence has survived, Liebeschuetz proposes that the existence of [[Weregild]] laws, stipulating compensation payments to avoid blood feuds, must be Germanic because such laws were not Roman.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|pp=94-96}} Liebeschuetz also argues that recent sceptical scholars \"deprive the ancient Germans and their constituent tribes of any continuous identity\" and this is \"important\" because it makes European history a product of Roman history, not \"a joint creation of Roman and Germans\".{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=90}}[[File:Nordic Bronze Age.png|thumb|upright=1|Map of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, around 1200 BCE]]\n\n==Prehistoric evidence==\n{{Further|Pre-Roman Iron Age}}\n[[File:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The Dejbjerg wagon, National Museum of Denmark]]\n\nCaesar, the original of the idea of the Germanic peoples, believed that in prehistory, before his time, the Rhine had divided these ''Germani'' from the Gauls. However, he noted that there must have already been significant movements in both directions, over the Rhine. Not only did he believe that the ''Germani'' have a long-standing tendency to make raids and group movements from the northeast, involving Germanic peoples such as the Cimbri long before him, and the Suevians in his time, it was also his understanding that there had been a time when the movement went in the opposite direction:\n<blockquote>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans [''Germani''] in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine . Accordingly, the [[Volcae]] [[Tectosages]], seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known by report to [[Eratosthenes]] and some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.24 6.24]</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern archaeologists disagree with this assessment and see no sign of such movements, seeing the Gaulish [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] as native to what is now southern Germany, and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures on both sides of the Lower Rhine in this period quite distinct from the Elbe Germanic peoples. On the other hand, the account of Caesar finds broad agreement with the archaeological record of the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture first expanding to the north, influencing all cultures there, and then suddenly becoming scarce in the north. Subsequently the Jastorf culture expanded in all directions from the region between the lower Elbe and Oder rivers.\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic language|List of Germanic languages}}\nIt is believed that most of the early Germanic peoples spoke [[Germanic languages]].{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2006|p=49|}} \"Germanic-speaking groups dominated most of central and northern Europe beyond Rome's riverine frontiers.

In England and Frisia around 500 A.D., this rune came now to be used for \u00e6, which was the result of fronting (\u00a733).|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hines|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7Q4DwAAQBAJ|title=Frisians and Their North Sea Neighbours: From the Fifth Century to the Viking Age|date=2017|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-1-78327-179-5|editor-last=Hines|editor-first=John|location=|pages=30|language=en|chapter=The Anglo-Frisian Question|ref=harv|editor-last2=IJssennagger|editor-first2=Nelleke}}</ref>\n:*[[List of Germanic languages#Continental West Germanic|Continental West Germanic]] including [[Old Dutch]], [[Low German]], and [[High German]].

These La T\u00e8ne peoples, who included the ''Germani cisrhenani'', are generally considered unlikely to have spoken Germanic languages as defined today, though some may have spoken unknown related languages or Celtic dialects. To the north of these zones however, in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the archaeological cultures started to become more distinct from La T\u00e8ne culture during the Iron Age.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martens|2014}}</ref>\n\nConcerning Germanic speakers within these northern regions, the relatively well-defined [[Jastorf culture]] matches with the areas described by Tacitus, Pliny the elder and Strabo as Suevian homelands near the lower River Elbe, and stretching east on the Baltic coast to the [[Oder river]]. The Suevian peoples are seen by scholars as early [[West Germanic]] speakers. There is no consensus about whether neighbouring cultures in Scandinavia, Poland, and northwestern Germany were also part of a Germanic (or proto-Germanic)-speaking community at first, but this group of cultures were related to each other, and in contact. To the west of the Elbe for example, on what is now the German North Sea coast, was the so-called [[:de:Harpstedt-Nienburger Gruppe|Harpstedt-Nienburger Group]] between the Jastorf culture and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures of the Lower Rhine. To the east in what is now Poland was the [[Oksywie culture]], in the area where the later [[Wielbark culture]] developed, probably with the entry of [[East Germanic]] speakers. Related also to these and the Jastorf culture, was the [[Przeworsk culture]], which began as another La T\u00e8ne influenced local culture, and apparently became at least partly Germanic-speaking.\n\nThe Jastorf culture came into most direct contact with La T\u00e8ne cultures on the upper Elbe and Oder rivers, believed to correspond to the Celtic-speaking groups such as the Boii and Volcae described in this area by Roman sources. In the south of their range, the Jastorf and Przeworsk material cultures spread together, in the same direction.\n\n==Classical subdivisions==\n{{Further|Ing\u00e6vones|Herminones|Ist\u00e6vones}}\nBy the 1st century CE, the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] reported a division of Germanic peoples into large groupings. Tacitus, in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', specifically stated that one such division mentioned \"in old songs\" (''carminibus antiquis'') derived three such groups from three brothers, sons of [[Mannus]], who was son of an earth-born god, [[Tuisco|Tuisto]]. These terms are also sometimes used in older modern linguistic terminology, attempting to describe the divisions of later Germanic languages:\n*[[Ingvaeones]], nearest to the Ocean.\n*[[Herminones]] in the interior.\n*[[Istvaeones]], the remainder.<ref name=tac2/>\n\nOn the other hand, he wrote in the same passage that some believe that there are other groups which are just as old as these three, including \"the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suevi, Vandilii\". Of these, Tacitus only discussed the Suebi in detail, specifying that they were a very large grouping, with many tribes, with their own names. The largest, he said, was the [[Semnones]] near the Elbe, who \"claim that they are the oldest and the noblest of the Suebi.\"<ref name=tac2/>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], somewhat similarly, named five races of Germani in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', with the same basic three groups as Tacitus, plus two more eastern blocks of Germans, the [[Vandals]], and further east the [[Bastarnae]]. He clarifies that the Istvaeones are near the Rhine, although he only gives one problematic example, the Cimbri. He also clarifies that the Suevi, though numerous, are actually in one of the three Mannus groups. His list:<ref> Plin. Nat. [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28]</ref>\n*The [[Vandals|Vandili]], include the [[Burgundiones]], the [[Varini]], the [[Carini (Germanic tribe)|Carini]], and the [[Gutones]]. The Varini are listed by Tacitus as being Suebic, and the Gutones are described by him as Germanic, leaving open the question of whether they are Suebian.\n*The Ing\u00e6vones include the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the [[Chauci]].\n*The Ist\u00e6vones, who \"join up to the Rhine\", and including the Cimbri [sic, repeated, probably by error]\n*The Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the [[Hermunduri]], the [[Chatti]], the [[Cherusci]],\n*The Peucini, who are also the [[Bastarnae|Bastern\u00e6]], adjoining the [[Dacians|Daci]].\n\nThese accounts and others from the period emphasize that the Suebi formed an especially large and powerful group. Tacitus speaks also of a geographical \"Suevia\" with two halves either side of the [[Sudetes]].<ref name=tac43/> The larger group that the Suevi were part of according to Pliny, the Hermiones, is mentioned in one other source: [[Pomponius Mela]] in his slightly earlier ''Description of the World,'' places \"the farthest people of [[Germania]], the Hermiones\" somewhere to the east of the Cimbri and the Teutones, apparently on the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]]. He did not mention Suebians.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', trans. F.E. Romer, 3.31\u20133.32</ref>\n\nStrabo, who focused mainly on ''Germani'' between the Elbe and Rhine, and does not mention the sons of Mannus, also set apart the names of ''Germani'' who are ''not'' Suevian, in two other groups, similarly implying three main divisions: \"smaller German tribes, as the Cherusci, Chatti, Gamabrivi, Chattuarii, and next the ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi, Bructeri, Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci, Campsiani\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.3 7.1.3]</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern linguistic reconstructions, the classical ethnographers were not helpful in distinguishing two large groups that spoke types of Germanic very different from the Suebians and their neighbours, whose languages are the source of modern [[West Germanic]].\n*The Germanic peoples of the far north, in Scandinavia, were treated as Suebians by Tacitus, though their Germanic dialects would evolve into [[Proto Norse]], and later [[Old Norse]], as spoken by the [[Vikings]], and then the North Germanic language family of today.\n*The \"Gothic peoples\" who later formed large nations in the area that is today Ukraine, were not known to Tacitus, Pliny or Strabo, but their [[East Germanic]] languages are presumed to derive from languages spoken by Pliny's Vandal group (corresponding in part to the group made up of Gothones, Lemovii and Rugii described by Tacitus, who lived near the Baltic sea), and possibly also the Bastarnae.\nThe \"Gothic peoples\" in the territory of present-day Ukraine and Romania were seen by Graeco-Roman writers as culturally \"Scythian\", and not Germanic, and indeed some of them such as the Alans were clearly not Germanic-speaking either. Whether the Gothic-speaking groups among them had any consciousness of their connections to other Germanic-speaking peoples is a subject of dispute between scholars.\n\n==History==\n=== Earliest attestations ===\n\n==== Possible earliest contacts with the classical world (4th\u20133rd centuries BCE) ====\n{{Further|Pytheas|Bastarnae|Scirii}}\nBefore Julius Caesar, Romans and Greeks had very little contact with northern Europe itself.

As mentioned above, Caesar had this written up in a way which introduced the term \"Germanic\" to refer to peoples such as the Cimbri and Suebi.\n*63 BCE Ariovistus, described by Caesar as Germanic, led mixed forces over the Rhine into Gaul as an ally of the [[Sequani]] and [[Averni]] in their battle against the [[Aedui]], who they defeated at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]]. He stayed there on the west of the Rhine. He was also accepted as an ally by the Roman senate.\n*58 BCE. Caesar, as governor of Gaul, took the side of the [[Aedui]] against Ariovistus and his allies. He reported that Ariovistus had already settled 120,000 of his people, was demanding land for 24,000 [[Harudes]] who subsequently defeated the Aedui, and had 100 clans of Suebi coming into Gaul. Caesar defeated Ariovistus at the [[Battle of Vosges (58 BC)]].\n::Caesar listed people who fought for Ariovistus as the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Tribocci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]], [[Sedusii]], and \"Suevi\".<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.51 1.51]</ref>\n*55-53 BCE. Controversially, Caesar moved his attention to Northern Gaul. In 55 BCE he made a show of strength on the Lower Rhine, crossing it with a quickly made bridge, and then massacring a large migrating group of [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] who crossed the Rhine from the east. In the winter of 54/53 the [[Eburones]], the largest group of ''[[Germani cisrhenani]]'', revolted against the Romans and then dispersed into forests and swamps.\n::Caesar listed some ''Germani cisrhenani'' peoples: Eburones, [[Condrusi]], [[Caeraesi]], [[Paemani]] and [[Segni]]. He believed they were related to tribes on the east bank such as [[Sigambri]] and [[Ubii]]. He believed the Suevi were pressing such tribes over the Rhine from further east.\nStill in the 1st century BCE the term ''Germani'' was already used by Strabo (see above) and [[Cicero]] in ways clearly influenced by Caesar.<ref>Cicero, ''Against Piso'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi027.perseus-lat1:33 33].</ref> Of the tribes encountered by Caesar, the Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes and Ubii were all found later, on the east of the Rhine, along the new frontier of the Roman empire.\n\n====Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BCE\u201468 CE) and the Year of Four Emperors (69 CE)====\n{{Further|Roman Iron Age|Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|Year of the Four Emperors}}\n[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Roman sculpture of a young man sometimes identified as [[Arminius]]]]\nDuring the reign of [[Augustus]] from 27 BCE until 14 CE, the Roman empire became established in Gaul, with the Rhine as a border. This empire made costly campaigns to pacify and control the large region between the Rhine and Elbe. In the reign of his successor [[Tiberius]] it became a policy to leave the border at the Rhine, and expand the empire no further in that direction. The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], the extended family of Augustus, played close personal attention to management of this Germanic frontier, establishing a tradition followed by many future emperors. Major campaigns were led from the Rhine personally by [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], step-son of Augustus, then by his brother the future emperor Tiberius; next by the son of Drusus, [[Germanicus]] (father of the future emperor [[Caligula]] and grandfather of [[Nero]]).\n\nIn 38 BCE, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], consul of Transalpine Gaul, became the second Roman to lead forces over the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#49 48.49].</ref> In 31 BCE [[Gaius Carrinas (consul 43 BC)|Gaius Carrinas]] repulsed an attack by Suebi from east of the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#21 51.21].</ref> In 25 BCE [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinicius]] took vengeance on some ''Germani'' in ''Germania'', who had killed Roman traders.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#26 53.26].</ref> In 17/16 BCE at the [[Battle of Bibracte]] the [[Sugambri]], [[Usipetes]], and [[Tencteri]] crossed the Rhine and defeated the 5th legion under [[Marcus Lollius]], capturing the legion's eagle.\n\nFrom 13 BCE until 17 CE there were major Roman campaigns across the Rhine nearly every year, often led by the family of Augustus. First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and [[Frisians]] near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the [[Chauci]], [[Cherusci]], [[Chatti]] and [[Suevi]] (including the [[Marcomanni]]). These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of ''Germania''. However, within this period two Germanic kings formed large anti-Roman alliances. Both of them, ironically, had spent some of their youth in Rome:\n*After 9 BCE, [[Maroboduus]] of the Marcomanni, had led his people away from the Roman activities into the [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] area, defended by forests and mountains, and formed alliances with other peoples. He was referred to as a king of the Suevians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-eng1:2.26 2.26].</ref> In 6 CE Rome planned an attack but forces were needed for the [[Bellum Batonianum|Illyrian revolt]] in the Balkans, until 9 CE, at which time another problem arose in the north...\n*In 9 CE, [[Arminius]] of the Cherusci, initially an ally of Rome, drew the a large unsuspecting Roman force into a trap in northern Germany, and defeated [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Tiberius and Germanicus spent the next few years recovering their dominance of northern Germany. They made Maroboduus an ally, and he did not assist Arminius.\n*17-18 CE, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, with indecisive results.\n*19 CE, Marobduus was deposed by a rival claimant, perhaps supported by the Romans, and fled to Italy. He died in 37 CE. Germanicus also died, in [[Antioch]].\n*21 CE. Arminius died, murdered by opponents within his own tribe.\n\nStrabo, writing in this period in Greek, mentioned that apart from the area near the Rhine itself, the areas to the east were now inhabited by the Suevi, \"who are also named Germans, but are superior both in power and number to the others, whom they drove out, and who have now taken refuge on this side the Rhine\". Various peoples had fallen \"prey to the flames of war\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:4.3.4 4.3.4].</ref>\n\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty also recruited northern Germanic warriors, particularly men of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], as personal bodyguards to the Roman emperor, forming the so-called [[Numerus Batavorum]].

A smaller group of [[Lombards]] also breached the border together with a group called the Obii, and they were defeated.\nOther peoples, perhaps not all Germanic, involved in various actions included the [[Costoboci]], the [[Hasdingi]] and [[Lacringi]] Vandals, the [[Varisci|Varisci (or Naristi)]] and the [[Cotini]] (not Germanic according to Tacitus), and possibly also the [[Buri tribe|Buri]].\n\nAfter these Marcomannic wars, the Middle Danube began to change, and in the next century the peoples living there tended to be referred to as Gothic, rather than Germanic.\n\n==== New names on the frontiers (170\u2013370) ====\n{{Further|Crisis of the Third Century}}\nBy the early 3rd century AD, large new groupings of Germanic people appeared near the Roman frontier, though not strongly unified. The first of these conglomerations mentioned in the historical sources were the [[Alamanni]] (a term meaning \"all men\") who appear in Roman texts sometime in the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=109}} These are believed to have been a mixture of mainly Suebian peoples, who coalesced in the [[Agri Decumates]]. Emperor [[Severus Alexander]] was killed by his own soldiers in 235 CE for paying for peace with the Alamanni and the anti-aristocratic general [[Maximinus Thrax]] was elected to be emperor by the Pannonian army.{{sfn|Southern|2001|p=63}} According to the notoriously unreliable [[Augustan History]] (''Historia Augusta''), he was born in [[Thrace]] or [[Moesia]] to a [[Goths|Goth]]ic father and an [[Alans|Alan]]ic mother,<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"Life of Maximinus\", 1.5.</ref>\n\nSecondly, soon after the appearance of the Alamanni, on the [[Upper Rhine]], the [[Franks]] begin to be mentioned on the bend of the lower Rhine. In this case, the collective name was new, but the original tribes who composed the group were largely local, and their old names were still sometimes mentioned. The Franks were referred to still sometimes as ''Germani''.\n\n[[File:Gothic raids in the 3rd century.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|[[Goths|Gothic]] invasions of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 3rd century]]\nThirdly, the Goths and other \"Gothic peoples\" from the area of today's Poland and Ukraine, many of whom were Germanic speaking peoples, began to appear in records of this period.\n*In 238, Goths crossed the Danube and invaded [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]].

However, the ability to handle the barbarians in the old way broke down in the late 4th century and the western part of the empire itself broke down. In addition to the Franks on the Rhine frontier, and Suevian peoples such as the Alamanni, the eastern Germanic-speaking \"Gothic peoples\" now played an increasing role both inside and outside imperial territory.\n====Gothic entry into the empire====\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Gothic wars of the late 4th century, were in some ways similar to the biggest border conflicts of the past, but saw the defeat of a major Roman army and killing of emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianopolis]] (378). While the eastern empire eventually recovered, the subsequent long reigning western emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (reigned 393-423) was unable to impose imperial authority over much of the empire, for most of his reign.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=234-237}}</ref> In contrast to the eastern empire, in the west the \"attempts of its ruling class to use the Roman-barbarian kings to preserve the [[res publica]] failed\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=103}}\n\nThe Gothic wars were affected indirectly by the arrival of the nomadic [[Huns]] from Central Asia into the Ukrainian region. Some Gothic peoples, such as the [[Gepids]] and the [[Greuthungi]] (sometimes seen as predecessors of the later [[Ostrogoths]]), joined the newly forming Hunnish faction, and played a prominent role in the Hunnic Empire, where Gothic became a [[lingua franca]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=142}} Based on the description of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], Guy Halsall has argued that the Hunnish hegemony developed after a major campaign by Valens against the Goths, which had caused great damage, but failed to achieve a decisive victory.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=173}} Peter Heather has argued that Socrates should be rejected on this point, as inconsistent with the testimony of [[Ammianus]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=160}}\n\nIn contrast, the Gothic [[Thervingi]] had borne the impact of the campaign of Valens, under the leadership of [[Athanaric]], and were losers against the Huns, but clients of Rome. A new faction under leadership of [[Fritigern]], a christian, were given asylum inside the Roman Empire in 376 CE. They crossed the Danube and became ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=594}} With the emperor occupied in the Middle East, the Tervingi were treated badly, becoming desperate, and significant numbers of mounted Greuthungi, [[Alans]] and others were able to cross the river and support a Tervingian uprising leading to the massive Roman defeat at Adrianople.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=176-178}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|pp=79-87}}.</ref>\n\nAround 383, the Romans and the Goths now within the empire came to agreements about the terms under which the Goths should live. There is debate about the exact nature of such agreements, and for example whether it allowed the continuous semi-independent existence of pre-existing peoples, however the Goths do appear to have been allowed more privileges than traditional settlements with such outside groups.<ref>Contrast {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=180-185}} and {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=189-196}}.</ref> One result of the large settlement was that the imperial army now had a large number of Goths, including Gothic generals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=183-185}}; {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=194}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=110}}.</ref>\n\n====Imperial turmoil====\nBy 383 a new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], was seen as victorious over the Goths and having the situation back under control. Goths were a prominent but resented part of the eastern military. The Greutungi and Alans had been settled in [[Pannonia]] by the western co-emperor [[Gratian]] (assassinated in 383) who was himself a Pannonian. Theodosius died 395, and was succeeded by his sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east, and Honorius, who was still a minor, in the west. The Western empire had however become destabilized since 383, with several young emperors including Gratian having previously been murdered. Court factions and military leaders in the east and west attempted to control the situation.\n\n[[Alaric I|Alaric]] was a Roman military commander of Gothic background, who first appears in the record in the time of Theodosius. He became one of the various Roman competitors for influence and power in the difficult situation. The forces he led were described as mixed barbarian forces, and clearly included many other people of Gothic background, which had become common in the eastern empire. In an important turning point for Roman history, during the factional turmoil, his army came to act increasingly as an independent political entity within the Roman empire, and he eventually came to be referred to as their king, probably around 401 CE, when he lost his official Roman title.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=206,217}} This is the origin of the [[Visigoths]], who the empire later allowed to settle in what is now southwestern France. While military units had often had their own ethnic history and symbolism, this is the first time that such a group became a new kingdom. There is disagreement about whether Alaric or his family had a royal background, but there is no doubt that this kingdom was a new entity, very different from any previous Gothic kingdoms.\n\n====Invasions of 401\u2013411====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Rhine|Radagaisus}}\nIn the aftermath of the large scale Gothic entries into the empire, the Germanic Rhine groups, the Franks and Alemanni, became more secure in their positions in 395, when [[Stilicho]] made agreements with them so that he could withdraw the imperial forces from their Rhine frontier in order to use them in his conflicts with Alaric and the Eastern empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=199}}\n\nOn the Danube, change was far more dramatic. In the words of Walter Goffart:\n:Between 401 and 411, four distinct groups of barbarians - different from Alaric's Goths - invaded Roman territory, all apparently on one-way journeys, in large-scale efforts to transpose themselves onto imperial soil and not just plunder and return home.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=94}}\n\nThe reasons that these invasions apparently all dispersed from the same area, the Middle Danube, are uncertain. It is most often argued that the Huns must have already started moving west, and pressuring the Middle Danube. Peter Heather for example writes that around 400, \"a highly explosive situation was building up in the Middle Danube, as Goths, Vandals, Alans and other refugees from the Huns moved west of the Carpathians\" into the area of modern Hungary on the Roman frontier.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=182-183,197}}\n\nWalter Goffart, in contrast, has pointed out that there is no clear evidence of new eastern groups arriving in the area immediately before the great movements, and so it remains possible that the Huns moved West after these large groups had left the Middle Danube. Goffart's suggestion is that the example of the Goths, such as those led by Alaric, had set an example leading to a \"common perception that warriors could improve their condition by forcing their existence on the attention of the Empire\".{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=ch.5}}\n\nWhatever the chain of events, the Middle Danube later became the centre of Attila's loose empire containing many East Germanic people from the east, who remained there after the death of Attila. The make-up of peoples in that area, previously the home of the Germanic Marcomanni, Quadi and non-Germanic Iazyges, changed completely in ways which had a significant impact on the Roman empire and its European neighbours. In the future, though the new peoples ruling this area still included Germanic-speakers, as discussed above, they were not described by Romans as ''Germani'', but rather \"Gothic peoples\".\n\n*In 401, [[Claudian]] mentions a Roman victory over a large force including Vandals, in the province of Ra\u00ebtia. It is possible that this group was involved in the later crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=88-89}}\n*In 405-406, [[Radagaisus]] who was probably Gothic, entered the empire on the Middle Danube with a very large force of unclearly defined, but apparently Gothic, composition, and succeeded to invade Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=182}} He was captured and killed in 406 near Florence and 12000 of his men recruited into Roman forces.\n*A more successful invasion apparently also originating from the Middle Danube, reached the Rhine a few months later. As described by Halsall: \"On 31 December 405 a huge body from the interior of Germania crossed the Rhine: Siling and Hasding Vandals, Sueves and Alans. [...] The Franks in the area fought back furiously and even killed the Vandal king. Significantly no source mentions any defense by Roman troops.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=211}} The composition of this group of barbarians, who were not all Germanic-speaking, indicates that they had traveled from the area north of the [[Middle Danube]]. (The Suebians involved may well have included remnants of the once powerful Marcomanni and Quadi.) The non-Germanic Alans were the largest group, and one part of them under [[King Goar]] settled with Roman agreement in Gaul, while the rest of these peoples entered Roman Iberia in 409 and established kingdoms there, and some traveled further to establish the Vandal kingdom of North Africa.\n*In 411 a Burgundian group established themselves in northern [[Germania Superior]] on the Rhine, between Franks and Alamanni, holding the cities of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. They and a group of Alans helped establish yet another short-lived claimant to the throne, [[Jovinus]], who was eventually defeated by the Visigoths cooperating with Honorius.\n\nMotivated by the ensuing chaos in Gaul, in 406 the Roman army in Britain elected [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine \"III\"]] as emperor and they took control there.\n\nIn 408, the eastern emperor Arcadius died, leaving a child as successor, and the west Roman military leader [[Stilicho]] was killed. Alaric, wanting a formal Roman command but unable to negotiate one, invaded Rome itself, twice, in 401 and 408.\n\n[[Constantius III]], who became ''[[Magister militum]]'' by 411, restored order step-by-step, eventually allowing the Visigoths to settle within the empire in southwest Gaul. He also committed to re-taking control of Iberia, from the Rhine-crossing groups. When Constantius died in 421, having been co-emperor himself for one year, Honorius was the only emperor in the West. However, Honorius died in 423 without heir. After this, the Western Roman empire steadily lost control of its provinces.\n\n==== From Western Roman Empire to medieval kingdoms (420\u2013568) ====\n{{Further|Decline of the Western Roman Empire|Barbarian kingdoms}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Germania|Germanic]] kingdoms and tribes after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE]]\n[[File:Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Coin of [[Odoacer]], Ravenna, 477, with Odoacer in profile, depicted with a \"barbarian\" [[moustache]].]]\n[[File:Germanic kingdoms 526CE.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Germanic kingdoms in 526 CE]]\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|2nd century to 6th century simplified migrations]]\nThe Western Roman Empire declined over several steps in the 5th and 6th centuries, and the eastern emperors only had limited control over events in Italy and the western empire. Germanic speakers who by now dominated the Roman military in Europe, and lived both inside and outside the empire, played many roles in this complex dynamic. Notably, as the old territory of the western empire came to be ruled on a regional basis, the barbarian military forces, ruled now by kings, took over administration with differing levels of success. With some exceptions, such as the [[Alans]] and [[Bretons]], most of these new political entities identified themselves with a Germanic-speaking heritage.\n\nIn the 420s, [[Flavius A\u00ebtius]] was a general who successfully used Hunnish forces on several occasions, fighting Roman factions, and various barbarians including Goths and Franks. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of ''magister militum'' in the western empire, putting him in control of much of its policy. One of his first conflicts was with [[Bonifacius|Boniface]], a rebellious governor of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in modern Tunisia and Libya. Both sides sought an alliance with the Vandals based in southern Spain who had acquired a fleet there. In this context, the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal and Alan kingdom]] of North Africa and the western Mediterranean would come into being.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=240}}\n*In 433 A\u00ebtius was in exile and spent time in the Hunnish domain.\n*In 434, the Vandals were granted the control of some parts of northwest Africa, but A\u00ebtius defeated Boniface using Hunnish forces.\n*In 436 A\u00ebtius defeated the Burgundians on the Rhine with the help of Hunnish forces.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=244}}\n*In 439 the Vandals and their allies captured Carthage. The Romans made a new agreement recognizing the Visigothic kingdom.\n*In 440, the Hunnish \"empire\" as it can now be called, under [[Attila]] and his brother Bleda began a series of attacks over the Danube into the eastern empire, and Danubian part of the western empire. They received enormous payments from the eastern empire and then focused their attentions to the west, where they were already familiar with the situation, and in friendly contact with the African Vandals.\n*In 442 A\u00ebtius seems to have granted the Alans who had remained in Gaul a kingdom, apparently including [[Orl\u00e9ans]], possibly to counter local independent Roman groups (so called [[Bagaudae]], who also competed for power in Iberia).\n*In 443 A\u00ebtius settled the Burgundians from the Rhine deeper in the empire, in Savoy in Gaul.\n*In 451, the large mixed force of Attila crossed the Rhine but was defeated by Aetius with forces from the settled barbarians in Gaul - Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians and Alans.\n*In 452 Attila attacked Italy, but had to retreat to the Middle Danube because of disease.\n*In 453, A\u00ebtius and Attila both died.\n*In 454, the Hunnish alliance divided and fought the [[Battle of Nedao]]. The original names of the peoples in the alliance appear again. Several of them were allowed to become federates of the eastern empire in the Balkans, and others created kingdoms in the Middle Danube.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Franks and Alamanni tended to remain in small kingdoms but these began to extend deeper into the empire. In northern Gaul, a Roman military \"King of Franks\" also seems to have existed, [[Childeric I]], whose successor [[Clovis I]] established dominance of the smaller kingdoms of the Franks and Alamanni, who they defeated at the [[Battle of Tolbiac|Battle of Z\u00fclpich]] in 496. \n\nCompared to Gaul, what happened in [[Roman Britain]], which was similarly both isolated from Italy and heavily Romanized, is less clearly recorded. However the end result was similar, with a Germanic-speaking military class, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], taking over administration of what remained of Roman society, and conflict between an unknown number of regional powers. While major parts of Gaul and Britain redefined themselves ethnically on the basis of their new rulers, as [[West Francia|Francia]] and [[England]], in England the main population also became Germanic speaking. The exact reasons for the difference are uncertain, but significant levels of migration played a role.{{sfn|Halsall|2013}}\n\nIn 476 [[Odoacer]], a Roman soldier who came from the tribes of the Middle Danube in the aftermath of Nedao, became King of Italy, removing the last western emperors from power. He was murdered and replaced in 493 by [[Theoderic the Great]], described as [[King of the Ostrogoths]], one of the most powerful Middle Danube peoples of the old Hun alliance. Theoderic had been raised up and supported by the eastern emperors, and his administration continued a sophisticated Roman administration, in cooperation with the traditional [[Roman senate|Roman senatorial]] class. Similarly, Roman lifestyles continued in North Africa under the Vandals, Savoy under the Burgundians, and within the Visigothic realm.\n\nThe Ostrogothic kingdom ended in 542 when the eastern emperor [[Justinian]] made a last great effort to reconquer the [[Western Mediterranean]]. The conflicts destroyed the Italian senatorial class.{{sfn|Geary|2002|p=113}} The eastern empire was also unable to hold Italy for long, and in 568 the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]], a Suebian people who had entered the Middle Danubian region from the north conquering and partly absorbing the frontier peoples there, entered Italy and created the Italian [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] there. These Lombards now included Suevi, [[Heruli]], [[Gepids]], [[Bavarians]], Bulgars, Avars, Saxons, Goths, and [[Thuringians]]. As Peter Heather has written these \"peoples\" were no longer peoples in any traditional sense.<ref>{{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=240}}, citing [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref>\n\nOlder accounts which describe a long period of massive movements of peoples and military invasions are over-simplified, and only describe specific incidents. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the Germanic peoples did not and could not \"conquer the more advanced Roman world\" nor were they able to \"restore it as a political and economic entity\"; instead, he asserts that the empire's \"universalism\" was replaced by \"tribal particularism\" which gave way to \"regional patriotism\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=308}} The Germanic peoples who overran the Western Roman Empire probably numbered less than 100,000 people per tribe, including approximately 15,000-20,000 warriors. They constituted a tiny minority of the population in the lands over which they seized control.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=7}}: \"[T]hese tribes were surprisingly small: fifteen to twenty thousand warriors\u2014which means a total of about one hundred thousand people in a tribe\u2014was the maximum number a large people could raise... These people are likewise presented as conquerors of the Roman Empire, even though they constituted a vanishing minority within it.\"}}\n\nApart from the common history many of them had in the Roman military, and on Roman frontiers, a new and longer-term unifying factor for the new kingdoms was that by 500, the start of the [[Middle Ages]], most of the old Western empire had converted to the same Rome-based [[Catholicism|Catholic]] form of [[Christianity]]. A key turning point was the conversion of Clovis I in 508. Before this point, many of the Germanic kingdoms, such as the Goths and Burgundians, were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians - a form of Christianity which they perhaps took up in the time of the Arian emperor [[Valens]], but which was now considered a heresy.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Early Middle Ages}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Frankish expansion from the early kingdom of [[Clovis I]] (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870)]]\n[[File:Viking Expansion.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map showing area of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements during the [[Viking Age]], including [[Normans|Norman]] conquests]]\nIn the centuries after 568, the [[Visigothic kingdom]], by now centred in Spain, was ended by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the 8th century. Much of continental catholic Europe became part of a greater [[Francia]] under the [[Merovingian]] and then the [[Carolingian dynasty]], which began with [[Pepin the Short]], the son of [[Charles Martel]]. Charles, though not a king, reconsolidated the Frankish kingdom's dominance over Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians and Burgundians, and defeated the Umayyads at the 732 [[Battle of Tours]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] conquered the Lombards in 774, and in an important turning point in European history, was crowned as emperor by [[Pope Leo III]] in Rome on Christmas Day, 800 CE. This consolidated a shift in the power structure from the south to the north, and was also a strong symbolic link to Rome and the Roman Christianity. The core of the new empire included what is now France, Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries. The empire laid the foundations for the medieval and early modern ''[[ancien regime]]'', finally destroyed only by the [[French Revolution]]. The Frankish-Catholic way of doing politics and war and religion also had a strong effect upon all neighbouring regions, including what became England, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Bohemia.\n\nThe effect of old Germanic culture on this new Latin-using empire is a topic of dispute, because there was much continuity with the old Roman legal systems, and the increasingly important Christian religion. An example which is argued to show an influence of earlier Germanic culture is law. The new kingdoms created new law codes in Latin, with occasional Germanic words.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}} These were Roman-influenced, and under strong church influence all law was increasingly standardized to accord with Christian philosophy, and old Roman law.{{sfn|Geary|2002|pp=123-128,137-138}}\n\nGermanic languages in western Europe also faded out of use in most areas apart from the West Germanic group of related languages including England, the \"[[Austrasia]]n\" Frankish homelands near the Lower Rhine, Maas and Scheldt rivers, and the large area between the Rhine and Elbe. With the splitting off of this latter area within the Frankish empire, the first ever political entity corresponding loosely to modern \"Germany\" came into existence.\n\nIn [[Eastern Europe]] the once relatively developed periphery of the Roman world collapsed culturally and economically, and this can be seen in the Germanic-associated archaeological evidence: in the area of today's southern Poland and Ukraine the collapse was not long after 400, and by 700 Germanic material culture was entirely west of the Elbe in the area where the Romans had been active since Caesar's time, and the Franks were now active. East of the Elbe was to become mainly [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speaking.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=371-372}}\n\nOutside of the Roman-influenced zone, Germanic-speaking Scandinavia was in the [[Vendel period]] and eventually entered the [[Viking Age]], with [[Viking expansion|expansion]] to [[Danelaw|Britain]], Ireland and [[history of Iceland|Iceland]] in the west and as far as [[Rus Khaganate|Russia]] and [[Varangians|Greece]] in the east.<ref>{{harvtxt|Derry|2012|pp=16\u201335}}; {{harvtxt|Clements|2005|pp=214\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=310}}</ref> Swedish Vikings, known locally as the [[Rus' people|Rus']], ventured deep into Russia, where they founded the political entities of [[Kievan Rus']].

Bit by bit they became Christian, and organized themselves into Frankish- and Catholic-influenced kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire 11th century map-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Kingdom of Germany]] (''Regnum Teutonicum'') within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], circa 1000 AD]]\n\n==Roman descriptions of early Germanic people and culture==\n{{See|Germanic culture|Early Germanic culture}}\nCaesar and Tacitus gave colorful descriptions of the Germanic peoples, but scholars note that these need to be viewed cautiously. For one thing, many of the tropes used, such as concerning the red or blond hair, the blue eyes, and the undisciplined emotions of the Germanic peoples, were old ones that had long been used for any northern peoples such as Gauls. Secondly, the Germanic descriptions of both authors are recognized as having been intended to be both critical of Roman moral softness, and pushing for specific foreign policies.\n\nTacitus famously described the Germanic people as ethnically \"unmixed\", which had an influence on pre-1945 German racist nationalism. It was not necessarily meant to be purely positive:\n:For my own part, I agree with those who think that the tribes of Germany are free from all taint of inter-marriages with foreign nations, and that they appear as a distinct, unmixed race, like none but themselves. Hence, too, the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population. All have fierce blue eyes, red hair, huge frames, fit only for a sudden exertion. They are less able to bear laborious work. Heat and thirst they cannot in the least endure; to cold and hunger their climate and their soil inure them.<ref name=tac4>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:4 4].</ref>\n\nModern scholars point out that one way of interpreting such remarks is that it is consistent with other comments by Tacitus indicating that the Germanic people lived very remotely, in unattractive countries, for example in the next part of the text:\n:Their country, though somewhat various in appearance, yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps; it is more rainy on the side of Gaul, bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia. It is productive of grain, but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees; it is rich in flocks and herds, but these are for the most part undersized, and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head. <ref name=tac5>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:5 5].</ref>\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the early Germanic peoples were primarily agricultural, although husbandry and fishing were important sources of livelihood depending on the nature of the environment.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=166-174}} They carried out extensive trade with their neighbours, notably exporting amber, slaves, mercenaries and animal hides, and importing weapons, metals, glassware and coins in return.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=174-178}} They eventually came to excel at craftsmanship, particularly metalworking.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=23}} In many cases in fact, ancient Germanic smiths and other craftsmen produced products of higher quality than the Romans.{{Efn|\"Some smiths were able to rework iron into high-quality steel and make sword blades with a core of softer steel for flexibility and harder steel on the exterior to keep a sharp edge, far finer weapons than those used in the Roman army at the time.\"{{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=324}} \"Furthermore, the skills of Germanic smiths and other craftsmen were as good as, or better than those found inside the Roman empire.\"{{harvtxt|MacDowall|2000|p=16}} }}\n\nBefore Tacitus, Julius Caesar described the ''Germani'' and their customs in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', though in certain cases it is still a matter of debate if he refers to Northern [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes or clearly identified Germanic tribes. Caesar notes that the Gauls had earlier dominated and sent colonies into the lands of the Germans, but that the Gauls had since degenerated under the influence of Roman civilization, and now considered themselves inferior in military prowess.{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=156, 6.24}}: \"Proximity to our provinces and familiarity with seaborne imports bring the Gauls many things to use and keep, so they gradually grew accustomed to defeat, losing many battles and not even claiming to be the Germans' equals in courage now.\" {{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=29, 1.39}}: \"[O]ur men inquired and heard Gauls and merchants describing the Germans' huge bodies, their incredible strength, and their experience in arms. They had often encountered them and could not stand the sight of them or endure their gaze. Great fear suddenly seized our whole army...\".}}\n\n:[The Germani] have neither [[Druids]] to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained [[chaste]] for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only] use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body being in consequence naked.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.21 6.21].</ref>\n\n:They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere.<ref>{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=153\u2013154}}, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.22 6.22].</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Percentage of major Y-DNA haplogroups in Europe.png|thumb|275px|Percentage of major [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups in Europe; [[Haplogroup I1]] represented by light blue.]]\nIn a 2013 book which reviewed studies up until then it was remarked that: \"If and when scientists find ancient [[Y-DNA]] from men whom we can guess spoke Proto-Germanic, it is most likely to be a mixture of [[haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup I1]], [[Haplogroup R1a#R-Z282_(R1a1a1b1a)_(Eastern_Europe)|R1a1a]], [[Haplogroup R-M269#R-P312|R1b-P312]] and [[Haplogroup R-M269#R1b1a1a2a1a1_(R-U106)|R1b-106]]\". This was based purely upon those being the Y-DNA groups judged to be most commonly shared by speakers of Germanic languages today. However, as remarked in that book: \"All of these are far older than Germanic languages and some are common among speakers of other languages too.\"{{sfn|Manco|2013|p=208}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category multi|Germanic peoples|Ancient Germanic history and culture}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Teutonic Peoples|Germanic peoples}}\n* [[List of Germanic peoples]]\n* [[Early Germanic culture]]\n* [[Nordic race]]\n* [[Slavs]]\n* [[Balts]]\n* [[Thracians]]\n* [[Illyrians]]\n* [[Italic peoples]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Boatwright|first1=Mary T.|last2=Gargola|first2=Daniel J.|last3=Talbert|first3=Richard J.
