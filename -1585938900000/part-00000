Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.\n* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. \n* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of [[electronic media]], however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.\"\n* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint /><ref name=EB /><ref name=DOLei /><ref name=OHEL22 /> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint />\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite book|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiae'', 1669 edition, title page]]\nOne of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77\u201379, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early [[Middle Ages]], is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Age]] was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4&nbsp;million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref> The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into [[French language|French]], Proven\u00e7al, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[Flemish]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' \u2013 they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Tr\u00e9sor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, \"Medieval Encyclopaedias\", in Andr\u00e9 Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]\nMedieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name=\"dotma\">See \"Encyclopedia\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].\n\nThe term ''encyclopaedia'' was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138%3Abook%3Dpreface%3Achapter%3D3 Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', Preface 14].</ref> and [[Quintilian]],<ref>Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd vocant.''</ref> and combined the two Greek words \"''enkyklios paedia''\" into one word, \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: \"f. l.

Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger \u2026 and Smaller|journal=Information & Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233\u2013254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional encyclopedias===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', 1773]]\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''. As many as 90% were sold [[door to door]]. Jack Lynch says in his book ''You Could Look It Up'' that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, ''\u201cThey were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\"''  A 1961 ''World Book'' ad said, ''\u201cYou are holding your family\u2019s future in your hands right now,\u201d'' while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=How Two Artists Turn Old Encyclopedias Into Beautiful, Melancholy Art |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/how-two-artists-turn-old-encyclopedias-into-beautiful-melancholy-art.html |website=Slate |accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].\n\n=== Rise of digital and online encyclopedias ===\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027213618/http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nDigital technologies and online [[crowdsourcing]] allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. [[Wikipedia]], a crowd-sourced, [[List of Wikipedia language editions|multilingual]], [[Open content|open licence]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[open source]] [[MediaWiki]] software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by [[Wikipedians|volunteer editors]], organized by [[Voting|collaboratively agreed]] guidelines and [[Wikipedia community|user-roles]].

Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.\n* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. \n* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of [[electronic media]], however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.\"\n* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint /><ref name=EB /><ref name=DOLei /><ref name=OHEL22 /> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint />\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite book|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiae'', 1669 edition, title page]]\nOne of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77\u201379, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early [[Middle Ages]], is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Age]] was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref> The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into [[French language|French]], Proven\u00e7al, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[Flemish]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' \u2013 they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Tr\u00e9sor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, \"Medieval Encyclopaedias\", in Andr\u00e9 Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]\nMedieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name=\"dotma\">See \"Encyclopedia\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].\n\nThe term ''encyclopaedia'' was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138%3Abook%3Dpreface%3Achapter%3D3 Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', Preface 14].</ref> and [[Quintilian]],<ref>Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd vocant.''</ref> and combined the two Greek words \"''enkyklios paedia''\" into one word, \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: \"f. l.

Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger \u2026 and Smaller|journal=Information & Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233\u2013254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional encyclopedias===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', 1773]]\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''. As many as 90% were sold [[door to door]]. Jack Lynch says in his book ''You Could Look It Up'' that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, ''\u201cThey were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\"''  A 1961 ''World Book'' ad said, ''\u201cYou are holding your family\u2019s future in your hands right now,\u201d'' while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=How Two Artists Turn Old Encyclopedias Into Beautiful, Melancholy Art |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/how-two-artists-turn-old-encyclopedias-into-beautiful-melancholy-art.html |website=Slate |accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].\n\n=== Rise of digital and online encyclopedias ===\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027213618/http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nDigital technologies and online [[crowdsourcing]] allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. [[Wikipedia]], a crowd-sourced, [[List of Wikipedia language editions|multilingual]], [[Open content|open licence]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[open source]] [[MediaWiki]] software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by [[Wikipedians|volunteer editors]], organized by [[Voting|collaboratively agreed]] guidelines and [[Wikipedia community|user-roles]].

{"title_page": "The impact of geography on colonial America", "text_new": "{{essay|date=September 2016}}\n\nBefore the foundation of the [[United States]] in 1776, [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] owned [[Thirteen Colonies]] on the eastern shore of [[North America]]. The geography and climate of the area had a significant impact on the economy and survival of the colonies.\n\n==New England Colonies / Northern Colonies==\n\nThe New England colonies tried to help the Native Americans and also, known as the North-Eastern, included Massachusetts Colony, Rhode Island Colony, Connecticut Colony, and New Hampshire Colony. The region was taken from indigenous people by the people from Britain in 1620 after they had lived there for generations. The British-Americans also committed genocide on the people already living there.\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|British colonies]]\nThese colonies provided fish, whale products, and [[lumber]].\n\n=== Geography ===\nThe [[Geology of North America]] includes many mountains, and it is thick with trees and rivers. The forest provided large amounts of lumber for New England and led them to specialize in the [[shipbuilding]] industry. However, the landscape was unsuitable for cereal crops, so they were imported from the other colonies.<ref>New England Colonies. (2007). Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://matsumoto.eesd.org/tm28/col09/colne.html</ref> Originally this region had fertile soil, but during the [[last glacial period]], large glaciers scraped it away.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe New England region is located further north and it has longer winters and the coldest weather among all of the three regions. Summer is mild and short.  The growing season is short.\n\n=== People ===\nWhen [[English people]] made the Northern colonies they named their region \"[[New England]]\" for their homeland. Famous people from the region included [[John Winthrop]] from Massachusetts, [[Roger Williams]] and [[Anne Hutchinson]] from Rhode Island, [[Thomas Hooker]] from Connecticut, and [[John Mason (governor)|John Mason]] from New Hampshire.<ref>Alchin, L. (2014, June). New England Colonies. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://www.landofthebrave.info/new-england-colonies.htm</ref> Residents in the northern region were mostly [[Puritans]]. That was the only religion throughout the New England Colonies because the Puritans wanted it that way. There was no religious freedom in the region.<ref>Alchin, L. (2014, June). Puritans. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://www.landofthebrave.info/puritans.htm</ref>\n\n===Trade goods===\nSince the soil and weather in New England were not suitable for farming, many people did not farm. Instead, they imported crops from other regions or even other countries. In return, they would trade products they had to other countries. These products included fish, whale products, ships, timber products. Also, they traded furs and livestock products made from animals living in the surrounding forests.\n\nUsing the large numbers of trees in the forest, people from New England worked at [[shipbuilding]]. People in New England cut down trees for lumber to build ships. They would then use them for fishing and hunting whales. That is also a factor that affected what goods people in New England would trade. There was much trade between New England and other regions or countries such as England. New England would export resources like fish and lumber to [[Africa]], [[England]], and the [[West Indies]]. Then from Africa, New England would receive hardworking slaves in return.<ref>New England Colonies. (2007).

Their climate helped them become the 'breadbasket' of [[British North America]]. [[Arable land]] was plentiful and the soil was fertile. The excellent natural harbors helped the middle colonies become traders among the colonies. Due in part to immigration from foreign ([[Mainland Europe]]) countries, the people were ethnically and religiously diverse.\n\n=== Geography ===\nThese colonies included [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Delaware]]. New York is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. Manhattan Island is a well-known location of New York, originally called New Amsterdam. [[Lake Erie]] is the great lake that New York shares a border with. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] run through the middle of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is bordered by New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. This region also shares a border with Lake Erie. Many rivers run through the state including the Ohio and Delaware Rivers. On the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, Delaware is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Delaware Bay]], as well as by the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland.<ref>Delaware Geography. (n.d.). Retrieved December 2014, from Delaware.gob: http://www.delaware.gov/topics/facts/geo.shtml</ref> The area of Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York is known as the Highlands. The [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] is a region along the middle colonies primarily composed of marsh, rivers, and swampland.\n\n=== Climate ===\nSince the colonies were further south, the days were longer with a lot of sunlight and plenty of rain. The climate in the coastal region of the middle colonies is moderate year round. Average monthly temperatures range from 76 to 32 degrees. The average temperature in the summer months is 74 degrees. About 57% of the days are sunny. Annual precipitation is approximately 45 inches. Temperatures along the Atlantic Coast are about 10 degrees warmer in winter and 10 degrees cooler in summer. The average growing season varies from 170 to 200 days.<ref>Delaware Geography. (n.d.).

(2014). Retrieved from LandScope America: http://www.landscope.org/explore/natural_geographies/ecoregions/Mid-Atlantic%20Coastal%20Plain/</ref>\n\n=== People ===\nThe middle colonies contained Native American tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquois]] language groups as well as a sizable percentage of African slaves during the early years. Unlike solidly Puritan New England, the middle colonies presented an assortment of religions. The presence of [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Lutherans]], Dutch Calvinists, and [[Presbyterians]] made the dominance of one faith next to impossible.<ref>The Middle Colonies. (2008-2014). Retrieved December 2014, from U.S. Histor-Columbian to the New Millennium: http://www.ushistory.org/us/4.asp</ref> This was because some of the [[proprietary colony|proprietors]] there believed in religious tolerance and some did not care as long the people paid for the land they inhabited.\n\nSome wealthy people worked in the city although most colonists were farmers. Because of fertile soil and a good growing season, most farmers grew enough for their family and a surplus, which they could sell. They grew wheat, grains, and many other things. New York and Philadelphia were the Middle Colonies' biggest cities. This was because they were the center of trade with all the harbors to import and export goods. Many people were artisans or merchants with many skills. Other people tried to become apprentices to learn their trade. Other people became laborers. They could find general work such as helping load or unload ships or being house servants. Boys could learn shoe or boat making. Girls could open a cloth shop. However, most parents believed children should learn to run the family farm instead of going to college.<ref>Brandon, R. T. (2001). Middle Colonies. Retrieved December 2014, from Early American Colonies: http://matsumoto.eesd.org/tm28/col09/colmc.html</ref>\n\n=== Trade goods ===\nThere were considerable differences between the New England, Middle and Southern regions. Economic activities and trade were dependent on the environment in which the colonists lived. The geography and climate impacted the trade and economic activities of Middle Colonies. The Middle Colonies exported agricultural products and natural resources. The Middle colonies are often called the breadbasket colonies because they grew so many crops, especially wheat. The Middle colonies built flour mills where wheat was ground into flour, then shipped to England. A typical farm was 50 to 150 acres consisting of a house, barn, yard, and fields.<ref>Alchin, L. (2013). Middle Colonies. Retrieved December 2014, from Land of the Brave: http://www.landofthebrave.info/middle-colonies.htm</ref> The Middle Colonies were also able to manufacture iron ore products such as plows, tools, kettles, nails and large blocks of iron which they exported to England.<ref>Alchin, L.

L. (2011). Outline of U.S. History. Washington D.C.: Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State.</ref>\n\nThe Middle Colonies were in the prime location for the growth of grains. A predominant feature of the region is the [[Coastal plain|Coastal Plain]]. This region had humid summers and temperate winters which are prime conditions for agriculture. Due to the climate of temperate summers, the grains were allowed to grow for longer periods of time. Up north, the winters were much too harsh to grow these grains. These grains were then exported to other Colonies due to its prime location to the ocean. The climate was prime for these grains which is a direct correlation to how geography relates to trade goods in the Middle Eastern Colonies.\n\n== Southern colonies ==\n[[File:Location of jamestown virginia.jpg|thumb|Location of [[Jamestown, Virginia]]]]\nThe southern British colonies in North America were the [[Colony of Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia]]. The first successful English colony in N. America was [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], established off the Chesapeake Bay in 1607. In 1668 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the Carolina charter to eight Lords Proprietor. Georgia was not established as a colony until 1732 under a charter granted to [[James Oglethorpe]] by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].\n\n=== Geography ===\nLocated between 40 degrees and 30 degrees latitude, the physiographic makeup of the southern colonies is generally divided into three regions. The Atlantic Coastal Plain (divided into two parts; the Inner Coastal Plain and the Tidewater), Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge Mountains and Appalachian mountain regions.\n\n[[Atlantic coastal plain|The Atlantic Coastal plains]] developed over the last 6,000 years, flattening out via the global flood as well as the transportation of sediment by river systems from the Appalachian Mountains.<ref>GEOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE NEW YORK BIGHT. (n.d.). Retrieved December 17, 2014, from http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/bight/coastal.html</ref> Crisscrossed by these river systems, the area became known as the Tidewater region due to the noticeable effect of the ocean's tides on the rivers that run through it.\n\nFrench for \"foothills\", the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] is characterized by rolling hills stretching between the coastal plain and the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is separated from the coastal plain by the \"fall line\", line where elevation falls noticeably and is the sight of many waterfalls on the rivers in the region.\n\nThe [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] is a specific region of the Appalachians. The ridgeline of the mountains varies from being 5 to 65 miles wide, with peaks averaging around 2000 to 4000&nbsp; ft above sea level.<ref>Blue Ridge (mountains, United States). (n.d.).

These products included fish, whale products, ships, timber products. Also, they traded furs and livestock products made from animals living in the surrounding forests.\n\nUsing the large numbers of trees in the forest, people from New England worked at [[shipbuilding]]. People in New England cut down trees for lumber to build ships. They would then use them for fishing and hunting whales. That is also a factor that affected what goods people in New England would trade. There was much trade between New England and other regions or countries such as England.

New York is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. Manhattan Island is a well-known location of New York, originally called New Amsterdam. [[Lake Erie]] is the great lake that New York shares a border with. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] run through the middle of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is bordered by New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. This region also shares a border with Lake Erie. Many rivers run through the state including the Ohio and Delaware Rivers.

The climate in the coastal region of the middle colonies is moderate year round. Average monthly temperatures range from 76 to 32 degrees. The average temperature in the summer months is 74 degrees. About 57% of the days are sunny. Annual precipitation is approximately 45 inches. Temperatures along the Atlantic Coast are about 10 degrees warmer in winter and 10 degrees cooler in summer.

Because of fertile soil and a good growing season, most farmers grew enough for their family and a surplus, which they could sell. They grew wheat, grains, and many other things. New York and Philadelphia were the Middle Colonies' biggest cities. This was because they were the center of trade with all the harbors to import and export goods. Many people were artisans or merchants with many skills. Other people tried to become apprentices to learn their trade. Other people became laborers. They could find general work such as helping load or unload ships or being house servants. Boys could learn shoe or boat making. Girls could open a cloth shop.

Economic activities and trade were dependent on the environment in which the colonists lived. The geography and climate impacted the trade and economic activities of Middle Colonies. The Middle Colonies exported agricultural products and natural resources. The Middle colonies are often called the breadbasket colonies because they grew so many crops, especially wheat.

A predominant feature of the region is the [[Coastal plain|Coastal Plain]]. This region had humid summers and temperate winters which are prime conditions for agriculture. Due to the climate of temperate summers, the grains were allowed to grow for longer periods of time. Up north, the winters were much too harsh to grow these grains. These grains were then exported to other Colonies due to its prime location to the ocean. The climate was prime for these grains which is a direct correlation to how geography relates to trade goods in the Middle Eastern Colonies.\n\n== Southern colonies ==\n[[File:Location of jamestown virginia.jpg|thumb|Location of [[Jamestown, Virginia]]]]\nThe southern British colonies in North America were the [[Colony of Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia]]. The first successful English colony in N. America was [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], established off the Chesapeake Bay in 1607.

The seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of [[Imam Shamil]]. The aristocracy was called ''warq''. Some aristocratic families held the rank of ''Pshi'' or prince and the eldest member of this family was the ''Pshi-tkhamade'' who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to ''tfokotl'', roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the ''warq''.\n\nThey were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called ''Khase'' or larger ones called ''Zafes''.\n\nDecisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the ''Pshi-tkhamade'', although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.\n\nIn addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]''. Many houses would have a ''kunakskaya'' or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to ''abreks'' or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or ''kunaks''. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called ''tleuzh'' who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an ''atalyk'' or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. ''Adyghe khabze'' is sometimes called ''[[adat]]'' when it is contrasted to the kind of [[Islamic law]] advocated by people like [[Imam Shamil]].\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n[[File:Traditional clothing, Circassian Heritage Center.JPG|thumb|Traditional Circassian clothing]]\n\nThe traditional female clothing ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0437\u044b\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0428\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Bz\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|bz\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ({{lang-ady |\u0414\u0436\u0430\u043d\u044d\u0440, Janer}} {{IPA-ady|d\u0361\u0292a\u02d0nar|}}), coat ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0435, Saye}} {{IPA-ady|sa\u02d0ja|}}), shirt, pant ({{lang-ady |\u0414\u0436\u044d\u043d\u044d\u043a\u04c0\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440, Jene\u00e7'akuer}} {{IPA-ady|d\u0361\u0292anat\u0361\u0283\u02bca\u02d0k\u02b7ar|}}), vest ({{lang-ady |\u041a\u04c0\u044d\u043a\u04c0, \u00c7'e\u00e7'}} {{IPA-ady|t\u0361\u0283\u02bcat\u0361\u0283\u02bc|}}), lamb leather bra ({{lang-ady |\u0428\u044a\u043e\u0445\u044a\u0442\u0430\u043d, \u2c7euex\u0301tan}} {{IPA-ady|\u0282\u02b7a\u03c7ta\u02d0n|}}), a variety of hats ({{lang-ady |\u041f\u044d\u04c0\u043e\u0445\u044d\u0440}, Pe\ua727uexer} {{IPA-ady|pa\u0294\u02b7axar|}}), shoes, and belts ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0433\u044b\u0440\u044b\u043f\u0445\u044b\u0445\u044d\u0440, B\u011f\u0131r\u0131px\u0131xer}} {{IPA-ady|b\u0263\u0259r\u0259px\u0259xar|}}).\n\nHoliday dresses are made of expensive fabrics such as silk and velvet. The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.\n\nThe traditional male costume ({{lang-ady |\u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044a\u0443\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0448\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Ad\u0131\u011fe X\u0301u\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|a\u02d0d\u0259\u0263a \u03c7\u02b7\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors\u2019 times wore coat with short sleeves\u2014in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn).\n\nA compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called ''[[shashka]]''. It is a special kind of [[sabre]]; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word \"Sashkhwa\" ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0448\u044c\u0445\u044a\u0443\u044d, Sas\u0328x\u0301ue}}) which means \"long knife\". On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n[[File:Old Circassian traditional house.jpg|thumb|An old country house and traditional cuisine with [[Haliva]] (\u0425\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240wa) and [[Mataz]] (\u041c\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u044d, Metaze), two of the prominent traditional Adyghe snacks.]]\n\nThe Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yHeq6UZxf8 |title=Jordanian Cuisine(Bedouins, Circassians, & Palestinians)(\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ref_ac\">{{cite web|editor=Amjad Jaimoukha|editor-link=Amjad Jaimoukha|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|title=Circassian Cuisine|publisher=Circassianworld.com|accessdate=20 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306214324/http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref> In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as ''[[ficcin]]''.\n\n[[Circassian cheese]] is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the [[North Caucasus]].\n\nA popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.\n\nVariants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.\n\nOn holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make ''[[haliva]]'' ({{lang-ady|\u0445\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240ua}}) (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies.

The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its{{clarify|date=September 2014}} colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by [[Populus|poplar]] leaves ({{lang-ady| \u0435\u043a\u04cf\u044d\u043f\u0446\u04cf\u044d, Ye\u00e7'epc'e}} {{IPA-ady|jat\u0361\u0283\u02bcapt\u0361s\u02bca|}}).\n\nThe carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.\n\nThe carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ({{lang-ady| \u0448\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0447\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, \u015exuen\u00e7\u0131mre}} {{IPA-ady|\u0283x\u02b7ant\u0361\u0283\u0259mra|}}) and pistols ({{lang-ady| \u043a\u044a\u044d\u043b\u0430\u0435\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, Qelaye\u0131mre}}), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.\n\nThe carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage][[prayer rug]].

They had slightly different dialects.\n\nDialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into princedoms (tribes) after the death of [[Inal of Kabardia]], who united Circassia for the last time before its short reunion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the princedoms became harder, each princedom became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each princedom developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their princedoms. After a longer while, the people began being called after the princedom which they live under the banner of. Therefore, there is a widespread misconception of these princedoms actually being tribes. Opposed to that, the notion \"tribe\" is non-existent in the Circassian culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Caucasian War]] most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the princedoms were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.\n\nThe main groups within the Circassian people are the [[Adygeans]], [[Abzakh people|Abzakh]], [[Kabardians]], and [[Cherkess]]. This does not include tribal subgroups.\n\nMost Adyghe living in [[Circassia]] are Bzhedug, Kabardian, and Temirgoy, while the majority in [[Circassian diaspora|diaspora]] are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug. West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect.\n\nThe twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes.

The Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from east of Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.\n\n{{Location map+|Russia Krasnodar Krai|width=450px|float=right|relief=1|thumb|caption=Approximate location of Circassian princedoms, Tsutsiev's Atlas\n|places=\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.50|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=top|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=40.30|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=right|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=39.45|label='''{{small|Adamey}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.85|long=40.40|label='''[[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b|Yegeruqwai]]'''|position=right|mark=White pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.70|long=40.60|label='''{{small|Makhosh}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=41.50|label='''[[Besleney]]'''|mark=Yellow pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.10|long=41.75|label='''[[Kabardians|Kabardian]]'''[[File:Pfeil rechts.svg|10px]]|position=bottom|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.14|long=38.08|label='''[[Kabardians|Kuban&nbsp;Kabardian]]'''|position=top|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.25|label='''[[Hatuqwai]]'''|position=left|mark=Yellow ffff00 pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=38.60|label='''[[Bzhedug]]'''|mark=Purple pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.30|long=36.80|label='''{{small|Adele}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.10|long=37.40|label=|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.12|long=36.70|label='''[[Zhaney]]'''|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=37.30|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.50|label=|position=right|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=38.25|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|position=bottom|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.62|long=38.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=39.40|label=|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=39.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|position=left|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.62|long=39.70|label='''[[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]'''|position=top|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.95|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.30|long=38.75|label=|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.90|long=39.45|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.50|long=39.50|label='''[[Mamkhegh]]'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.75|long=37.30|label='''{{small|Shegak}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.00|long=41.20|label=[[Abazin]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=42.00|label={{small|Tapanta}}|background=PowderBlue|mark=Pfeil rechts.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.20|long=41.30|label=[[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.86|long=37.37|label=Anapa-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.66|long=37.79|label=Novorossisk-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.54|long=38.05|label=Gelendzhik-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.12|long=39.07|label=Tuapse-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.58|long=39.73|label=Sochi-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.33|long=40.22|label=Gagra-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n}}\nAs for the Circassians proper, apparently called Kiakhs, some writers speak of twelve princedoms and some do not.\n*The narrow '''Black Sea coast''' was occupied, from north to south by the [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], Ubykh, and the [[Sadz]]  The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug princedoms located in north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.\n* The '''north slope''' was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, Abdzakh, and Abaza. They seem to have been the most populous princedoms after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.\n* In the '''far west''' were three small princedoms that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435]] on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ([[:ru:\u0425\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0438]] and [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0441\u0438\u043d]]) near Anapa.\n* Along the '''Kuban''' were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy.\n* On the '''east''', between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai ([[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), Makhosh ([[:ru:\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), [[Besleney]] and Abaza. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. The Tapanta ([[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430]]), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey ([[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b]]) and then the [[Mamkhegh]] near the modern [[Maykop]].\n*The Guaye ([[:ru:\u0413\u0443\u0430\u0439\u0435]]) are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of princedoms migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of [[Karachays]] on the upper Laba without any explanation.\n\nThe princedoms along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding while those in the interior had some protection. The three \"democratic\" princedoms were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other princedoms were controlled by \"princes\" or ''Pshi''. Princedoms with remnants in the Caucasus are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village.\n\n==Circassian diaspora==\n{{Main|Circassian diaspora}}\n[[File:\u00c7erkez s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\u00fcn\u00fcn an\u0131lmas\u0131 1.jpg|thumb|Circassians commemorate the banishment of the Circassians from Russia in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\nMuch of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of their homeland by Russia]in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|ethnic cleansing]] and mass exile mainly to the Ottoman Empire, and to a lesser extent [[Qajar Iran]] and the Balkans.

At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Richmond|first= Walter\n|title= The Circassian Genocide\n|year= 2013\n|publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]]\n|page= back cover|nopp= y\n|isbn= 978-0-8135-6069-4\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LHlwZwpA70cC\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Post-exile period===\nThe Adyghe whom the Ottomans settled in various near-border settlements across the Ottoman Empire ended up living across many territories in the Middle East.

The Abkhazians lived on the coast between the Circassians and the Georgians, were organized as the [[Principality of Abkhazia]] and were involved with the Georgians to some degree. The Abazins or Abaza, their relatives, lived north of the mountains and were involved with Circassia proper.

The seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of [[Imam Shamil]]. The aristocracy was called ''warq''. Some aristocratic families held the rank of ''Pshi'' or prince and the eldest member of this family was the ''Pshi-tkhamade'' who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to ''tfokotl'', roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the ''warq''.\n\nThey were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called ''Khase'' or larger ones called ''Zafes''.\n\nDecisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the ''Pshi-tkhamade'', although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.\n\nIn addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]''. Many houses would have a ''kunakskaya'' or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to ''abreks'' or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or ''kunaks''. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called ''tleuzh'' who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an ''atalyk'' or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. ''Adyghe khabze'' is sometimes called ''[[adat]]'' when it is contrasted to the kind of [[Islamic law]] advocated by people like [[Imam Shamil]].\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n[[File:Traditional clothing, Circassian Heritage Center.JPG|thumb|Traditional Circassian clothing]]\n\nThe traditional female clothing ({{lang-ady |\u0411\u0437\u044b\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0428\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Bz\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|bz\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms.

The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.\n\nThe traditional male costume ({{lang-ady |\u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044a\u0443\u043b\u044a\u0444\u044b\u0433\u044a\u044d \u0448\u044a\u0443\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0440, Ad\u0131\u011fe X\u0301u\u0131\u0142f\u0131\u01f5e \u2c7eua\u015fer}} {{IPA-ady|a\u02d0d\u0259\u0263a \u03c7\u02b7\u0259\u026cf\u0259\u0281a \u0282\u02b7a\u02d0\u0283ar|}}) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors\u2019 times wore coat with short sleeves\u2014in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn).\n\nA compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called ''[[shashka]]''. It is a special kind of [[sabre]]; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word \"Sashkhwa\" ({{lang-ady |\u0421\u0430\u0448\u044c\u0445\u044a\u0443\u044d, Sas\u0328x\u0301ue}}) which means \"long knife\". On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n[[File:Old Circassian traditional house.jpg|thumb|An old country house and traditional cuisine with [[Haliva]] (\u0425\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240wa) and [[Mataz]] (\u041c\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u044d, Metaze), two of the prominent traditional Adyghe snacks.]]\n\nThe Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yHeq6UZxf8 |title=Jordanian Cuisine(Bedouins, Circassians, & Palestinians)(\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ref_ac\">{{cite web|editor=Amjad Jaimoukha|editor-link=Amjad Jaimoukha|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|title=Circassian Cuisine|publisher=Circassianworld.com|accessdate=20 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306214324/http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref> In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as ''[[ficcin]]''.\n\n[[Circassian cheese]] is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the [[North Caucasus]].\n\nA popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.\n\nVariants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.\n\nOn holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make ''[[haliva]]'' ({{lang-ady|\u0445\u044c\u044d\u043b\u0436\u044a\u043e, Hel\u0240ua}}) (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies.

The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its{{clarify|date=September 2014}} colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by [[Populus|poplar]] leaves ({{lang-ady| \u0435\u043a\u04cf\u044d\u043f\u0446\u04cf\u044d, Ye\u00e7'epc'e}} {{IPA-ady|jat\u0361\u0283\u02bcapt\u0361s\u02bca|}}).\n\nThe carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.\n\nThe carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ({{lang-ady| \u0448\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0447\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, \u015exuen\u00e7\u0131mre}} {{IPA-ady|\u0283x\u02b7ant\u0361\u0283\u0259mra|}}) and pistols ({{lang-ady| \u043a\u044a\u044d\u043b\u0430\u0435\u044b\u043c\u0440\u044d, Qelaye\u0131mre}}), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.\n\nThe carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage][[prayer rug]].

They had slightly different dialects.\n\nDialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into princedoms (tribes) after the death of [[Inal of Kabardia]], who united Circassia for the last time before its short reunion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the princedoms became harder, each princedom became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each princedom developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their princedoms. After a longer while, the people began being called after the princedom which they live under the banner of. Therefore, there is a widespread misconception of these princedoms actually being tribes. Opposed to that, the notion \"tribe\" is non-existent in the Circassian culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Caucasian War]] most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the princedoms were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.\n\nThe main groups within the Circassian people are the [[Adygeans]], [[Abzakh people|Abzakh]], [[Kabardians]], and [[Cherkess]]. This does not include tribal subgroups.\n\nMost Adyghe living in [[Circassia]] are Bzhedug, Kabardian, and Temirgoy, while the majority in [[Circassian diaspora|diaspora]] are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug. West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect.\n\nThe twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes. The twelve tribes are the Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai, and Zhaney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|title=Circassians|publisher=adiga-home.net|accessdate=20 August 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820015838/https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|archivedate=20 August 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ | Twelve Circassian (Adyghe) tribes (sub-ethnic groups)\n|-\n!Geographical designation\n!Main dialect\n!Tribe<ref name=Brill>\"\u010cerkesses\".

The Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from east of Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.\n\n{{Location map+|Russia Krasnodar Krai|width=450px|float=right|relief=1|thumb|caption=Approximate location of Circassian princedoms, Tsutsiev's Atlas\n|places=\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.50|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=top|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=40.30|label='''[[Temirgoy]]'''|position=right|mark=Red pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=39.45|label='''{{small|Adamey}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.85|long=40.40|label='''[[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b|Yegeruqwai]]'''|position=right|mark=White pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.70|long=40.60|label='''{{small|Makhosh}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=41.50|label='''[[Besleney]]'''|mark=Yellow pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.10|long=41.75|label='''[[Kabardians|Kabardian]]'''[[File:Pfeil rechts.svg|10px]]|position=bottom|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.14|long=38.08|label='''[[Kabardians|Kuban&nbsp;Kabardian]]'''|position=top|mark=Gold pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=39.25|label='''[[Hatuqwai]]'''|position=left|mark=Yellow ffff00 pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.90|long=38.60|label='''[[Bzhedug]]'''|mark=Purple pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.30|long=36.80|label='''{{small|Adele}}'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.10|long=37.40|label=|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.12|long=36.70|label='''[[Zhaney]]'''|mark=Cyan pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=45.00|long=37.30|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.50|label=|position=right|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=38.25|label='''[[Natukhai]]'''|position=bottom|mark=Turquoise pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.62|long=38.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.40|long=39.40|label=|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=39.80|label='''[[Abdzakh]]'''|position=left|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.62|long=39.70|label='''[[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]'''|position=top|mark=Black pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.80|long=37.95|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.30|long=38.75|label=|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.90|long=39.45|label='''[[Shapsug]]'''|position=left|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.50|long=39.50|label='''[[Mamkhegh]]'''|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.75|long=37.30|label='''{{small|Shegak}}'''|position=right|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.00|long=41.20|label=[[Abazin]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.20|long=42.00|label={{small|Tapanta}}|background=PowderBlue|mark=Pfeil rechts.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.20|long=41.30|label=[[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]]|label_size=120|background=PowderBlue|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.86|long=37.37|label=Anapa-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.66|long=37.79|label=Novorossisk-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.54|long=38.05|label=Gelendzhik-|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=44.12|long=39.07|label=Tuapse-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.58|long=39.73|label=Sochi-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n {{Location map~|Russia Krasnodar Krai|lat=43.33|long=40.22|label=Gagra-----|position=left|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n\n}}\nAs for the Circassians proper, apparently called Kiakhs, some writers speak of twelve princedoms and some do not.\n*The narrow '''Black Sea coast''' was occupied, from north to south by the [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], Ubykh, and the [[Sadz]]  The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug princedoms located in north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.\n* The '''north slope''' was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, Abdzakh, and Abaza. They seem to have been the most populous princedoms after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.\n* In the '''far west''' were three small princedoms that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435]] on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ([[:ru:\u0425\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0438]] and [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0441\u0438\u043d]]) near Anapa.\n* Along the '''Kuban''' were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy.\n* On the '''east''', between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai ([[:ru:\u0415\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), Makhosh ([[:ru:\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b]]), [[Besleney]] and Abaza. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. The Tapanta ([[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430]]), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey ([[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b]]) and then the [[Mamkhegh]] near the modern [[Maykop]].\n*The Guaye ([[:ru:\u0413\u0443\u0430\u0439\u0435]]) are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of princedoms migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of [[Karachays]] on the upper Laba without any explanation.\n\nThe princedoms along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding while those in the interior had some protection. The three \"democratic\" princedoms were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other princedoms were controlled by \"princes\" or ''Pshi''. Princedoms with remnants in the Caucasus are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village.\n\n==Circassian diaspora==\n{{Main|Circassian diaspora}}\n[[File:\u00c7erkez s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\u00fcn\u00fcn an\u0131lmas\u0131 1.jpg|thumb|Circassians commemorate the banishment of the Circassians from Russia in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\nMuch of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of their homeland by Russia]in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|ethnic cleansing]] and mass exile mainly to the Ottoman Empire, and to a lesser extent [[Qajar Iran]] and the Balkans.

Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, [[Odaenathus]]. Her husband became king in 260, elevating [[Palmyra]] to supreme power in the [[Near East]] by defeating the [[Sassanians]] and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the [[regent]] of her son [[Vaballathus]] and held ''de facto'' power throughout his reign.\n\nIn 270, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]. By mid-271 her realm extended from [[Ancyra]], central [[Anatolia]], to [[Upper Egypt|southern Egypt]], although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to Roman emperor [[Aurelian]]'s campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life.\n\nZenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.\n\n==Name, appearance and sources==\n{{quote|text=Her face was dark and of a swarthy hue, her eyes were black and powerful beyond the usual wont, her spirit divinely great, and her beauty incredible.

Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, [[Odaenathus]]. Her husband became king in 260, elevating [[Palmyra]] to supreme power in the [[Near East]] by defeating the [[Sassanians]] and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the [[regent]] of her son [[Vaballathus]] and held ''de facto'' power throughout his reign.\n\nIn 270, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]. By mid-271 her realm extended from [[Ancyra]], central [[Anatolia]], to [[Upper Egypt|southern Egypt]], although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to Roman emperor [[Aurelian]]'s campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life.\n\nZenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.\n\n==Name, appearance and sources==\n{{quote|text=Her face was dark and of a swarthy hue, her eyes were black and powerful beyond the usual wont, her spirit divinely great, and her beauty incredible.
