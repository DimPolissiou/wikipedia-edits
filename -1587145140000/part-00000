It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n{{original research|section|date=April 2020}}\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' the year before. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"''.\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\".

The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.\n* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme ''[[Noel's House Party]]''.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Dimensions in Time'' achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of ''Doctor Who'' ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of ''[[City of Death]]'', at 16.1 million viewers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Scripts/DIT/intro.html Doctor Who Scripts Project page for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*{{BBCCDW| id=dimensionstime | title= Dimensions in Time}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622072451/http://www.doctorwhoworld.org.uk/dimensions.htm ''Doctor Who World'' episode guide entry for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*[http://drwhoguide.com/mp3/dimens.mp3 Title music]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/toby-hadoke-s-who-s-round-128---david-roden-1337 Toby Hadoke\u2019s Who\u2019s Round - David Roden] - interview with writer\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n{{First Doctor stories}}\n{{Cybermen stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who crossovers]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who multi-Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who spin-offs]]\n[[Category:EastEnders spin-offs]]\n[[Category:Third Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fourth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fifth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Sixth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who charity episodes]]\n[[Category:Children in Need]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:3D television programs]]\n[[Category:Anniversary television episodes]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n[[Category:Crossover television]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2013]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| serial_name        = Dimensions in Time\n| show               = DW\n| type               = serial / charity crossover with ''[[EastEnders]]''\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| doctors            =\n* [[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n*[[Colin Baker]] ([[Sixth Doctor]])\n*[[Peter Davison]] ([[Fifth Doctor]])\n*[[Tom Baker]] ([[Fourth Doctor]])\n*[[Jon Pertwee]] ([[Third Doctor]])\n| companions         =\n* [[Sophie Aldred]] ([[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]])\n* [[John Leeson]] (Voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]])\n* [[Bonnie Langford]] ([[Melanie Bush]])\n* [[Nicola Bryant]] ([[Peri Brown]])\n* [[Sarah Sutton]] ([[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]])\n* [[Lalla Ward]] ([[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]])\n* [[Louise Jameson]] ([[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]])\n* [[Elisabeth Sladen]] ([[Sarah Jane Smith]])\n* [[Richard Franklin (actor)|Richard Franklin]] ([[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]])\n* [[Caroline John]] ([[Liz Shaw]])\n* [[Nicholas Courtney]] ([[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]])\n* [[Deborah Watling]] ([[Victoria Waterfield]])\n* [[Carole Ann Ford]] ([[Susan Foreman]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Kate O'Mara]] \u2014 [[Rani (Doctor Who)|The Rani]]\n*[[Samuel West]] \u2014 Cyrian\n*[[Deepak Verma]] \u2014 [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]]\n*[[Shobu Kapoor]] \u2014 [[Gita Kapoor]]\n*[[Wendy Richard]] \u2014 [[Pauline Fowler]]\n*[[Gillian Taylforth]] \u2014 [[Kathy Beale]]\n*[[Letitia Dean]] \u2014 [[Sharon Watts]]\n*[[Pam St. Clement]] \u2014 [[Pat Butcher]]\n*[[Nicola Stapleton]] \u2014 [[Mandy Salter]]\n*[[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] \u2014 [[Frank Butcher]]\n*[[Adam Woodyatt]] \u2014 [[Ian Beale]]\n*[[Steve McFadden]] \u2014 [[Phil Mitchell]]\n*[[Ross Kemp]] \u2014 [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]\n| director           = Stuart McDonald\n| writer             = [[John Nathan-Turner]]<br/>David Roden\n| producer           = John Nathan-Turner\n| composer           = [[Keff McCulloch]]\n| production_code    = C280X<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dimensionstime/detail.shtml |title=BBC - Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Dimensions in Time - Details |accessdate=13 December 2007 |work= }}</ref>\n| length             = 2 episodes, 7 minutes and 5 minutes\n| started            = {{Start date|1993|11|26|df=y}}\n| ended              = {{End date|1993|11|27|df=y}}\n| preceding          = ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]''\n| following          = ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''\n}}\n'''''Dimensions in Time''''' is a charity special [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and the [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' that ran in two parts on 26 and 27 November 1993.

The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.\n* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme ''[[Noel's House Party]]''.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Dimensions in Time'' achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of ''Doctor Who'' ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of ''[[City of Death]]'', at 16.1 million viewers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Scripts/DIT/intro.html Doctor Who Scripts Project page for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*{{BBCCDW| id=dimensionstime | title= Dimensions in Time}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622072451/http://www.doctorwhoworld.org.uk/dimensions.htm ''Doctor Who World'' episode guide entry for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*[http://drwhoguide.com/mp3/dimens.mp3 Title music]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/toby-hadoke-s-who-s-round-128---david-roden-1337 Toby Hadoke\u2019s Who\u2019s Round - David Roden] - interview with writer\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n{{First Doctor stories}}\n{{Cybermen stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who crossovers]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who multi-Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who spin-offs]]\n[[Category:EastEnders spin-offs]]\n[[Category:Third Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fourth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fifth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Sixth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who charity episodes]]\n[[Category:Children in Need]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:3D television programs]]\n[[Category:Anniversary television episodes]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n[[Category:Crossover television]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2013]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast notes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time"}

It is a [[sequel]] to the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', but with different actors in the leading roles, [[Harrison Ford]] starring as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] and [[Anne Archer]] as his wife. [[James Earl Jones]] reprises his role as Admiral James Greer. The cast also includes [[Sean Bean]], [[Patrick Bergin]], [[Thora Birch]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[James Fox]], and [[Richard Harris]].\n\nThe film premiered in theaters in the United States on June 5, 1992 and spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. The following film in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|series]], ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'', also starred Ford and Archer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT for more info. -->\nRetired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst Jack Ryan is on vacation with his family in London. They witness a terrorist attack on Lord William Holmes, [[Minister of State for Northern Ireland]]. Ryan intervenes and is injured, but he kills one of the assailants, Patrick Miller, while his older brother Sean Miller looks on. The remaining attackers flee, as Sean is apprehended by the police. While recovering, Ryan is called to testify in court against Miller, who is part of a splinter cell of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. Miller is later convicted for his crimes.\n\nThe leader of the splinter cell, Kevin O'Donnell, meets with IRA brigade commander Jimmy Reardon, who tricks O'Donnell into going into an ambush so he can be assassinated by hitmen. O'Donnell turns the tables on his attackers and kills them all, while O'Donnell's lover Annette assassinates Reardon. While being transferred to [[HM Prison Albany]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], Miller's escort convoy is ambushed by his comrades, including O'Donnell, who execute the police officers, and coordinate an escape. Miller and his companions flee to [[North Africa]] to plan another kidnapping attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller also persuades several members of the group to accompany him to the U.S. to kill Ryan and his family.\n\nAnnette and fellow terrorist Ned Clark attempt to assassinate Ryan outside the [[United States Naval Academy]]. Ryan notices Clark following him and attacks him, but Clark manages to overwhelm Ryan, only to be shot by several Marines. Later, Miller and a henchman attack Ryan's pregnant wife and daughter on a busy highway, injuring them both. Enraged over the attack on his family, Ryan decides to go back to work for the CIA, having earlier rejected the appeal of his former superior, Vice Admiral James Greer.\n\nRyan's analysis leads him to conclude that Miller has taken refuge in a training camp in [[North Africa]]. A [[Special Air Service]] team attacks and kills everyone in the camp while Ryan looks on through a live satellite feed. Unbeknownst to Ryan, Miller and his companions have already left the camp and are on their way to the U.S. to stage their next attack.\n\nLord Holmes decides to visit Ryan at his home to formally present his honorary knighthood in recognition of his role in foiling the first attack on Holmes. With the aid of Holmes' traitorous assistant, Miller's group tracks Holmes to Ryan's coastside home in Maryland. They kill the [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agents and state troopers guarding the residence, and make an attempt to kidnap Lord Holmes. Ryan leads Holmes and his family to safety.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[Hostage Rescue Team]] scrambles to pick up Holmes. Ryan develops a ruse to leave his family and Lord Holmes behind, near the shoreline, while racing away from the coast on a boat. Miller, O'Donnell and Annette follow suit, and chase him in a secondary boat. Upon realizing that Ryan is leading them away from Holmes, O'Donnell and Annette try to persuade him to turn around. But an enraged Miller kills them both and continues his pursuit of Ryan. Miller reaches Ryan's boat, jumps aboard, and attacks Ryan. During their fight, Ryan impales Miller on an anchor, killing him. Ryan jumps clear of the boat just before it crashes into several rocks, and is rescued by an FBI helicopter.\n\nSometime later, we find the Ryans about to have breakfast, when Ryan's wife receives a call from her obstetrician giving her the baby's latest test results. The film cuts to the credits before the gender of the baby is revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Samuel L Jackson at San Diego ComicCon 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel L.

It is a [[sequel]] to the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', but with different actors in the leading roles, [[Harrison Ford]] starring as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] and [[Anne Archer]] as his wife. [[James Earl Jones]] reprises his role as Admiral James Greer. The cast also includes [[Sean Bean]], [[Patrick Bergin]], [[Thora Birch]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[James Fox]], and [[Richard Harris]].\n\nThe film premiered in theaters in the United States on June 5, 1992 and spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. The following film in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|series]], ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'', also starred Ford and Archer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT for more info. -->\nRetired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst Jack Ryan is on vacation with his family in London. They witness a terrorist attack on Lord William Holmes, [[Minister of State for Northern Ireland]]. Ryan intervenes and is injured, but he kills one of the assailants, Patrick Miller, while his older brother Sean Miller looks on. The remaining attackers flee, as Sean is apprehended by the police. While recovering, Ryan is called to testify in court against Miller, who is part of a splinter cell of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. Miller is later convicted for his crimes.\n\nThe leader of the splinter cell, Kevin O'Donnell, meets with IRA brigade commander Jimmy Reardon, who tricks O'Donnell into going into an ambush so he can be assassinated by hitmen. O'Donnell turns the tables on his attackers and kills them all, while O'Donnell's lover Annette assassinates Reardon. While being transferred to [[HM Prison Albany]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], Miller's escort convoy is ambushed by his comrades, including O'Donnell, who execute the police officers, and coordinate an escape. Miller and his companions flee to [[North Africa]] to plan another kidnapping attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller also persuades several members of the group to accompany him to the U.S. to kill Ryan and his family.\n\nAnnette and fellow terrorist Ned Clark attempt to assassinate Ryan outside the [[United States Naval Academy]]. Ryan notices Clark following him and attacks him, but Clark manages to overwhelm Ryan, only to be shot by several Marines. Later, Miller and a henchman attack Ryan's pregnant wife and daughter on a busy highway, injuring them both. Enraged over the attack on his family, Ryan decides to go back to work for the CIA, having earlier rejected the appeal of his former superior, Vice Admiral James Greer.\n\nRyan's analysis leads him to conclude that Miller has taken refuge in a training camp in [[North Africa]]. A [[Special Air Service]] team attacks and kills everyone in the camp while Ryan looks on through a live satellite feed. Unbeknownst to Ryan, Miller and his companions have already left the camp and are on their way to the U.S. to stage their next attack.\n\nLord Holmes decides to visit Ryan at his home to formally present his honorary knighthood in recognition of his role in foiling the first attack on Holmes. With the aid of Holmes' traitorous assistant, Miller's group tracks Holmes to Ryan's coastside home in Maryland. They kill the [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agents and state troopers guarding the residence, and make an attempt to kidnap Lord Holmes. Ryan leads Holmes and his family to safety.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[Hostage Rescue Team]] scrambles to pick up Holmes. Ryan develops a ruse to leave his family and Lord Holmes behind, near the shoreline, while racing away from the coast on a boat. Miller, O'Donnell and Annette follow suit, and chase him in a secondary boat. Upon realizing that Ryan is leading them away from Holmes, O'Donnell and Annette try to persuade him to turn around. But an enraged Miller kills them both and continues his pursuit of Ryan. Miller reaches Ryan's boat, jumps aboard, and attacks Ryan. During their fight, Ryan impales Miller on an anchor, killing him. Ryan jumps clear of the boat just before it crashes into several rocks, and is rescued by an FBI helicopter.\n\nSometime later, we find the Ryans about to have breakfast, when Ryan's wife receives a call from her obstetrician giving her the baby's latest test results. The film cuts to the credits before the gender of the baby is revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Samuel L Jackson at San Diego ComicCon 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel L.

{"title_page": "Electric bicycle laws", "text_new": "[[File:Barry on the Schwinn Tailwind (3248944250).jpg|thumbnail]]\nMany countries have enacted '''electric  vehicle laws''' to regulate the use of [[electric bicycle]]s. Countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] have federal regulations governing the safety requirements and standards of manufacture. Other countries like the signatories of the [[European Union]] have agreed to wider-ranging legislation covering use and safety of their term EPAC (electric vehicles)\n\nHowever, laws and terminology are diverse.  Some countries have national regulations but leave the legality of road use for states and provinces to decide.  Municipal laws and restrictions add further complications.  Systems of classification and nomenclature also vary.  Jurisdictions may address \"power-assisted bicycle\" (Canada) or \"power-assisted cycle\" (United Kingdom) or \"electric pedal-assisted cycles\" (European Union) or simply \"electric bicycles\".  Some classify [[pedelec]]s as distinct from other bikes using electric power.  Thus, the same hardware may be subject to many different classifications and regulations.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia the e-bike is defined by the Australian Vehicle Standards as a bicycle that has an auxiliary motor with a maximum power output not exceeding 250&nbsp;W without consideration for speed limits or pedal sensors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geoff|first=Rose|title=Encouraging e-bike use \u2013 the need for regulatory reform in Australia|url=http://eng.monash.edu.au/civil/assets/document/research/centres/its/confs-workshops/archive/rose-tram.pdf|publisher=Monash University}}</ref> Each state is responsible for deciding how to treat such a vehicle and currently all states agree that such a vehicle does not require licensing or registration. Various groups are lobbying for an increase in this low limit to encourage more widespread use of e-bikes to assist in mobility, health benefits and to reduce congestion, pollution and road danger. Some states have their own rules such as no riding under electric power on bike paths and through built up areas so riders should view the state laws regarding their use. There is no licence and no registration required for e-bike usage.\n\nSince 30 May 2012, Australia has an additional new e-bike category using the [[European Union]] model of a [[pedelec]] as per the [[European Committee for Standardization|CE]] EN15194 standard. This means the e-bike can have a motor of 250W of continuous rated power which can only be activated by pedalling (if above 6&nbsp;km/h) and must cut out over 25&nbsp;km/h&nbsp;\u2013 if so it is classed as a normal bicycle. The state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the first to amend their local road rules, see below.\n\nRoad vehicles in Australia must comply with all applicable Australian Design Rules (ADRs)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/motor/design/adr_online.aspx |title=Third Edition Australian Design Rules |website=Infrastructure.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref> before they can be supplied to the market for use in transport (Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 Cwth).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401524?OpenDocument |title=Federal Register of Legislation \u2013 Australian Government |website=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThe ADRs contain the following definitions for bicycles and mopeds:\n\n*4.2.

MOPED - 2 Wheels (LA)\n\nA 2-wheeled motor vehicle, not being a power-assisted pedal cycle, with an engine cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 ml and a \"Maximum Motor Cycle Speed\"  not exceeding 50&nbsp;km/h; or a 2-wheeled motor vehicle with a power source other than a piston engine and a \"Maximum Motor Cycle Speed\" not exceeding 50&nbsp;km/h.\n\n(Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule&nbsp;\u2013 Definitions and Vehicle Categories 2005 Compilation 3 19 September 2007).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrumentCompilation1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/2D9B915E8B3806F5CA2573690015E79A |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630205635/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrumentCompilation1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/2D9B915E8B3806F5CA2573690015E79A |archivedate=2008-06-30 }}</ref>\n\nThere are no ADRs applicable to AA or AB category vehicles.  There are ADRs for lighting, braking, noise, controls and dimensions for LA category vehicles, mostly referencing the equivalent UN ECE Regulations.

Riders of cycles exempt from registration must follow the same rules as for cycles without motors, and vehicles requiring registration (mopeds) are treated as motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/registration/otherinformation/scootersminibikes.html |title=Registration |website=Rta.nsw.gov |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as of October 2014 all petrol powered cycles are banned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/bicyclists/petrol-powered-bicycles.html |title=Petrol powered bicycles - Cyclists - Staying safe - NSW Centre for Road Safety |publisher=Roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n===Victoria===\nA bicycle, which is designed to be propelled by human power using pedals, may have an electric or petrol powered motor attached provided the motor's maximum power output does not exceed 200 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Motorcycles/RoadRulesRegulations/MiniatureMotorbikesAndMotorisedScooters.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725090531/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Motorcycles/RoadRulesRegulations/MiniatureMotorbikesAndMotorisedScooters.htm |archivedate=2008-07-25 }}</ref>\n\nAs of 18 September 2012, the Victorian road rules have changed to enable a [[pedelec]] to be used as a bicycle in Victoria.

There are two types of legal motorised bicycle. For the first type, the electric motor must not be capable of generating more than 270 watts of power. For the second type, known as a \"pedalec\", the vehicle must comply with the European Standard for Power Assisted Pedal Cycles (EN15194).\n\nThe pedals on a motorised bicycle must be the primary source of power for the vehicle. If the motor is the primary source of power then the device cannot be classed as a motorised bicycle. For example, a device where the rider can twist a throttle and complete a journey using motor power only without using the pedals, would not be classed as a motorised bicycle.\n\nMotorised bicycles can be ridden on all roads and paths, except where bicycles are specifically excluded. Riders do not need to have a driver licence to ride a motorised bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/Registration/Registering-vehicles/Wheelchairs-and-small-devices/Motorised-foot-scooters-and-motorised-bicycles.aspx |title=Bicycles, skateboards, foot scooters and similar &#124; Transport and motoring &#124; Queensland Government |publisher=Tmr.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n==Canada==\n\nEight provinces of Canada allow electric power assisted bicycles.

All require an approved helmet. Regulations may or may not require an interlock to prevent use of power when the rider is not pedaling. Some versions (e.g., if capable of operating without pedaling) of e-bikes require drivers' licenses in some provinces and have age restrictions.  Vehicle licenses and liability insurance are not required.  Generally, they are considered [[Vehicular cycling|vehicles]] (like motorcycles and pedal cycles), so are subject to the same [[Traffic|rules of the road]] as regular bicycles.  In some cases, regulatory requirements have been complicated by lobbying in respect of the [[Segway PT]].\n\nBicycles assisted by a gasoline motor or other fuel are regulated differently from e-bikes.  These are classified as motorcycles, regardless of the power output of the motor and maximum attainable speed.\n\nNote that in Canada, the term \"assist bicycle\" is the technical term for an e-bike{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and \"power-assisted bicycle\" is used in the [[List of Acts of Parliament of Canada|Canadian Federal Legislation]], but is carefully defined to only apply to electric motor assist, and specifically excludes internal combustion engines (though this is not the case in the United States).\n\n===Federal requirements===\nSince 2000, Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations (MVSR) have defined Power Assisted bicycles (PABs) as a separate category, and which require no license to operate.  PABs are currently defined as a two- or three-wheeled bicycle equipped with handlebars and operable pedals, an attached electric motor of 500W or less, and a maximum speed capability of 32&nbsp;km/h from the motor over level ground.  Other requirements include a permanently affixed label from the manufacturer in a conspicuous location stating the vehicle is a power-assisted bicycle under the statutory requirements in force at the time of manufacture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/crc-c-1038/latest/crc-c-1038.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124191729/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/crc-c-1038/latest/crc-c-1038.html |archivedate=2009-11-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/mediaroom/backgrounders/b01-R050.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217030859/http://www.tc.gc.ca/mediaroom/backgrounders/b01-R050.htm |archivedate=2005-12-17 }}</ref>  All power-assisted bicycles must utilize an electric motor for assisted propulsion.\n\nA power-assisted bicycle may be imported and exported freely within Canada without the same restrictions placed on auto-mobiles or a moped.

E-bike riders are subject to the same penalties as other cyclists for all other traffic offences.\n\n====Manitoba====\nE-bikes are legal in Manitoba, so long as certain stipulations are met.  The bike must not be designed to have more than three wheels touching the ground, the motor must stop providing motive power if the bike exceeds 32&nbsp;km/h for any reason, the motor must be smaller than 500W, it has to have functioning pedals, if it's engaged by a throttle, the motor immediately stops providing the vehicle with motive power when the driver activates a brake, and if engaged by the driver applying muscle power to the pedals, the motor immediately stops providing the vehicle with motive power when the driver stops applying muscle power.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\">[https://www.mpi.mb.ca/en/Rd-Safety/Cycling/pages/laws.aspx Article on the ''Manitoba Public Insurance'' website]</ref>  The bike must also have either a mechanism to turn the electric motor on and off that can be operated by the driver, and if the vehicle has a throttle, is separate from the throttle, or a mechanism that prevents the motor from engaging until the vehicle is traveling at 3&nbsp;km/h or more.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\"/>  You must also be at least 14 years of age to operate an E-bike.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\"/>  All other Manitoba laws regarding cycling also apply.\n\n====New Brunswick====\nTo be allowed on the road it needs wheel rims larger than 9 inches, have a headlight for night, a seat at least 27 inches off the ground.\n\nNew Brunswick's Policy on Electric Motor Driven Cycles and Electric Bicycles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/services/services_renderer.200814.html |title=Motor Vehicle Registration |website=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Registrar will permit an electric motor driven cycle to be registered if it meets Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) as a Limited Speed Motorcycle, or Scooter as is done with gas powered motor driven cycles. If the vehicle was manufactured after 1988 it will bear a compliance label stating that it meets these standards. The operator will be subject to all the requirements placed on operators of motor driven cycles.\n\nIf the vehicle is able to powered by human force and has a motor 500W or less, and the motor is not capable of assisting when the vehicle is traveling at a speed greater than 32&nbsp;km/h then it can be considered a bicycle and all the requirements placed on bicyclists are applicable.\n\nIt is important to note that if a vehicle has an electric motor greater than 500 watts and is capable of powering the vehicle when traveling at a speed greater than 32&nbsp;km/h and it does not have a CMVSS compliance label it cannot be registered unless the owner can prove, by having the vehicle certified by an engineer, that it is safe for operation on NB highways. Also, not all vehicles are suitable for operation on NB highways and it could be that the vehicle in question may not be a motor driven cycle or a bicycle and cannot be operated on the highway at all.\n\nPower Assisted Bicycle Label:\n\nManufacturers of e-bikes must permanently affix a label, in a conspicuous location, stating in both official languages that the vehicle is a power-assisted bicycle as defined in the regulations under the federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Homemade e-bikes will not have this label.\n\nNOTE 1: The previous version of the policy had a section on it needing to \"look like a bike\" or a \"bike style frame\" but never defined what those were. That has been dropped and is no longer part of the new policy.\n\nNOTE 2: The top speed of the bike if propelled by human power is the posted speed limit, but the motor is only allowed to get you up to and keep you at 32&nbsp;km/hr. If the posted limit is under 32 then the posted limit is the limit allowed.\n\nNOTE 3: There is no maximum weight limit.\n\nNOTE 4: Ebikes are allowed to use cargo trailers/kid trailers.\n\nNOTE 5: There is no minimum age set.\n\nNOTE 6: DUI \u2013 If you have a DUI conviction the restrictions of the DUI override the ebike policy definition of an ebike as a bicycle and put it into the motor vehicle category.\n\n====Newfoundland====\nsomething\n\n====Nova Scotia====\nIn Nova Scotia power-assisted bicycles are classified similarly to standard pedal bicycles. The Nova Scotia Motor Vehicle Act defines a power-assisted bicycle as a bicycle with an electric motor of 500 watts or less, with two wheels (one of which is at least 350&nbsp;mm) or four wheels (two of which are at least 350mm). PABs are permitted on the road in the province of Nova Scotia as long as you wear an approved bicycle helmet with the chinstrap engaged.  They do not have to meet the conditions defined within the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations for a motorcycle (they are not classed as \"motor vehicles\"), but they do have to comply with federal regulations that define Power Assisted Bicycles.\n\n====Prince Edward Island====\nAre treated as Mopeds and will need to pass inspection as a moped.\n\n====Quebec====\n\nIn [[Quebec]] power-assisted bicycles are often classified similarly to standard pedal bicycles. They do not have to meet the conditions defined within the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations (they are not classed as \"motor vehicles\"), but they do have to comply with federal regulations that define Power Assisted Bicycles. The Quebec Highway Safety Code defines a power-assisted bicycle as a bicycle(2 or 3 wheels that touch the ground) with an electric motor with a maximum power of 500W and a top speed of 32&nbsp;km/h bearing a specific compliance label permanently attached by the manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/electric-bike/|title=Riding an Electric Bike|last=SAAQ|website=SAAQ|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref>  PABs are permitted on the road in the province of Quebec, but riders have to be 14 and over to ride the electric bicycle and if they're under the age of 18, must have a moped or scooter license.\n\n====Saskatchewan====\nPower assisted bicycles are classified in two categories in [[Saskatchewan]].  An ''electric assist bicycle'' is a 2 or 3-wheeled bicycle {{sic|hide=y}} that uses pedals and a motor at the same time only.  A ''power cycle'' uses either pedals and motor or motor only.  Both must have engines with 500 watt power or less, and must not be able exceed 32&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph), i.e., electric motor cuts out at this speed or cycle is unable to go this fast on a level surface.  The power cycle has to meet the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) for a ''power-assisted bicycle''.  The power cycle requires at least a learner's driving licence (class 7), and all of the other classes 1\u20135 may operate these also.  The electric assist bicycle does not require a licence.  Helmets are required for each.  Both are treated as bicycles regarding rules of the road.  Gas powered or assisted bicycles are classified as motorcycles regardless of engine size or if using pedals plus motor.  Stickers identifying the bicycle's compliance with the Federal classification may be required for power cycles by some cities or municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.sk.ca/sgi_pub/instructional/motorcycledrivers/2009/16.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203628/http://www.sgi.sk.ca/sgi_pub/instructional/motorcycledrivers/2009/16.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n==China ==\n===Mainland===\nIn China, e-bikes currently come under the same classification as bicycles and hence don't require a driver's license to operate.

In the southern Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen, e-bikes, like all motorcycles, are banned from certain downtown districts.

Electric bicycles operated at speeds of twenty miles an hour or more, but less than twenty-five miles per hour may be registered for legal use on the roadways as mopeds, and above twenty-five miles per hour as a registered moped with an 'M' endorsement on the operator's driving license.  However, mopeds in Arizona are prohibited from using bike lanes on motor vehicle roadways.  The Arizona statute governing motorized electric bicycles does not prohibit local jurisdictions from adopting an ordinance that further regulates or prohibits the operation of motorized electric bicycles or tricycles.<ref>Under Arizona law, local jurisdictions can impose additional regulations such as lower speed limits or even prohibit usage altogether, but they cannot require state or local licensing or registration of electric bicycles or tricycles that otherwise meet the definition of a motorized bicycle or tricycle under the state statute.</ref>\n\n====Arkansas====\nArkansas does not define E-bikes.

The current regulations define an \"electric bicycle\", a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts, separated into three classes:\n{{quote|A \"class 1 electric bicycle,\" or \"low-speed pedal-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. (2) A \"class 2 electric bicycle,\" or \"low-speed throttle-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. A \"class 3 electric bicycle,\" or \"speed pedal-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 miles per hour, and equipped with a speedometer. Local government ordinances are allowed to permit or ban any class of electric bicycles on dedicated bicycle paths and trails, with Class 1 & 2 permitted, and Class 3 banned, by default.}}\nBeginning January 1, 2017, manufacturers and distributors of electric bicycles will be required to apply a label that is permanently affixed, in a prominent location, to each electric bicycle, indicating its class.  Should a user \"tamper with or modify\" an electric bicycle, changing the speed capability, they must replace the label indicating the classification.\n \nDriver's licenses, registration, insurance and license plate requirements do not apply. An electric bicycle is not a motor vehicle. Drinking and driving laws apply.  Additional laws or ordinances may apply to the use of electric bicycles by each city or county.\n\n====Colorado====\nEbike definition in Colorado follows the HR 727 National Law: {{convert|20|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} e-power and {{Convert|750|W|hp|0|abbr=on}} max, 2 or 3 wheels, pedals that work.

''Motorized bicycle'' is a pedal bicycle which has a helper motor, or a non-pedal bicycle which has a motor, with a cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters, an automatic transmission, and which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than thirty miles per hour. ''Motorcycle'' includes any bicycle with a motor or driving wheel attached, with the exception of vehicles that fall under the specific definition of motorized bicycle. Thus, a pedal bicycle with an electric motor or a non-pedal bicycle with an electric motor, automatic transmission, and maximum speed of 30 miles an hour would fall under the definition of motorized bicycle. An electric bicycle that did not meet those restrictions would be either a motorized scooter or motorcycle, depending on specific characteristics.\n\nA motorized bicycle shall not be operated by any person under sixteen years of age, nor at a speed in excess of twenty-five miles per hour, upon any public highway, private way laid out under authority of statute, way dedicated to public use, or way under the control of park commissioners or body having like powers, within the commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/90-1B.htm |title=General Laws: CHAPTER 90, Section 1B |website=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>  A motorized bicycle shall not be operated on any way by any person not possessing a valid driver's license or learner's permit.

Motorized bicycles may be operated on bicycle lanes adjacent to the various ways, but shall be excluded from off-street recreational bicycle paths. Every person operating a motorized bicycle or riding as a passenger on a motorized bicycle shall wear protective headgear conforming with such minimum standards of construction and performance as the registrar may prescribe, and no person operating a motorized bicycle shall permit any other person to ride a passenger on such motorized bicycle unless such passenger is wearing such protective headgear.\n\nA response to an inquiry made to the Mass DOT/RMV indicates that Massachusetts does recognize the federal low speed electric bicycle Federal Law (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2085) and interprets that to mean these ebikes do not require license or registration. However, some of the materials available on the RMV website do not distinguish between \"Motorized Bicycle\" and low power ebikes.

Other types of vehicles, such as electric scooters, \"pocket rockets\" and mini-choppers, may fit the definition of a moped or a motorcycle, but cannot be registered by the Department of State if they lack the equipment required by law to legally drive on public roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1585_15242-236804--,00.html |title=SOS \u2013 Riding a Moped Safely |publisher=Michigan.gov |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n====Minnesota====\nElectric-assisted bicycles, also referred to as \"e-bikes,\" are a subset of bicycles that are equipped with a small attached motor.  To be classified as an \"electric-assisted bicycle\" in Minnesota, the bicycle must have a saddle and operable pedals, two or three wheels, and an electric motor of up to 1,000 watts, as well as meet certain federal motor vehicle safety standards. The motor must disengage during braking and have a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour (whether assisted by human power or not). Minn. Stat. \u00a7169.011, subd. 27.\n\nLegislative changes in 2012 significantly altered the classification and regulatory structure for e-bikes. The general effect was to establish electric-assisted bicycles as a subset of bicycles and regulate e-bikes in roughly the same manner as bicycles instead of other motorized devices with two (or three) wheels.  Laws 2012, ch. 287, art. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 15-17, 21, 23-26, 30, 32-33, and 41. The 2012 Legislature also modified and clarified regulation of e-bikes on bike paths and trails. Laws 2012, ch. 287, art. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4, 20.\n\nFollowing the 2012 change, electric-assisted bicycles are regulated similarly to other bicycles. Most of the same laws apply. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 \u00a7169.011, subd. 27; 169.222.\n\nThe bicycle does not need to be registered, and a title is no longer necessary. Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 168.012, subd. 2d;168A.03, subd. 1 clause(11)\n\nA license plate is no longer required to be displayed on the rear. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.79, subd. 3. It is not subject to motor vehicle sales tax (the general sales tax would instead be owed on e-bike purchases).\n\nA driver's license or permit is not required. Unlike a non-powered bicycle, the minimum operator age is 15 years old.  Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subd. 6a.\n\nThe device does not need to be insured.  See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.43, subds. 2, 13.\n\nElectric-assisted bicycle operators must follow the same traffic laws as operators of motor vehicles (except those that by their nature would not be relevant).  The bicycles may be operated two abreast. Operators must generally ride as close as is practical to the right-hand side of the road (exceptions include when overtaking another vehicle, preparing for a left turn, and to avoid unsafe conditions). The bicycle must be ridden within a single lane. Travel on the shoulder of a road must be in the same direction as the direction of adjacent traffic.\n\nSome prohibitions also apply, such as on: carrying cargo that prevents keeping at least one hand on the handlebars or prevents proper use of brakes, riding no more than two abreast on a roadway or shoulder, and attaching the bicycle to another vehicle. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subds. 3-5. The vehicles may be operated on a sidewalk except in a business district or when prohibited by a local unit of government, and must yield to pedestrians on the sidewalk. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.223, subd. 3.  By default, electric-assisted bicycles are allowed on road shoulders as well as on bicycle trails, bicycle paths, and bicycle lanes.\n\nA local unit of government having jurisdiction over a road or bikeway (including the Department of Natural Resources in the case of state bike trails) is authorized to restrict e-bike use if: the use is not consistent with the safety or general welfare of others; or the restriction is necessary to meet the terms of any legal agreements concerning the land on which a bikeway has been established.\n\nElectric-assisted bicycles can be parked on a sidewalk unless restricted by local government (although they cannot impede normal movement of pedestrians) and can be parked on streets where parking of other motor vehicles is allowed. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subd. 9.\n\nDuring nighttime operation, the bicycle must be equipped with a front headlamp, a rear-facing red reflector, and reflectors on the front and rear of pedals, and the bicycle or rider must have reflective surfaces on each side. Minn. Stat. \u00a7169.222, subd. 6.\nAn electric-assisted bicycle can be equipped with a front-facing headlamp that emits a flashing white light, a rear-facing lamp that has a flashing red light, or both. The bicycle can carry studded tires designed for traction (such as in snowy\nor icy conditions).\n\nHelmets are no longer required for e-bike use.\n\n====Mississippi====\nIn Opinion No. 2007-00602 of the Attorney General, Jim Hood clarified that a \"bicycle with a motor attached\" does not satisfy the definition of \"motor vehicle\" under Section 63-3-103. He stated that it is up to the authority creating the bike lane to determine if a bicycle with a motor attached can be ridden in bike lanes. No specifications about the motor were made.\n\nIn Opinion No. 2011-00095 of the Attorney General, Jim Hood stated that an operator's license, helmet, safety insurance, title, registration, and safety inspection are all not required of bicycles with a motor attached.\n\n====Missouri====\nElectric bicycles appear to be considered as \"motorized bicycles\" under Missouri law.

The power source may not be capable of propelling the device, unassisted, at a speed exceeding 30 miles an hour on a level surface. The device must be equipped with a power drive system that functions directly or automatically only and does not require clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged.}}\n\nThe definition as written does not define the power of the motor in Watts as is conventionally done for electric bicycles, but rather in brake horsepower.  Thus for an electric bicycle, motor kit, or electric bicycle motor that is not rated by the manufacture in brake horsepower, but rather in Watts, a conversion must be made in the units a conversion which is not given in the code of the law and thus the court will have to consider a factor of conversion that is not directly encoded in the law.  Industry standard conversion for Watts to horsepower for electric motors is 1 horsepower = 746 watts.<ref>[[Horsepower]]</ref>  Acceptance of that conversion factor from industry, however, as interpretation of the law is subject to the process of the courts since it is not defined specifically in the law.\n\nIn addition the specific wording of the law may or may not prohibit the use of a \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up where the motor drives the rear wheel of the bicycle through the existing chain drive of a bicycle that has multiple gears depending on several points of interpretation of the law.  Specifically the interpretation of the wording, \"does not require clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged\".  A \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up on an electric bicycle does indeed allow the operator to change gears in the power drive system between the motor and the rear wheel of the bicycle.  Whether or not such a mechanism which allows the operator to change gears satisfies the wording that requires the operator to change gears is a matter of legal interpretation by the courts.  Just as \"shall issue\" and \"may issue\" (as in laws governing the issuing licenses) in application of the law have two different meanings (in the first case if you meet the requirements they have to give you the license and in the second they don't have to if they decide not to even if you meet the requirements for the license) whether or not \"does not require shifting\" outlaws electric bicycles where shifting is possible but is not necessarily required is a matter of interpretation. Thus the legality of electric bicycles equipped with a \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up in the U.S. state of Montana is not clearly defined.\n\n====Nebraska====\nNebraska defines a Moped as \"a bicycle with fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, an automatic transmission, and a motor with a cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters which produces no more than two brake horsepower and is capable of propelling the bicycle at a maximum design speed of no more than thirty miles per hour on level ground.\"<ref name=\"legislature1\"/>\n\nHowever, under a bill passed February 20, 2015 electric bicycles are explicitly defined.\n\n<blockquote>Bicycle shall mean (1) every device propelled solely by human power, upon which any person may ride, and having two tandem wheels either of which is more than fourteen inches in diameter or (2) a device with two or three wheels, fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, and an electric motor with a capacity not exceeding seven hundred fifty watts which produces no more than one brake horsepower and is capable of propelling the bicycle at a maximum design speed of no more than twenty miles per hour on level ground.</blockquote>\n\n====Nevada====\nAs of May 19, 2009, Nevada amended its state transportation laws to explicitly permit electric bicycles to use any \"trail or pedestrian walkway\" intended for use with bicycles and constructed with federal funding, and otherwise generally permits electric bicycles to be operated in cases where a regular bicycle could be. An electric bicycle is defined as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals with an electric motor producing up to 1 gross brake horsepower and up to 750 watts final output, and with a maximum speed of up to 20 miles per hour on flat ground with a 170-pound rider when powered only by that engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/75th2009/Bills/AB/AB441_EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=Assembly Bill No. 441 |website=Leg.state.nv.us |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n====New Jersey====\nAs of May 14, 2019, a new vehicle class (\u201cLow-speed electric bicycle\u201d) was added to NJRS Title 39, described as \u201ca two or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts, whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by a motor, while operated by a person weighing 170 pounds, is less than 20 miles per hour.\u201d \nAdditionally, the existing class of \u201cmotorized bicycles\u201d has been expanded to include\u2014in addition to gas-powered vehicles such as mopeds\u2014electric bicycles that can achieve speeds between 20&nbsp;mph and 28&nbsp;mph. For these vehicles, a driver's license and registration are still required.\n\nUnder previous regulations, all e-bikes were classified as motorized bicycles (mopeds) and required registration, but could not actually be registered since the law was written only for gas-powered vehicles. The new legislation, which applies to both \u201cpedal-assist\u201d and \u201cthrottle\u201d bicycles, removes e-bikes from that legal gray area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://njbikeped.org/new-law-legalized-e-bikes-and-e-scooters-in-new-jersey/ |title=New Law Legalizes E-Bikes and E-Scooters in New Jersey |website=NJBikePed.org |date=2019-05-15 |accessdate=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\n====New Mexico====\nNew Mexico has no specific laws concerning electric or motorized bicycles.

They may be operated on any part of a street or highway where bicycles are authorized to travel, including a bicycle lane or other portion of a roadway designated for exclusive use by bicyclists.\n\nClass 1 and 2 electric bicycles are allowed on greenways and multi-use paths unless the local government bans their use by ordinance. Class 3 bikes are banned unless the local city council passes an ordinance to allow their use.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2017, manufacturers and distributors of electric bicycles were required to apply a label that is permanently affixed, in a prominent location, to each electric bicycle, indicating its class.\n\nDriver's licenses, registration, insurance and license plate requirements do not apply.

Countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] have federal regulations governing the safety requirements and standards of manufacture. Other countries like the signatories of the [[European Union]] have agreed to wider-ranging legislation covering use and safety of their term EPAC (electric vehicles)\n\nHowever, laws and terminology are diverse.  Some countries have national regulations but leave the legality of road use for states and provinces to decide.  Municipal laws and restrictions add further complications.  Systems of classification and nomenclature also vary.  Jurisdictions may address \"power-assisted bicycle\" (Canada) or \"power-assisted cycle\" (United Kingdom) or \"electric pedal-assisted cycles\" (European Union) or simply \"electric bicycles\".  Some classify [[pedelec]]s as distinct from other bikes using electric power.  Thus, the same hardware may be subject to many different classifications and regulations.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia the e-bike is defined by the Australian Vehicle Standards as a bicycle that has an auxiliary motor with a maximum power output not exceeding 250&nbsp;W without consideration for speed limits or pedal sensors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geoff|first=Rose|title=Encouraging e-bike use \u2013 the need for regulatory reform in Australia|url=http://eng.monash.edu.au/civil/assets/document/research/centres/its/confs-workshops/archive/rose-tram.pdf|publisher=Monash University}}</ref> Each state is responsible for deciding how to treat such a vehicle and currently all states agree that such a vehicle does not require licensing or registration. Various groups are lobbying for an increase in this low limit to encourage more widespread use of e-bikes to assist in mobility, health benefits and to reduce congestion, pollution and road danger. Some states have their own rules such as no riding under electric power on bike paths and through built up areas so riders should view the state laws regarding their use. There is no licence and no registration required for e-bike usage.\n\nSince 30 May 2012, Australia has an additional new e-bike category using the [[European Union]] model of a [[pedelec]] as per the [[European Committee for Standardization|CE]] EN15194 standard. This means the e-bike can have a motor of 250W of continuous rated power which can only be activated by pedalling (if above 6&nbsp;km/h) and must cut out over 25&nbsp;km/h&nbsp;\u2013 if so it is classed as a normal bicycle.

There are two types of legal motorised bicycle. For the first type, the electric motor must not be capable of generating more than 270 watts of power. For the second type, known as a \"pedalec\", the vehicle must comply with the European Standard for Power Assisted Pedal Cycles (EN15194).\n\nThe pedals on a motorised bicycle must be the primary source of power for the vehicle. If the motor is the primary source of power then the device cannot be classed as a motorised bicycle. For example, a device where the rider can twist a throttle and complete a journey using motor power only without using the pedals, would not be classed as a motorised bicycle.\n\nMotorised bicycles can be ridden on all roads and paths, except where bicycles are specifically excluded. Riders do not need to have a driver licence to ride a motorised bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/Registration/Registering-vehicles/Wheelchairs-and-small-devices/Motorised-foot-scooters-and-motorised-bicycles.aspx |title=Bicycles, skateboards, foot scooters and similar &#124; Transport and motoring &#124; Queensland Government |publisher=Tmr.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n==Canada==\n\nEight provinces of Canada allow electric power assisted bicycles.

All require an approved helmet. Regulations may or may not require an interlock to prevent use of power when the rider is not pedaling. Some versions (e.g., if capable of operating without pedaling) of e-bikes require drivers' licenses in some provinces and have age restrictions.  Vehicle licenses and liability insurance are not required.  Generally, they are considered [[Vehicular cycling|vehicles]] (like motorcycles and pedal cycles), so are subject to the same [[Traffic|rules of the road]] as regular bicycles.  In some cases, regulatory requirements have been complicated by lobbying in respect of the [[Segway PT]].\n\nBicycles assisted by a gasoline motor or other fuel are regulated differently from e-bikes.  These are classified as motorcycles, regardless of the power output of the motor and maximum attainable speed.\n\nNote that in Canada, the term \"assist bicycle\" is the technical term for an e-bike{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and \"power-assisted bicycle\" is used in the [[List of Acts of Parliament of Canada|Canadian Federal Legislation]], but is carefully defined to only apply to electric motor assist, and specifically excludes internal combustion engines (though this is not the case in the United States).\n\n===Federal requirements===\nSince 2000, Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations (MVSR) have defined Power Assisted bicycles (PABs) as a separate category, and which require no license to operate.  PABs are currently defined as a two- or three-wheeled bicycle equipped with handlebars and operable pedals, an attached electric motor of 500W or less, and a maximum speed capability of 32&nbsp;km/h from the motor over level ground.  Other requirements include a permanently affixed label from the manufacturer in a conspicuous location stating the vehicle is a power-assisted bicycle under the statutory requirements in force at the time of manufacture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/crc-c-1038/latest/crc-c-1038.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124191729/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/crc-c-1038/latest/crc-c-1038.html |archivedate=2009-11-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/mediaroom/backgrounders/b01-R050.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217030859/http://www.tc.gc.ca/mediaroom/backgrounders/b01-R050.htm |archivedate=2005-12-17 }}</ref>  All power-assisted bicycles must utilize an electric motor for assisted propulsion.\n\nA power-assisted bicycle may be imported and exported freely within Canada without the same restrictions placed on auto-mobiles or a moped.

E-bike riders are subject to the same penalties as other cyclists for all other traffic offences.\n\n====Manitoba====\nE-bikes are legal in Manitoba, so long as certain stipulations are met.  The bike must not be designed to have more than three wheels touching the ground, the motor must stop providing motive power if the bike exceeds 32&nbsp;km/h for any reason, the motor must be smaller than 500W, it has to have functioning pedals, if it's engaged by a throttle, the motor immediately stops providing the vehicle with motive power when the driver activates a brake, and if engaged by the driver applying muscle power to the pedals, the motor immediately stops providing the vehicle with motive power when the driver stops applying muscle power.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\">[https://www.mpi.mb.ca/en/Rd-Safety/Cycling/pages/laws.aspx Article on the ''Manitoba Public Insurance'' website]</ref>  The bike must also have either a mechanism to turn the electric motor on and off that can be operated by the driver, and if the vehicle has a throttle, is separate from the throttle, or a mechanism that prevents the motor from engaging until the vehicle is traveling at 3&nbsp;km/h or more.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\"/>  You must also be at least 14 years of age to operate an E-bike.<ref name=\"mpi.mb.ca\"/>  All other Manitoba laws regarding cycling also apply.\n\n====New Brunswick====\nTo be allowed on the road it needs wheel rims larger than 9 inches, have a headlight for night, a seat at least 27 inches off the ground.\n\nNew Brunswick's Policy on Electric Motor Driven Cycles and Electric Bicycles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/services/services_renderer.200814.html |title=Motor Vehicle Registration |website=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Registrar will permit an electric motor driven cycle to be registered if it meets Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) as a Limited Speed Motorcycle, or Scooter as is done with gas powered motor driven cycles. If the vehicle was manufactured after 1988 it will bear a compliance label stating that it meets these standards. The operator will be subject to all the requirements placed on operators of motor driven cycles.\n\nIf the vehicle is able to powered by human force and has a motor 500W or less, and the motor is not capable of assisting when the vehicle is traveling at a speed greater than 32&nbsp;km/h then it can be considered a bicycle and all the requirements placed on bicyclists are applicable.\n\nIt is important to note that if a vehicle has an electric motor greater than 500 watts and is capable of powering the vehicle when traveling at a speed greater than 32&nbsp;km/h and it does not have a CMVSS compliance label it cannot be registered unless the owner can prove, by having the vehicle certified by an engineer, that it is safe for operation on NB highways. Also, not all vehicles are suitable for operation on NB highways and it could be that the vehicle in question may not be a motor driven cycle or a bicycle and cannot be operated on the highway at all.\n\nPower Assisted Bicycle Label:\n\nManufacturers of e-bikes must permanently affix a label, in a conspicuous location, stating in both official languages that the vehicle is a power-assisted bicycle as defined in the regulations under the federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Homemade e-bikes will not have this label.\n\nNOTE 1: The previous version of the policy had a section on it needing to \"look like a bike\" or a \"bike style frame\" but never defined what those were. That has been dropped and is no longer part of the new policy.\n\nNOTE 2: The top speed of the bike if propelled by human power is the posted speed limit, but the motor is only allowed to get you up to and keep you at 32&nbsp;km/hr. If the posted limit is under 32 then the posted limit is the limit allowed.\n\nNOTE 3: There is no maximum weight limit.\n\nNOTE 4: Ebikes are allowed to use cargo trailers/kid trailers.\n\nNOTE 5: There is no minimum age set.\n\nNOTE 6: DUI \u2013 If you have a DUI conviction the restrictions of the DUI override the ebike policy definition of an ebike as a bicycle and put it into the motor vehicle category.\n\n====Newfoundland====\n\n====Nova Scotia====\nIn Nova Scotia power-assisted bicycles are classified similarly to standard pedal bicycles. The Nova Scotia Motor Vehicle Act defines a power-assisted bicycle as a bicycle with an electric motor of 500 watts or less, with two wheels (one of which is at least 350&nbsp;mm) or four wheels (two of which are at least 350mm). PABs are permitted on the road in the province of Nova Scotia as long as you wear an approved bicycle helmet with the chinstrap engaged.  They do not have to meet the conditions defined within the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations for a motorcycle (they are not classed as \"motor vehicles\"), but they do have to comply with federal regulations that define Power Assisted Bicycles.\n\n====Prince Edward Island====\nAre treated as Mopeds and will need to pass inspection as a moped.\n\n====Quebec====\n\nIn [[Quebec]] power-assisted bicycles are often classified similarly to standard pedal bicycles. They do not have to meet the conditions defined within the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations (they are not classed as \"motor vehicles\"), but they do have to comply with federal regulations that define Power Assisted Bicycles. The Quebec Highway Safety Code defines a power-assisted bicycle as a bicycle(2 or 3 wheels that touch the ground) with an electric motor with a maximum power of 500W and a top speed of 32&nbsp;km/h bearing a specific compliance label permanently attached by the manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/electric-bike/|title=Riding an Electric Bike|last=SAAQ|website=SAAQ|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref>  PABs are permitted on the road in the province of Quebec, but riders have to be 14 and over to ride the electric bicycle and if they're under the age of 18, must have a moped or scooter license.\n\n====Saskatchewan====\nPower assisted bicycles are classified in two categories in [[Saskatchewan]].  An ''electric assist bicycle'' is a 2 or 3-wheeled bicycle {{sic|hide=y}} that uses pedals and a motor at the same time only.  A ''power cycle'' uses either pedals and motor or motor only.  Both must have engines with 500 watt power or less, and must not be able exceed 32&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph), i.e., electric motor cuts out at this speed or cycle is unable to go this fast on a level surface.  The power cycle has to meet the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) for a ''power-assisted bicycle''.  The power cycle requires at least a learner's driving licence (class 7), and all of the other classes 1\u20135 may operate these also.  The electric assist bicycle does not require a licence.  Helmets are required for each.  Both are treated as bicycles regarding rules of the road.  Gas powered or assisted bicycles are classified as motorcycles regardless of engine size or if using pedals plus motor.  Stickers identifying the bicycle's compliance with the Federal classification may be required for power cycles by some cities or municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.sk.ca/sgi_pub/instructional/motorcycledrivers/2009/16.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203628/http://www.sgi.sk.ca/sgi_pub/instructional/motorcycledrivers/2009/16.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n==China ==\n===Mainland===\nIn China, e-bikes currently come under the same classification as bicycles and hence don't require a driver's license to operate. Previously it was required that users registered their bike in order to be recovered if stolen, although this has recently been abolished. Due to a recent rise in electric-bicycle-related accidents, caused mostly by inexperienced riders who ride on the wrong side of the road, run red lights, don't use headlights at night etc., the Chinese government plans to change the legal status of illegal bicycles so that vehicles with an unladen weight of {{convert|20|kg|abbr=on}} or more and a top speed of {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}} or more will require a motorcycle license to operate, while vehicles lighter than {{convert|20|kg|abbr=on}} and slower than 30&nbsp;km/h can be ridden unlicensed. In the southern Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen, e-bikes, like all motorcycles, are banned from certain downtown districts. There are also bans in place in small areas of Shanghai, Hangzhou and Beijing. Bans of \"Scooter-Style Electric Bikes\" (SSEB) were however cancelled and in Shenzhen e-bikes may be seen on the streets nowadays (2010\u201311).\n\nElectric powered bicycles slower than 20&nbsp;km/h without pedaling are legally recognized as a non-mechanically operated vehicle in China.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oster |first=Shai |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703657604575005140241751852 |title=Electric Bicycles Deadly on China's Streets \u2013 WSJ |website=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\nAccording to \"TECHNOLOGY WATCH\", this should help promote its widespread use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creavis.com/files/200408_elements_e_VomMobiltelefonzumElektrofahrrad.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022857/http://www.creavis.com/files/200408_elements_e_VomMobiltelefonzumElektrofahrrad.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |format=PDF |title=From Mobile Telephony to GREEN |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-09-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Electric bicycles were banned in some areas of Beijing from August 2002 to January 2006 due to concerns over environmental, safety and city image issues.

The 2018 law is effective from January 1, 2019, and regards a bicycle permit:<ref>https://www.gov.il/he/Departments/news/20181203_ebike_license</ref>\n\nIsraeli authorities passed legislation, as of December 2009, that allows electric bicycles to be legal for street use in the country under the following criteria:\n# The maximum power of the electric engine isn't higher than 250W.\n# The electric motor is activated by the rider's pedalling effort and it has to cut out completely when the rider stops pedalling.\n# The electric motor power decreases with the advance of the bicycle speed and it must cut out completely whenever the bicycle reaches a speed of 25&nbsp;km/h.\n# The electric bicycle has to comply with the European standard&nbsp;\u2014 BSEN 15194.\n\n==Japan==\nElectric-assisted bicycles are treated as human-powered bicycles, while bicycles capable of propulsion by electric power alone face additional registration and regulatory requirements as mopeds. Requirements include electric power generation by a motor that cannot be easily modified, along with a power assist mechanism that operates safely and smoothly. In December 2008, The assist ratio was updated as follow:\n\n*Under 10&nbsp;km/h; 2\n*10\u201324&nbsp;km/h; 2-(Running speed - 10) / 7\n*Over 24&nbsp;km/h; 0\n\n''(See [[Moped#Individual countries/regions]])''\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn New Zealand, the regulations read: \"''AB (Power-assisted pedal cycle) A pedal cycle to which is attached one or more auxiliary propulsion motors having a combined maximum power output not exceeding 300 watts.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicle/classes-standards/class.html |title=Vehicle classes &#124; NZ Transport Agency |publisher=Nzta.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> This is explained by NZTA as \"''A power-assisted cycle is a cycle that has a motor of up to 300 watts.

This can cause misunderstandings with law enforcement officers who do not necessarily understand the difference, and when stopping a rider on an e-bike in a traffic stop, look at the number on the motor to determine if the e-bike is legal or not.\n\nVehicles with an electric power and power of less than 300W are classified as \"not a motor vehicle\". Such electric bicycles must comply with the same rules as bicycles. You must wear a helmet even on a scooter or bike under 300W. If the power is over 300W or a combustion engine is used it is a \"low powered vehicle\" and the moped rules apply.

Electric bicycles operated at speeds of twenty miles an hour or more, but less than twenty-five miles per hour may be registered for legal use on the roadways as mopeds, and above twenty-five miles per hour as a registered moped with an 'M' endorsement on the operator's driving license.  However, mopeds in Arizona are prohibited from using bike lanes on motor vehicle roadways.  The Arizona statute governing motorized electric bicycles does not prohibit local jurisdictions from adopting an ordinance that further regulates or prohibits the operation of motorized electric bicycles or tricycles.<ref>Under Arizona law, local jurisdictions can impose additional regulations such as lower speed limits or even prohibit usage altogether, but they cannot require state or local licensing or registration of electric bicycles or tricycles that otherwise meet the definition of a motorized bicycle or tricycle under the state statute.</ref>\n\n====Arkansas====\nArkansas does not define E-bikes.

The current regulations define an \"electric bicycle\", a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts, separated into three classes:\n{{quote|A \"class 1 electric bicycle,\" or \"low-speed pedal-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. (2) A \"class 2 electric bicycle,\" or \"low-speed throttle-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. A \"class 3 electric bicycle,\" or \"speed pedal-assisted electric bicycle,\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 miles per hour, and equipped with a speedometer. Local government ordinances are allowed to permit or ban any class of electric bicycles on dedicated bicycle paths and trails, with Class 1 & 2 permitted, and Class 3 banned, by default.}}\nBeginning January 1, 2017, manufacturers and distributors of electric bicycles will be required to apply a label that is permanently affixed, in a prominent location, to each electric bicycle, indicating its class.  Should a user \"tamper with or modify\" an electric bicycle, changing the speed capability, they must replace the label indicating the classification.\n \nDriver's licenses, registration, insurance and license plate requirements do not apply. An electric bicycle is not a motor vehicle. Drinking and driving laws apply.  Additional laws or ordinances may apply to the use of electric bicycles by each city or county.\n\n====Colorado====\nEbike definition in Colorado follows the HR 727 National Law: {{convert|20|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} e-power and {{Convert|750|W|hp|0|abbr=on}} max, 2 or 3 wheels, pedals that work. Legal low-powered ebikes are allowed on roads and bike lanes, and prohibited from using their motors on bike and pedestrian paths, unless overridden by local ordinance. The city of Boulder is the first to have done so, banning ebikes over 400W from bike lanes. Bicycles and Ebikes are disallowed on certain high speed highways and all Interstates unless signed as \"Allowed\" in certain rural Interstate stretches where the Interstate is the ONLY means of travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetsaw.com/blogs/news/89623110-are-hoverboards-legally-classified-the-same-as-electric-bicycles |title=Are Hoverboards Legally Classified the same as Electric Bicycles? |publisher=StreetSaw |date=2016-01-25 |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n====Connecticut====\nSection 14-1 of Connecticut state law classifies electric bicycles as \"motor-driven cycles\" if they have a seat height of not less than 26 inches and a motor which produces brake horsepower of 2 or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_246.htm#sec_14-1 |title=Chapter 246 \u2013 Motor Vehicles |website=Cga.ct.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}} {{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n\nMotor-driven cycles may be operated on the roadway without registration, but the operator must have a driver's license.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vehicle Highway Use |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_248.htm#sec_14-286 |title=Chapter 248 - Vehicle Highway Use |website=Cga.ct.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref> The cycle may not be operated on any sidewalk, limited access highway or turnpike.

It will be increased from a max of 500w / 20&nbsp;mph to 750w / 28&nbsp;mph (assuming the ebike in question meets class 3 criteria)\n\n====Massachusetts====\nMassachusetts General Laws define three classes of motorized two-wheeled vehicles: ''Motorcycle'', ''Motorized bicycle'', and ''Motorized scooter''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/90-1.htm |title=General Laws: CHAPTER 90, Section 1 |website=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref> Although the definition of ''motorized scooter'' includes two-wheeled vehicles propelled by electric motors with or without human power, motorized scooter specifically excludes anything which falls under the definitions of motorized bicycle and motorcycle. ''Motorized bicycle'' is a pedal bicycle which has a helper motor, or a non-pedal bicycle which has a motor, with a cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters, an automatic transmission, and which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than thirty miles per hour. ''Motorcycle'' includes any bicycle with a motor or driving wheel attached, with the exception of vehicles that fall under the specific definition of motorized bicycle. Thus, a pedal bicycle with an electric motor or a non-pedal bicycle with an electric motor, automatic transmission, and maximum speed of 30 miles an hour would fall under the definition of motorized bicycle. An electric bicycle that did not meet those restrictions would be either a motorized scooter or motorcycle, depending on specific characteristics.\n\nA motorized bicycle shall not be operated by any person under sixteen years of age, nor at a speed in excess of twenty-five miles per hour, upon any public highway, private way laid out under authority of statute, way dedicated to public use, or way under the control of park commissioners or body having like powers, within the commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/90-1B.htm |title=General Laws: CHAPTER 90, Section 1B |website=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>  A motorized bicycle shall not be operated on any way by any person not possessing a valid driver's license or learner's permit. Every person operating a motorized bicycle upon a way shall have the right to use all public ways in the commonwealth except limited access or express state highways where signs specifically prohibiting bicycles have been posted, and shall be subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the commonwealth and the regulations contained in this section, except that the motorized bicycle operator may keep to the right when passing a motor vehicle which is moving in the travel lane of the way, and the motorized bicycle operator shall signal by either hand his intention to stop or turn. Motorized bicycles may be operated on bicycle lanes adjacent to the various ways, but shall be excluded from off-street recreational bicycle paths. Every person operating a motorized bicycle or riding as a passenger on a motorized bicycle shall wear protective headgear conforming with such minimum standards of construction and performance as the registrar may prescribe, and no person operating a motorized bicycle shall permit any other person to ride a passenger on such motorized bicycle unless such passenger is wearing such protective headgear.\n\nA response to an inquiry made to the Mass DOT/RMV indicates that Massachusetts does recognize the federal low speed electric bicycle Federal Law (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2085) and interprets that to mean these ebikes do not require license or registration. However, some of the materials available on the RMV website do not distinguish between \"Motorized Bicycle\" and low power ebikes.  One form, Bicycle Conversion to Motorized Bike, does document the exemption of low power ebikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massrmv.com/rmv/forms/21897.pdf |format=PDF |title=MASSACHUSETTS REGISTRY of MOTOR VEHICLES (RMV) : BICYCLE CONVERSION to MOTORIZED BICYCLE (MOPED) : AFFIDAVIT of OWNER |website=Massrmv.com |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n====Michigan====\n(Updated May 29, 2015)\n\nIf you are a moped operator, you must follow the same traffic rules as other motor vehicle operators.  A moped is defined by law as a motor vehicle with two or three wheels that:\n\u2022Has an engine that does not exceed 100 cc piston displacement\n\u2022Does not have a gearshift\n\u2022Has a top speed of 30&nbsp;mph or less on a level surface\n\nVehicles exceeding any of the criteria above must be registered and titled as a motorcycle. Other types of vehicles, such as electric scooters, \"pocket rockets\" and mini-choppers, may fit the definition of a moped or a motorcycle, but cannot be registered by the Department of State if they lack the equipment required by law to legally drive on public roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1585_15242-236804--,00.html |title=SOS \u2013 Riding a Moped Safely |publisher=Michigan.gov |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n====Minnesota====\nElectric-assisted bicycles, also referred to as \"e-bikes,\" are a subset of bicycles that are equipped with a small attached motor.  To be classified as an \"electric-assisted bicycle\" in Minnesota, the bicycle must have a saddle and operable pedals, two or three wheels, and an electric motor of up to 1,000 watts, as well as meet certain federal motor vehicle safety standards. The motor must disengage during braking and have a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour (whether assisted by human power or not). Minn. Stat. \u00a7169.011, subd. 27.\n\nLegislative changes in 2012 significantly altered the classification and regulatory structure for e-bikes. The general effect was to establish electric-assisted bicycles as a subset of bicycles and regulate e-bikes in roughly the same manner as bicycles instead of other motorized devices with two (or three) wheels.  Laws 2012, ch. 287, art. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 15-17, 21, 23-26, 30, 32-33, and 41. The 2012 Legislature also modified and clarified regulation of e-bikes on bike paths and trails. Laws 2012, ch. 287, art. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4, 20.\n\nFollowing the 2012 change, electric-assisted bicycles are regulated similarly to other bicycles. Most of the same laws apply. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 \u00a7169.011, subd. 27; 169.222.\n\nThe bicycle does not need to be registered, and a title is no longer necessary. Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 168.012, subd. 2d;168A.03, subd. 1 clause(11)\n\nA license plate is no longer required to be displayed on the rear. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.79, subd. 3. It is not subject to motor vehicle sales tax (the general sales tax would instead be owed on e-bike purchases).\n\nA driver's license or permit is not required. Unlike a non-powered bicycle, the minimum operator age is 15 years old.  Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subd. 6a.\n\nThe device does not need to be insured.  See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.43, subds. 2, 13.\n\nElectric-assisted bicycle operators must follow the same traffic laws as operators of motor vehicles (except those that by their nature would not be relevant).  The bicycles may be operated two abreast. Operators must generally ride as close as is practical to the right-hand side of the road (exceptions include when overtaking another vehicle, preparing for a left turn, and to avoid unsafe conditions). The bicycle must be ridden within a single lane. Travel on the shoulder of a road must be in the same direction as the direction of adjacent traffic.\n\nSome prohibitions also apply, such as on: carrying cargo that prevents keeping at least one hand on the handlebars or prevents proper use of brakes, riding no more than two abreast on a roadway or shoulder, and attaching the bicycle to another vehicle. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subds. 3-5. The vehicles may be operated on a sidewalk except in a business district or when prohibited by a local unit of government, and must yield to pedestrians on the sidewalk. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.223, subd. 3.  By default, electric-assisted bicycles are allowed on road shoulders as well as on bicycle trails, bicycle paths, and bicycle lanes.\n\nA local unit of government having jurisdiction over a road or bikeway (including the Department of Natural Resources in the case of state bike trails) is authorized to restrict e-bike use if: the use is not consistent with the safety or general welfare of others; or the restriction is necessary to meet the terms of any legal agreements concerning the land on which a bikeway has been established.\n\nElectric-assisted bicycles can be parked on a sidewalk unless restricted by local government (although they cannot impede normal movement of pedestrians) and can be parked on streets where parking of other motor vehicles is allowed. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.222, subd. 9.\n\nDuring nighttime operation, the bicycle must be equipped with a front headlamp, a rear-facing red reflector, and reflectors on the front and rear of pedals, and the bicycle or rider must have reflective surfaces on each side. Minn. Stat. \u00a7169.222, subd. 6.\nAn electric-assisted bicycle can be equipped with a front-facing headlamp that emits a flashing white light, a rear-facing lamp that has a flashing red light, or both. The bicycle can carry studded tires designed for traction (such as in snowy\nor icy conditions).\n\nHelmets are no longer required for e-bike use.\n\n====Mississippi====\nIn Opinion No. 2007-00602 of the Attorney General, Jim Hood clarified that a \"bicycle with a motor attached\" does not satisfy the definition of \"motor vehicle\" under Section 63-3-103. He stated that it is up to the authority creating the bike lane to determine if a bicycle with a motor attached can be ridden in bike lanes. No specifications about the motor were made.\n\nIn Opinion No. 2011-00095 of the Attorney General, Jim Hood stated that an operator's license, helmet, safety insurance, title, registration, and safety inspection are all not required of bicycles with a motor attached.\n\n====Missouri====\nElectric bicycles appear to be considered as \"motorized bicycles\" under Missouri law.

(Montana Code 61-8-102).<ref>{{cite web |title=Montana Code Annotated 2017 |url=https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0610/chapter_0080/part_0010/section_0020/0610-0080-0010-0020.html |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\nAs of April 21, 2015, mopeds were reclassified to be treated as bicycles in Montana, not requiring a driver's license.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wadley |first1=Bill |title=Lawmakers reclassify mopeds as bicycles |url=https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/lawmakers-reclassify-mopeds-as-bicycles |website=NBC Montana |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|61-8-102.(2)(b) \"Bicycle\" means:\n\n(i) a vehicle propelled solely by human power on which any person may ride, irrespective of the number of wheels, except scooters, wheelchairs, and similar devices; or\n\n(ii) a vehicle on which a person may ride that has two tandem wheels and an electric motor capable of propelling the vehicle and a rider who weighs 170 pounds no faster than 20 miles an hour on a paved, level surface.}}\n\n{{quote|61-8-102.(2)(n) \"Moped\" means:\n\na vehicle equipped with two or three wheels, foot pedals to permit muscular propulsion, and an independent power source providing a maximum of 2 brake horsepower. The power source may not be capable of propelling the device, unassisted, at a speed exceeding 30 miles an hour on a level surface. The device must be equipped with a power drive system that functions directly or automatically only and does not require clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged.}}\n\nThe definition as written does not define the power of the motor in Watts as is conventionally done for electric bicycles, but rather in brake horsepower.  Thus for an electric bicycle, motor kit, or electric bicycle motor that is not rated by the manufacture in brake horsepower, but rather in Watts, a conversion must be made in the units a conversion which is not given in the code of the law and thus the court will have to consider a factor of conversion that is not directly encoded in the law.  Industry standard conversion for Watts to horsepower for electric motors is 1 horsepower = 746 watts.<ref>[[Horsepower]]</ref>  Acceptance of that conversion factor from industry, however, as interpretation of the law is subject to the process of the courts since it is not defined specifically in the law.\n\nIn addition the specific wording of the law may or may not prohibit the use of a \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up where the motor drives the rear wheel of the bicycle through the existing chain drive of a bicycle that has multiple gears depending on several points of interpretation of the law.  Specifically the interpretation of the wording, \"does not require clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged\".  A \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up on an electric bicycle does indeed allow the operator to change gears in the power drive system between the motor and the rear wheel of the bicycle.  Whether or not such a mechanism which allows the operator to change gears satisfies the wording that requires the operator to change gears is a matter of legal interpretation by the courts.  Just as \"shall issue\" and \"may issue\" (as in laws governing the issuing licenses) in application of the law have two different meanings (in the first case if you meet the requirements they have to give you the license and in the second they don't have to if they decide not to even if you meet the requirements for the license) whether or not \"does not require shifting\" outlaws electric bicycles where shifting is possible but is not necessarily required is a matter of interpretation. Thus the legality of electric bicycles equipped with a \"mid-drive\" or \"crank-drive\" motor set-up in the U.S. state of Montana is not clearly defined.\n\n====Nebraska====\nNebraska defines a Moped as \"a bicycle with fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, an automatic transmission, and a motor with a cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters which produces no more than two brake horsepower and is capable of propelling the bicycle at a maximum design speed of no more than thirty miles per hour on level ground.\"<ref name=\"legislature1\"/>\n\nHowever, under a bill passed February 20, 2015 electric bicycles are explicitly defined.\n\n<blockquote>Bicycle shall mean (1) every device propelled solely by human power, upon which any person may ride, and having two tandem wheels either of which is more than fourteen inches in diameter or (2) a device with two or three wheels, fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, and an electric motor with a capacity not exceeding seven hundred fifty watts which produces no more than one brake horsepower and is capable of propelling the bicycle at a maximum design speed of no more than twenty miles per hour on level ground.</blockquote>\n\n====Nevada====\nAs of May 19, 2009, Nevada amended its state transportation laws to explicitly permit electric bicycles to use any \"trail or pedestrian walkway\" intended for use with bicycles and constructed with federal funding, and otherwise generally permits electric bicycles to be operated in cases where a regular bicycle could be. An electric bicycle is defined as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals with an electric motor producing up to 1 gross brake horsepower and up to 750 watts final output, and with a maximum speed of up to 20 miles per hour on flat ground with a 170-pound rider when powered only by that engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/75th2009/Bills/AB/AB441_EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=Assembly Bill No. 441 |website=Leg.state.nv.us |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n====New Jersey====\nAs of May 14, 2019, a new vehicle class (\u201cLow-speed electric bicycle\u201d) was added to NJRS Title 39, described as \u201ca two or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts, whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by a motor, while operated by a person weighing 170 pounds, is less than 20 miles per hour.\u201d \nAdditionally, the existing class of \u201cmotorized bicycles\u201d has been expanded to include\u2014in addition to gas-powered vehicles such as mopeds\u2014electric bicycles that can achieve speeds between 20&nbsp;mph and 28&nbsp;mph. For these vehicles, a driver's license and registration are still required.\n\nUnder previous regulations, all e-bikes were classified as motorized bicycles (mopeds) and required registration, but could not actually be registered since the law was written only for gas-powered vehicles. The new legislation, which applies to both \u201cpedal-assist\u201d and \u201cthrottle\u201d bicycles, removes e-bikes from that legal gray area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://njbikeped.org/new-law-legalized-e-bikes-and-e-scooters-in-new-jersey/ |title=New Law Legalizes E-Bikes and E-Scooters in New Jersey |website=NJBikePed.org |date=2019-05-15 |accessdate=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\n====New Mexico====\nNew Mexico has no specific laws concerning electric or motorized bicycles.

Wear a properly fitted and fastened bicycle helmet which meets the standards of the American National Standards Institute or the Snell Memorial Foundation Standards for protective headgear for use in bicycling, provided such operator is eighteen (18) years of age or less.\n\n====Oregon====\nOregon Law (ORS 801.258]) defines an electric assisted bicycle as an electric motor-driven vehicle equipped with operable pedals, a seat or saddle for the rider, no more than three wheels in contact during travel. In addition, the vehicle must be equipped with an electric motor that is capable of applying a power output of no greater than 1,000 watts, and that is incapable of propelling the vehicle at a speed greater than 20 miles per hour on level ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/vehicle/pocketbike_factsheet.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022115947/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/vehicle/pocketbike_factsheet.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn general, electric bicycles are considered \"bicycles\", rather than motor vehicles, for purposes of the code.

The requirement of an automatic transmission is troublesome for those who just want to add an electric-assist motor to a bicycle, for almost all bicycles have transmissions consisting of chains and manually shifted sprockets.  The registration form asks for a [[VIN]], making it difficult to register some foreign-made ebikes.  The fine for riding an unregistered electric bike is approximately $160.00 per event as of 2007.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, SB997 was introduced by Senator Matt Smith, which seeks to amend PA Vehicle Code to include \"Pedalcycle with Electric Assist\". In a memo addressed to all senate members, Smith said the definition shall include \"bicycles equipped with an electric motor not exceeding 750 watts, weighing not more than 100 pounds, are capable of a maximum speed of not more than 20 mph, and have operable pedals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20130&cosponId=11743 |title=Senate Co-Sponsorship Memoranda - PA State Senate |website=Legis.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2013&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0997&pn=1177 |format=PDF |title=Senate Bill No. 997 |website=Legis.state.pa.us |accessdate=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2014 PA house bill 573 passed into law, which is Act 154, which changes the definition of \"pedalcycle\" (bicycle) in the PA state vehicle code. \"Pedalcycle\" is now defined as a vehicle propelled solely by human-powered pedals or a \"pedalcycle\" (bicycle) with electric assist( a vehicle weighing not more than 100 pounds with two or three wheels more than 11 inches in diameter, manufactured or assembled with an electric motor rated no more than 750 watts and equipped with operational pedals and travels at speeds less than 20&nbsp;mph).

They may be operated on any part of a street or highway where bicycles are authorized to travel, including a bicycle lane or other portion of a roadway designated for exclusive use by bicyclists.\n\nClass 1 and 2 electric bicycles are allowed on greenways and multi-use paths unless the local government bans their use by ordinance. Class 3 bikes are banned unless the local city council passes an ordinance to allow their use.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2017, manufacturers and distributors of electric bicycles were required to apply a label that is permanently affixed, in a prominent location, to each electric bicycle, indicating its class.\n\nDriver's licenses, registration, insurance and license plate requirements do not apply. An electric bicycle is not a motor vehicle. Drinking and driving laws apply. Additional laws or ordinances may apply to the use of electric bicycles by each city or county.\n\n==== Texas ====\n\"Bicycles\" and \"Electric Bicycles\" are legally defined in the Texas Transportation Code Title 7, Chapter 551 entitled \"Operation of Bicycles, Mopeds, and Play Vehicles\" in Subchapter A, B, C, and D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/TN/content/pdf/tn.007.00.000551.00.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602180623/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/TN/content/pdf/tn.007.00.000551.00.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-02 |format=PDF |title=CHAPTER 551.
