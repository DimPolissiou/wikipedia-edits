Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere.

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Composition ==\n''Lohengrin'' was written and composed between 1845-1848 when Wagner worked as Kappelmeister at the Royal Dresden court. The opera's genesis however starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]]. The book in question was Ludwig Bechstein's 1835 anthology of legends ''Der Sagenchatz und die Sagenkreise des Th\u00fcringerlandes''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spencer |first1=Stewart |editor1-last=Grey |editor1-first=Thomas S. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Wagner |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-64439-6 |page=70 |chapter=Part II: Opera, music, drama - 4.

Lucas]]'s critical study of the \"Wartburg war\" but also included a piece of criticism about the poem ''Lohengrin'', together with a lengthy narrative of the rambling epic's principal content.

The \"Romantic operas\" and the turn to myth}}</ref> It would be nearly four years before Wagner's image of Lohengrin would again manifest itself to his creative imagination.\n\nWriting retrospectively in his compulsively readable 1865 biography (even if its royal patronage diminishes its reliability), Wagner tells the story of how ''Lohengrin'''s libretto's was written. In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English Tr. Andrew Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd |location=London |page=124 |language=English Tr. Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves, one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-drafts of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd |location=London |pages=129-132 |language=English Tr. Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English Tr.

To this end Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III,\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954</ref> Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor [[Karl Beck (tenor)|Karl Beck]],<ref>Wagner had written the act 3 tenor monologue ''In fernem Land'' (the \"Grail Narration\") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Karl Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only the first part of the Narration.(see [http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf Peter Bassett, \"An Introduction to Wagner's ''Lohengrin'': A paper given to the Patrons and Friends of Opera Australia\", Sydney 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080312/http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }}) In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] was by [[Franz V\u00f6lker]] during the lavish 1936 production, which [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan.

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English Tr.

The opera's genesis however starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]].

In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English Tr. Andrew Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves, one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-drafts of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref> Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> Wagner confesses that Franck's concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin's involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III,\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18th June and complete on 2nd August 1847. Wagner announced that he had completed the Lohengrin opera in a letter to Ferdinand Heine dated 6 August 1847:\n\n<blockquote>I feel pleased and happy as a result, since I am well satisfied with what I have done.</blockquote>\n\nWagner's outlines to Heine that his plan was to build on a success in Berlin with the premiere there of Rienzi on 24 October 1847 with a follow up performance of Lohengrin.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\n\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is stricken with grief and falls to the ground dead.<ref>Plot taken from ''The Opera Goer's Complete Guide'' by Leo Melitz, 1921 version.</ref>\n\n==Notable arias and excerpts==\n*Act 1\n**[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]\n**\"{{Lang|de|Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tage|italic=no}}\" (Elsa's Narrative)\n**Scene \"{{Lang|de|Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege|italic=no}}\"\n* Act 2\n**\"{{Lang|de|Durch dich musst' ich verlieren|italic=no}}\" (Telramund)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Euch l\u00fcften, die mein Klagen|italic=no}}\" (Elsa)\n**Scene 4 opening, \"Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral\"\n* Act 3\n**Prelude\n**[[Bridal Chorus]] \"{{Lang|de|Treulich gef\u00fchrt|italic=no}}\"\n**\"{{Lang|de|Das s\u00fcsse Lied verhallt|italic=no}}\" (Love duet)\n**\"{{Lang|de|H\u00f6chstes Vertrau'n|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Declaration to Elsa)\n**Entry of King Henry\n**\"{{Lang|de|In fernem Land|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Narration)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Mein lieber Schwan...
