It was a [[liquid-propellant rocket]] using [[RP-1]] fuel and [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]] oxidizer, with a single [[Rocketdyne S-3D| Rocketdyne LR79-NA]] (model S-3D) [[rocket engine]] producing 667&nbsp;kN of thrust. It was armed with the 1.44&nbsp;megaton [[W49]] nuclear warhead. The prime contractor was the [[Chrysler Corporation]].\n\nThe Jupiter was originally designed by the [[US Army]], which was looking for a highly accurate missile designed to strike high-value targets like bridges, railway yards, troop concentrations and the like. The [[US Navy]] also expressed an interest in the design as an [[SLBM]] but left the collaboration to work on their [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]]. Jupiter retained the short, squat shape intended to fit in naval submarines.\n\n==Development history==\n\n===Initial concept===\nJupiter traces its history ultimately to the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] missile, the US's first nuclear ballistic missile. While it was entering service, [[Wernher von Braun]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] team at [[Redstone Arsenal]] began to consider an upgraded version using the LR89 rocket engine being developed by [[Rocketdyne]] for the Air Force's [[Atlas missile]] project. Using the LR89 and adding a second stage would allow the new design to reach {{convert|1000|nmi}},{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}} a dramatic improvement over the Redstone's roughly {{convert|60|miles}}.\n\nAs Rocketdyne continued working on the LR89, it appeared that it could be improved to increase thrust over the promised {{convert|120000|lbf}}. In 1954, the Army asked Rocketdyne to provide a similar design with a thrust of {{convert|135000|lbf}}.{{sfn|Healy|1958|p=1}} During this same period, the weight of nuclear warheads was rapidly falling, and by combining this engine with a warhead of {{convert|2000|lbs}} they could build a single-stage missile able to reach {{convert|1500|nmi}} while being significantly less complicated and easier to handle in the field than a two-stage model. This engine was continually upgraded, ultimately reaching {{convert|150000|lbf}}.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}} This last model, known to the Army as the NAA-150-200, became much better known by its Rocketdyne model number, S-3.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=The Design}}\n\n===Navy SLBM interest===\n[[File:Arleigh Burke 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Arleigh Burke is credited with breaking the Navy out of its moribund ways, and pressing for development of the SLBM.]]\n\nAround the same time, the [[US Navy]] was looking for ways to join the nuclear club, and had been focusing mostly on [[cruise missile]]s and similar systems. Some consideration had been given to the use of ballistic missiles on ships, but Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]], \"father\" of the nuclear submarine, was skeptical that this could be done, and was worried it would take up funding needed elsewhere.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=135}} Another skeptic of missiles was the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Robert B. Carney]].{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\nLower-ranking Navy officials became increasingly interested when the Army and Air Force began serious development of their long-range missiles. In an attempt to bypass high-ranking Navy officials, who remained uninterested in the concept, the Navy liaison to the [[Killian Committee]] championed the cause. The Committee took up the concept, and in September 1955 released a report calling for the development of a sea-based missile system.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\nThe Navy's disinterest in missiles had been greatly reduced with the August 1955 appointment of Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] to replace Carney. Burke was convinced the Navy had to get into the missile field as rapidly as possible, and was well aware that the Air Force would oppose any such endeavor. Instead, he approached the Army, and found that the proposed Jupiter fit the range goals needed by the Navy.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\n===Development begins===\nThe issue of who would be given the go-ahead to build an IRBM by this time had reached the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS), who proved unable to reach a decision. This forced the Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] to move ahead without an official recommendation from the military. He saw the Navy interest as a reasonable argument to continue the Army project in any event, and on 8 November 1955 approved both programs. The Air Force would develop IRBM No. 1, or SM-75 (for \"strategic missile\"), the Army would develop their design as IRBM No. 2 or SM-78. The Navy would develop systems to launch the Army missile from ships and, later, submarines.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}{{sfn|Neufeld|1990|p=121}}\n\nThe requirement for shipboard storage and launching dictated the size and shape of the Jupiter. The original Army design was {{convert|92|feet}} long and {{convert|95|inch}} in diameter. The Navy stated they were not interested in anything longer than {{convert|50|feet}}. The ABMA team responded by increasing the diameter to {{convert|105|inch}}. This precluded it from being carried aboard contemporary [[cargo aircraft]], limiting it to sea and road. Even with this change, they were unable to reduce its length enough to suit the Navy. They suggested that they begin with a {{convert|60|foot}} long version and then scale it down as improvements in the engines were worked into the design. This was rejected, and after briefly considering a {{convert|55|foot}} version, finally settled on the {{convert|58|foot}} version.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Defining the Army/Navy Jupiter}}\n\nOn 2 December 1955, the secretaries of the Army and Navy publicly announced the dual Army\u2013Navy program to create a land- and sea-based MRBM. In April 1956, as part of a widespread effort to assign names to various missile projects, the Army's effort was given the name \"Jupiter\" and the Air Force's became \"Thor\".{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}}\n\n===Accuracy and mission===\nRedstone provided an accuracy of {{convert|300|m}} at its maximum range, which, when combined with its large warhead, allowed it to attack hard targets like protected airbases, bridges, command and control sites, as well as other strategic targets like railway marshaling yards and pre-attack concentration areas. This was in keeping with the Army's view of nuclear weapons, which was in effect more powerful [[artillery]]. They saw the weapons as part of a large-scale battle in Europe, in which both sides would use nuclear weapons during a limited war that did not include the use of strategic weapons on each other's cities. In that case, \"if wars were to be kept limited, such weapons would have to be capable of hitting only tactical targets.\" This approach saw the support of a number of influential theorists, notably [[Henry Kissinger]], and was seized on as a uniquely Army mission.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=132}}\n\nThe original goal for the new longer-range design was to match Redstone's accuracy at the Jupiter's much-extended range. That is, if Redstone could reach 300&nbsp;m at 60&nbsp;miles, the new design would provide a [[circular error probable]] on the order of {{convert|7|km}}. As development continued, it became clear the ABMA team, under the direction of [[Fritz Mueller]], could improve on that. This led to a period in which \"The Army would lay down a particular accuracy, and wait for our arguments whether it was possible. We had to promise a lot, but were fortunate.\"{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nThis process ultimately delivered a design intended to provide {{convert|0.5|mile}} accuracy at the full range, an order of magnitude better than Redstone and four times better than the best INS designs being used by the Air Force. The system was so accurate that a number of observers expressed their skepticism about the Army's goals, with the [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group|WSEG]] suggesting they were hopelessly optimistic.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe Air Force was dead set against Jupiter. They argued that nuclear weapons were not simple new artillery, and that their employment would immediately trigger a response that might result in a strategic exchange. This would especially be true if the Army launched a long-range weapon like Jupiter, which could reach cities in the Soviet Union and could not immediately be distinguished as attacking a military or civilian target. They suggested that any such launch would trigger a strategic response, and as such, the Army should not be given any long-range weapons.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nHowever, as von Braun's team went from success to success, and with Atlas still years from operational deployment, it was clear that Jupiter represented a threat to the Air Force's desired hegemony over strategic forces. This led to them starting their own MRBM program [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]], in spite of having repeatedly dismissed the medium-range role in the past.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p= 120}} The fighting between the Army and Air Force grew through 1955 and 1956 until practically every missile system the Army was involved in was being attacked in the press.<ref>{{cite news |title=Air Force Calls Army Unfit to Guard Nation |newspaper=New York Times |date=21 May 1956 |p=1}}</ref>\n\n===Navy exit===\n[[File:Polaris-a3.jpg|thumb|right|The Navy's Polaris had range similar to Jupiter.]]\n\nThe Navy was concerned from the start about Jupiter's [[cryogenic propellant]]s, but at the time there was no other option. Given the size and weight of contemporary nuclear weapons, only a large liquid-fuel rocket engine provided the energy needed to meet the Navy's range goal of launching from safe areas in the Atlantic Ocean. They justified the risk thus:\n\n{{cquote|We were prepared to take the chance that we might lose a submarine or two through accidental explosions. But, then, there are some of us who enjoy, or at lease &#91;sic&#93; are acclimated to, the idea of risking our lives.\"{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=137}}}}\n\nAll of this changed radically in the summer of 1956, when [[Project Nobska]] brought together leading scientists to consider antisubmarine warfare. As part of this workshop, [[Edward Teller]] stated that by 1963 a 1&nbsp;megaton warhead would be reduced to only {{convert|600|lbs}}.<ref>{{cite book |first=Elliot |last=Converse III |title= Rearming for the Cold War 1945 \u2013 1960 |url=http://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/acquisition_pub/OSDHO-Acquisition-Series-Vol1.pdf |page=527 |publisher= Government Printing Office |date= 2012}}</ref> Rocketry experts at the same meeting suggested that an intermediate-range weapon carrying one of these weapons could be built using [[solid propellant]]. Even in this case, the missile would be much smaller than Jupiter; Jupiter was expected to weigh {{convert|160000|lb}}, while estimates of a solid-fuel missile with similar range were closer to {{convert|30000|lb}}, along with a similar reduction in size which was of paramount importance to a submarine design.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=138}}\n\nThe Navy announced their desire to develop their own missile that summer, initially under the name Jupiter-S. After intensive follow-up studies, the Navy withdrew from the Jupiter program in December 1956. This was officially announced by the Army in January 1957.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.redstone.army.mil/ihist-1957.html |title=Installation history, 1957 |website=US Army Redstone Arsenal History}}</ref> In its place, the Navy began development of what was then known as the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program, and the missile was later renamed [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]], their first [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM). Rickover, one of the few remaining skeptics, was won over by pointing out that a properly designed submarine was needed specifically for this role, and he would be called upon to produce it. Rickover was from that point on a staunch ally of the program.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=139}}\n\n===Saved from cancellation===\n[[File:McElroy at ABMA.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary of Defence Neil McElroy visits the Jupiter prototype assembly line at ABMA.

The US was aware of these efforts and had already talked to the press about it, suggesting that if the Soviets launched a satellite first it would be no big deal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1958-11/Galaxy_1958_11#page/n47/mode/2up | title=How Secret was Sputnik No. 1? | work=Galaxy | date=November 1958 | accessdate=13 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | pages=48\u201350}}</ref> To their surprise, the press exploded in rage over the affair. Having spent over a decade working on similar missiles, like [[Atlas ICBM|Atlas]], the fact that the Soviets could beat them was a serious blow, and prompted a deep review of the ongoing programs.<ref>{{cite news|last=David |first=Leonard |title=Sputnik 1: The Satellite That Started It All |work=Space.com |date=4 October 2002 |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sputnik_45th_anniversary_021004.html |accessdate=20 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216013800/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sputnik_45th_anniversary_021004.html |archivedate=16 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOne problem noted from the start was that the internecine fighting between the Army and Air Force was leading to significant duplication of effort, with little to show for it. The Department of Defense responded by creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA|ARPA]]), whose initial mission was to look over all of the ongoing projects and select ones based solely on their technical merits.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Air Force Gains Control}}\n\nAt the same time, the fighting had begun to have negative political effects. In a 26 November 1956 memorandum, recently appointed [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] attempted to end the fighting. His solution was to limit the Army to weapons with {{convert|200|mi|adj=on}} range, and those involved in surface-to-air defense to only {{convert|100|mi}}.<ref name=larsen>{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Larsen |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&dat=19570801&id=DuIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=x4oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7135,197246 |accessdate=18 May 2013 |title=New Battle Looms Over Army's Newest Missile |newspaper=Sarasota Journal |date=1 August 1957 |page=35}}</ref> The memo also placed limits on Army air operations, severely limiting the weight of the aircraft it was allowed to operate.

However, ARPA's studies clearly showed it was an excellent system, and as it was ready to enter production, any Air Force thoughts about canceling it were immediately quashed. New orders for 32 prototypes and 62 operational missiles were soon placed, bringing the total number of Jupiters to be built to 94. The first, hand-built at ABMA, would be delivered by the end of FY57, and the first production models from Chrysler's Michigan Ordnance Missile Plant near [[Warren, Michigan]] between FY58 and FY61.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Air Force Gains Control}}\n\n===Lingering complaints===\nA primary complaint about Jupiter was that the design's shorter range placed it within relatively easy striking distance of Soviet weapons, both missiles and aircraft. Thor, based in the UK, would likely have more warning of an impending attack.{{efn|The Army noted that an overwater approach to the UK meant that Thor had little warning at all.}} This is precisely the reason that the Army spent considerable effort on making Jupiter mobile, in order to make surprise attacks difficult without prior [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nHowever, in November 1958, the Air Force decided Jupiter would be launched from fixed emplacements. Army General [[Maxwell Taylor]] argued this was done deliberately, noting that:\n\n{{cquote|...a mobile missile needs Army-type troops to move, emplace, protect and fire it... a decision to organize mobile ballistic missile units would in logic have led to transferring the operational use of the weapon back to the Army \u2013 where it should have been all the time.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}}}\n\nTo offset the possibility of air attack, the systems were upgraded to allow a launch within 15 minutes of a launch order.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc= Air Force Gains Control}}\n\n==Testing history==\nRocketdyne tested the first S-3 engine at their Santa Susana, California facilities in November 1955. A mock-up was delivered to ABMA in January 1956, followed by the first prototype engines in July 1956. Testing of these engines began in September 1956 at ABMA's new Power Plant Test Stand. This demonstrated a number of problems with unstable combustion, leading to the failure of four engines by November. To continue testing, the engine was temporarily derated back to 135,000&nbsp;lbf and was successfully tested at this level in January 1957. Continued work on the engine developed several sub-versions, finally reaching the design goal of 150,000&nbsp;lbf in the S-3D model.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Testing Jupiter, Propulsion}}\n\nThe 135,000 pound engine, also used in the first Thor and Atlas tests, had conical thrust chambers, but the 150,000 pound model switched to bell-shaped thrust chambers. Unlike Thor and Atlas, which had two small vernier engines for roll control, Jupiter gimbaled the turbine exhaust. The early test model Jupiters had two small gas jets powered off the turbine exhaust, the gimbaled exhaust pipe not being introduced until late 1958.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Static tests===\nIn 1954 Test Laboratory director Karl Heimburg began construction of the Static Test Stand for Redstone testing. This was still under construction when it was re-purposed for Jupiter, and finally completed in January 1957.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Testing Jupiter, Static Test}} A Jupiter was installed in the stand that month, and fired for the first time on 12 February 1957. This almost ended in disaster when a small explosion went off in the [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) pump, and as the missile sat there the LOX boiled off and threatened to burst the tanks. The day was saved when the foreman, Paul Kennedy, ran to the missile and connected a pressure line to drain the oxygen buildup in the tank. The problem was later traced to the lubricant used in the pump, which tended to burst into flames in contact with LOX. A new lubricant was introduced, along with a series of changes to the test stand to help retain control in these situations.<ref>{{cite web |first=Harry |last=Johnstone |title=The Life and Times of Harry M.

Redstone testing moved to these pads from the smaller LC-4 on 20 April 1955, with the launch of the seventh Redstone from LC-6. Envisioning an extended test program, a second set of similar pads began construction in 1956, LC-26 A and B; the only major difference was the blockhouse was located slightly further away, about {{convert|400|feet}}. In late 1957 a set of parallel railway tracks running just east of the pads was added, allowing an A-frame gantry to be rolled to any of the four pads.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=The Cape}}\n\nJupiters were delivered to the Cape strapped to wheeled trailers and flown to the Cape's \"Skid Strip\" on C-124s. They were then moved to Hangar R at the Cape Industrial Area where the nose cone was mated with the missile, and electrical checkout was performed. It was then moved on the trailer to the pads, about {{convert|3.5|miles}} south, where they were lifted to vertical by a crane on the movable gantry. Just to the north of the launch area was the Air Force's LC-17 for Thor, and LC-18 used for Thor and the Navy's [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]]. After the Army's head start, the Air Force had since caught up and attempted its first Thor launch on 26 January 1957, which ended with the missile exploding on the launch pad.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nJupiter test flights commenced with the launch of AM-1A (ABMA Missile 1A) on 1 March 1957 from LC-5. This missile was equipped with the lower-thrust interim engine. The vehicle performed well until past 50 seconds into launch when control started to fail, leading to breakup at T+73 seconds. It was deduced that turbopump exhaust was sucked up by the partial vacuum in the area behind the missile and began to burn in the tail section. The heat burned through the control wiring, so extra insulation was added there on future flights. An identical AM-1B was quickly readied and launched on 26 April. AM-1B's flight went entirely according to plan up to T+70 seconds when the missile started becoming unstable in flight and finally broke up at T+93 seconds. The failure was deduced to have been the result of propellant slosh due to bending modes induced by the steering maneuvers needed to perform the flight trajectory. The solution to this problem involved testing several types of baffles in a Jupiter center section until discovering a suitable type for both the LOX and fuel tanks.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nThe third Jupiter, also numbered AM-1, was quickly equipped with the baffles and launched on May 31, slightly over a month after AM-1B, traveling a full {{convert|1247|nmi}} downrange. This version had a slightly improved S-3 engine with {{convert|139000|lbf}} thrust. AM-2 flew from LC-26A on 28 August, and successfully tested the separation of the rocket body from the reentry vehicle section before splashing down at {{convert|1460|nmi}}. AM-3 flew from LC-26B on 23 October, including the ablative heat shield and the new ST-90 INS. This test flew a planned distance of {{convert|1100|nmi}}.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAM-3A launched on November 26 and all went according to plan until T+101 seconds when engine thrust abruptly terminated. The missile broke up at T+232 seconds. On December 18, AM-4 lost thrust T+117 seconds and fell into the ocean {{convert|149|nmi}} downrange. These failures were traced to an inadequate turbopump design that resulted in a string of failures in the Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas programs, all of which used a variant of the same Rocketdyne engine. Testing then paused for five months while Rocketdyne came up with a number of fixes and the Army retrofitted all its Jupiters with the redesigned pumps.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}} In spite of these failures, Jupiter was declared operational on 15 January 1958.\n\nTaking the time to also fully rate the engine to 150,000&nbsp;lbf, the new engine was first flown on AM-5 on 18 May 1958 from LC-26B, reaching a planned {{convert|1247|nmi}}. AM-5 also carried the real nose cone design, which separated from the rocket body, spun up the warhead, and separated to allow the warhead to continue on its own. The warhead section was equipped with a parachute and was recovered by the Navy some {{convert|28|nmi}} from its predicted splashdown point.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAM-6B included both the production nose cone and the ST-90 INS during its launch from LC-26B on 17 July 1958. This time the Navy recovered it only {{convert|1.5|nmi}} from its planned splash down point {{convert|1241|nmi}} downrange. AM-7 flew {{convert|1207|nmi}} on 27 August, testing a new solid fuel rocket for spinup, replacing the older hydrogen peroxide model. AM-9 was launched on 10 October, the first Jupiter to carry the fully functional turbine exhaust roll control system. The flight failed however; a pinhole leak in the thrust transducer area started a thrust section fire and loss of vehicle control. The Range Safety Officer destroyed the missile at T+49 seconds. {{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAfterwards, there was only one more failure in the Jupiter program, AM-23 on 15 September 1959, which developed a leak in a nitrogen bottle that led to depressurization of the RP-1 tank and almost immediate loss of control at liftoff. The missile wobbled from side to side and the RP-1 tank began to break apart starting at T+7 seconds. The Jupiter flipped upside down, dumping out the contents of the RP-1 tank, followed by total vehicle breakup at T+13 seconds, just before the Range Safety Officer could issue the flight termination command. Flying debris struck and damaged a Juno II on the adjacent LC-5. This particular launch was carrying a biological nose cone with mice and other specimens (which did not survive).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jupiter.htm |title=Jupiter |website=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |accessdate=26 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010114842/http://astronautix.com/lvs/jupiter.htm |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThrough the early 1960s, a number of Jupiters were launched by the forces of other countries, as well as the Air Force, as part of ongoing combat training.

Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]], the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] notified the Air Force it had tentatively planned to deploy the first three Jupiter squadrons (45 missiles) in France. However, in June 1958 the new French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] refused to accept basing any Jupiter missiles in France. This prompted U.S. to explore the possibility of deploying the missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Air Force was already implementing plans to base four squadrons (60 missiles)\u2014subsequently redefined as 20 [[Royal Air Force]] squadrons each with three missiles\u2014of [[PGM-17 Thor]] IRBMs in Britain on airfields stretching from [[Yorkshire]] to [[East Anglia]].\n\nIn 1958, the United States Air Force activated the [[864th Strategic Missile Squadron]] at ABMA. Although the USAF briefly considered training its Jupiter crews at [[Vandenberg AFB]], California, it later decided to conduct all of its training at [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. In June and September of the same year the Air Force activated two more squadrons, the 865th and 866th.\n\nIn April 1959, the secretary of the Air Force issued implementing instructions to USAF to deploy two Jupiter squadrons to Italy. The two squadrons, totaling 30 missiles, were deployed at 10 sites in Italy from 1961 to 1963. They were operated by [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana|Italian Air Force]] crews, but USAF personnel controlled arming the nuclear warheads. The deployed missiles were under command of [[36th Air Brigade (Italy)|36th Strategic Interdiction Air Brigade]] (''36\u00aa Aerobrigata Interdizione Strategica'', Italian Air Force) at [[Gioia del Colle Air Base]], Italy.\n\nIn October 1959, the location of the third and final Jupiter MRBM squadron was settled when a government-to-government agreement was signed with Turkey. The U.S. and Turkey concluded an agreement to deploy one Jupiter squadron on NATO's southern flank. One squadron totaling 15 missiles was deployed at five sites near [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey from 1961 to 1963, operated by USAF personnel, with the first flight of three Jupiter missiles turned over to the T\u00fcrk Hava Kuvvetleri (Turkish Air Force) in late October 1962, but USAF personnel retaining control of nuclear warhead arming.\n\nOn four occasions between mid-October 1961 and August 1962, Jupiter mobile missiles carrying 1.4 megatons of TNT (5.9 PJ) nuclear warheads were struck by lightning at their bases in Italy. In each case, thermal batteries were activated, and on two occasions, tritium-deuterium [[Boosted fission weapon|\"boost\" gas]] was injected into the warhead pits, partially arming them. After the fourth lightning strike on a Jupiter MRBM, the USAF placed protective lightning strike-diversion tower arrays at all of the Italian and Turkish Jupiter MRBM missiles sites.\n\nIn 1962, a Bulgarian [[MiG-17]] reconnaissance airplane was reported to have crashed into an olive grove near one of the U.S. Jupiter missile launch sites in Italy, after overflying the site.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lednicer |first=David|title=Intrusions, Overflights, Shootdowns and Defections During the Cold War and Thereafter|url=http://mysite.ncnetwork.net/res12e522/ColdWar.html|website=Aviation History Pages|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=9 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the Turkish Jupiters had been installed, the missiles were already largely obsolete and increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attacks.

To reduce vulnerability, the flights were located approximately 30 miles apart, with the triple launcher emplacements separated by a distance of several hundred miles.\n\nThe ground equipment for each emplacement was housed in approximately 20 vehicles; including two generator trucks, a power distribution truck, short- and long-range [[theodolite]]s, a hydraulic and pneumatic truck and a liquid oxygen truck. Another trailer carried 6000 gallons of fuel and three liquid oxygen trailers each carried {{convert|4000|gal}}.\n\nThe missiles arrived at the emplacement on large trailers; while still on the trailer, the crew attached the hinged launch pedestal to the base of the missile which was hauled to an upright position using a winch. Once the missile was vertical, fuel and oxidizer lines were connected and the bottom third of the missile was encased in a \"flower petal shelter\", consisting of wedge-shaped metal panels, allowing crew members to service the missiles in all weather conditions. Stored empty, on 15-minute combat status in an upright position on the launch pad, the firing sequence included filling the fuel and oxidizer tanks with {{convert|68000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of LOX and {{convert|30000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of RP-1, while the guidance system was aligned and targeting information loaded. Once the fuel and oxidizer tanks were full, the launch controlling officer and two crewmen in a mobile launch control trailer could launch the missiles.\n\nEach squadron was supported by a receipt, inspection and maintenance (RIM) area to the rear of the emplacements. RIM teams inspected new missiles and provided maintenance and repair to missiles in the field. Each RIM area also housed 25 tons of liquid oxygen and nitrogen generating plants. Several times a week, tanker trucks carried the fuel from the plant to the individual emplacements.\n\n==Specifications (Jupiter MRBM)==\n* Length: 60&nbsp;ft (18.3 m)\n* Diameter: 8&nbsp;ft 9 in (2.67 m)\n* Total Fueled Weight: 108,804&nbsp;lb (49,353&nbsp;kg)\n* Empty Weight: 13,715&nbsp;lb (6,221&nbsp;kg)\n* Oxygen (LOX) Weight: 68,760&nbsp;lb (31,189&nbsp;kg)\n* RP-1 (kerosene) Weight: 30,415&nbsp;lb (13,796&nbsp;kg)\n* Thrust: 150,000&nbsp;lbf (667&nbsp;kN)\n* Engine: [[Rocketdyne S-3D| Rocketdyne LR79-NA]] (Model S-3D)\n* ISP: 247.5 s (2.43&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg)\n* Burning time: 2 min. 37 sec.\n* Propellant consumption rate: 627.7&nbsp;lb/s (284.7&nbsp;kg/s)\n* Range: {{convert|1,500|mi|km|abbr=on}}\n* Flight time: 16 min 56.9 sec\n* Cutoff velocity: 8,984&nbsp;mph (14,458&nbsp;km/h) \u2013 Mach 13.04\n* Reentry velocity: 10,645&nbsp;mph (17,131&nbsp;km/h) \u2013 Mach 15.45\n* Acceleration: 13.69 ''g'' (134&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n* Peak deceleration: 44.0 ''g'' (431&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n* Peak altitude: {{convert|390|mi|km|abbr=on}}\n* CEP 4,925&nbsp;ft (1,500 m)\n* Warhead: 1.45 Mt Thermonuclear [[W49]] \u2013 1,650&nbsp;lb (750&nbsp;kg)\n* Fusing: Proximity and Impact\n* Guidance: Inertial\n\n==Launch vehicle derivatives==\n[[File:Jupiter-C vs Jupiter IRBM.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration showing differences among Redstone, Jupiter-C, Mercury-Redstone, and Jupiter IRBM.]]\n\nThe [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] rockets were manufactured by using a single Jupiter propellant tank, in combination with eight [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] rocket propellant tanks clustered around it, to form a powerful first stage [[launch vehicle]].\n\nThe Jupiter MRBM was also modified by adding upper stages, in the form of clustered [[MGM-29 Sergeant|Sergeant]]-derived rockets, to create a space launch vehicle called [[Juno II]], not to be confused with the [[Juno I]] which was a Redstone-Jupiter-C missile development. There is also some confusion with another U.S. Army rocket called the [[Jupiter-C]], which were Redstone missiles modified by lengthening the fuel tanks and adding small solid-fueled upper stages.\n\n===Specifications (Juno II launch vehicle)===\n{{Main|Juno II}}\n[[File:Juno II rocket.jpg|right|thumb|Juno II launch vehicle derived from Jupiter IRBM mobile missile.]]\n\nThe Juno II was a four-stage rocket derived from the Jupiter IRBM.

It was a [[liquid-propellant rocket]] using [[RP-1]] fuel and [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]] oxidizer, with a single [[Rocketdyne S-3D| Rocketdyne LR79-NA]] (model S-3D) [[rocket engine]] producing 667&nbsp;kN of thrust. It was armed with the 1.44&nbsp;megaton [[W49]] nuclear warhead. The prime contractor was the [[Chrysler Corporation]].\n\nThe Jupiter was originally designed by the [[US Army]], which was looking for a highly accurate missile designed to strike high-value targets like bridges, railway yards, troop concentrations and the like. The [[US Navy]] also expressed an interest in the design as an [[SLBM]], but left the collaboration to work on their [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]]. Jupiter retained the short, squat shape intended to fit in naval submarines.\n\n==Development history==\n\n===Initial concept===\nJupiter traces its history ultimately to the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] missile, the US's first nuclear ballistic missile. While it was entering service, [[Wernher von Braun]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] team at [[Redstone Arsenal]] began consider an upgraded version using the LR89 rocket engine being developed by [[Rocketdyne]] for the Air Force's [[Atlas missile]] project. Using the LR89 and adding a second stage would allow the new design to reach {{convert|1000|nmi}},{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}} a dramatic improvement over the Redstone's roughly {{convert|60|miles}}.\n\nAs Rocketdyne continued working on the LR89, it appeared that it could be improved to increase thrust over the promised {{convert|120000|lbf}}. In 1954, the Army asked Rocketdyne to provide a similar design with a thrust of {{convert|135000|lbf}}.{{sfn|Healy|1958|p=1}} During this same period, the weight of nuclear warheads was rapidly falling, and by combining this engine with a warhead of {{convert|2000|lbs}} they could build a single-stage missile able to reach {{convert|1500|nmi}} while being significantly less complicated and easier to handle in the field than a two-stage model. This engine was continually upgraded, ultimately reaching {{convert|150000|lbf}}.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}} This last model, known to the Army as the NAA-150-200, became much better known by its Rocketdyne model number, S-3.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=The Design}}\n\n===Navy SLBM interest===\n[[File:Arleigh Burke 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Arleigh Burke is credited with breaking the Navy out of its moribund ways, and pressing for development of the SLBM.]]\n\nAround the same time, the [[US Navy]] was looking for ways to join the nuclear club, and had been focusing mostly on [[cruise missile]]s and similar systems. Some consideration had been given to the use of ballistic missiles on ships, but Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]], \"father\" of the nuclear submarine, was skeptical that this could be done, and was worried it would take up funding needed elsewhere.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=135}} Another skeptic of missiles was the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Robert B. Carney]].{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\nLower-ranking Navy officials became increasingly interested when the Army and Air Force began serious development of their long-range missiles. In an attempt to bypass high-ranking Navy officials, who remained uninterested in the concept, the Navy liaison to the [[Killian Committee]] championed the cause. The Committee took up the concept, and in September 1955 released a report calling for the development of a sea-based missile system.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\nThe Navy's disinterest in missiles had been greatly reduced with the August 1955 appointment of Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] to replace Carney. Burke was convinced the Navy had to get into the missile field as rapidly as possible, and was well aware that the Air Force would oppose any such endeavor. Instead, he approached the Army, and found that the proposed Jupiter fit the range goals needed by the Navy.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}\n\n===Development begins===\nThe issue of who would be given the go-ahead to build an IRBM by this time had reached the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS), who proved unable to reach a decision. This forced the Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] to move ahead without an official recommendation from the military. He saw the Navy interest as a reasonable argument to continue the Army project in any event, and on 8 November 1955 approved both programs. The Air Force would develop IRBM No. 1, or SM-75 (for \"strategic missile\"), the Army would develop their design as IRBM No. 2 or SM-78. The Navy would develop systems to launch the Army missile from ships and, later, submarines.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=136}}{{sfn|Neufeld|1990|p=121}}\n\nThe requirement for shipboard storage and launching dictated the size and shape of the Jupiter. The original Army design was {{convert|92|feet}} long and {{convert|95|inch}} in diameter. The Navy stated they were not interested in anything longer than {{convert|50|feet}}. The ABMA team responded by increasing the diameter to {{convert|105|inch}}. This precluded it from being carried aboard contemporary [[cargo aircraft]], limiting it to sea and road. Even with this change, they were unable to reduce its length enough to suit the Navy. They suggested that they begin with a {{convert|60|foot}} long version and then scale it down as improvements in the engines were worked into the design. This was rejected, and after briefly considering a {{convert|55|foot}} version, finally settled on the {{convert|58|foot}} version.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Defining the Army/Navy Jupiter}}\n\nOn 2 December 1955, the secretaries of the Army and Navy publicly announced the dual Army\u2013Navy program to create a land- and sea-based MRBM. In April 1956, as part of a widespread effort to assign names to various missile projects, the Army's effort was given the name \"Jupiter\" and the Air Force's became \"Thor\".{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=IRBM Battle}}\n\n===Accuracy and mission===\nRedstone provided an accuracy of {{convert|300|m}} at its maximum range, which, when combined with its large warhead, allowed it to attack hard targets like protected airbases, bridges, command and control sites, as well as other strategic targets like railway marshaling yards and pre-attack concentration areas. This was in keeping with the Army's view of nuclear weapons, which was in effect more powerful [[artillery]]. They saw the weapons as part of a large-scale battle in Europe, in which both sides would use nuclear weapons during a limited war that did not include the use of strategic weapons on each other's cities. In that case, \"if wars were to be kept limited, such weapons would have to be capable of hitting only tactical targets.\" This approach saw the support of a number of influential theorists, notably [[Henry Kissinger]], and was seized on as a uniquely Army mission.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=132}}\n\nThe original goal for the new longer-range design was to match Redstone's accuracy at the Jupiter's much-extended range. That is, if Redstone could reach 300&nbsp;m at 60&nbsp;miles, the new design would provide a [[circular error probable]] on the order of {{convert|7|km}}. As development continued, it became clear the ABMA team, under the direction of [[Fritz Mueller]], could improve on that. This led to a period in which \"The Army would lay down a particular accuracy, and wait for our arguments whether it was possible. We had to promise a lot, but were fortunate.\"{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nThis process ultimately delivered a design intended to provide {{convert|0.5|mile}} accuracy at the full range, an order of magnitude better than Redstone and four times better than the best INS designs being used by the Air Force. The system was so accurate that a number of observers expressed their skepticism about the Army's goals, with the [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group|WSEG]] suggesting they were hopelessly optimistic.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe Air Force was dead set against Jupiter. They argued that nuclear weapons were not simple new artillery, and that their employment would immediately trigger a response that might result in a strategic exchange. This would especially be true if the Army launched a long-range weapon like Jupiter, which could reach cities in the Soviet Union and could not immediately be distinguished as attacking a military or civilian target. They suggested that any such launch would trigger a strategic response, and as such, the Army should not be given any long-range weapons.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nHowever, as von Braun's team went from success to success, and with Atlas still years from operational deployment, it was clear that Jupiter represented a threat to the Air Force's desired hegemony over strategic forces. This led to them starting their own MRBM program [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]], in spite of having repeatedly dismissed the medium-range role in the past.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p= 120}} The fighting between the Army and Air Force grew through 1955 and 1956 until practically every missile system the Army was involved in was being attacked in the press.<ref>{{cite news |title=Air Force Calls Army Unfit to Guard Nation |newspaper=New York Times |date=21 May 1956 |p=1}}</ref>\n\n===Navy exit===\n[[File:Polaris-a3.jpg|thumb|right|The Navy's Polaris had range similar to Jupiter.]]\n\nThe Navy was concerned from the start about Jupiter's [[cryogenic propellant]]s, but at the time there was no other option. Given the size and weight of contemporary nuclear weapons, only a large liquid-fuel rocket engine provided the energy needed to meet the Navy's range goal of launching from safe areas in the Atlantic Ocean. They justified the risk thus:\n\n{{cquote|We were prepared to take the chance that we might lose a submarine or two through accidental explosions. But, then, there are some of us who enjoy, or at lease &#91;sic&#93; are acclimated to, the idea of risking our lives.\"{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=137}}}}\n\nAll of this changed radically in the summer of 1956, when [[Project Nobska]] brought together leading scientists to consider antisubmarine warfare. As part of this workshop, [[Edward Teller]] stated that by 1963 a 1&nbsp;megaton warhead would be reduced to only {{convert|600|lbs}}.<ref>{{cite book |first=Elliot |last=Converse III |title= Rearming for the Cold War 1945 \u2013 1960 |url=http://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/acquisition_pub/OSDHO-Acquisition-Series-Vol1.pdf |page=527 |publisher= Government Printing Office |date= 2012}}</ref> Rocketry experts at the same meeting suggested that an intermediate-range weapon carrying one of these weapons could be built using [[solid propellant]]. Even in this case the missile would be much smaller than Jupiter; Jupiter was expected to weigh {{convert|160000|lb}}, while estimates of a solid-fuel missile with similar range were closer to {{convert|30000|lb}}, along with a similar reduction in size which was of paramount importance to a submarine design.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=138}}\n\nThe Navy announced their desire to develop their own missile that summer, initially under the name Jupiter-S. After intensive follow-up studies, the Navy withdrew from the Jupiter program in December 1956. This was officially announced by the Army in January 1957.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.redstone.army.mil/ihist-1957.html |title=Installation history, 1957 |website=US Army Redstone Arsenal History}}</ref> In its place, the Navy began development of what was then known as the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program, and the missile was later renamed [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]], their first [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM). Rickover, one of the few remaining skeptics, was won over by pointing out that a properly designed submarine was needed specifically for this role, and he would be called upon to produce it. Rickover was from that point on a staunch ally of the program.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=139}}\n\n===Saved from cancellation===\n[[File:McElroy at ABMA.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary of Defence Neil McElroy visits the Jupiter prototype assembly line at ABMA. ABMA built the test articles, while Chrysler built the production models.]]\n\nOn 4 October 1957, the Soviets successfully launched [[Sputnik I]] from their [[R-7 Semyorka]] ICBM. The US was aware of these efforts and had already talked to the press about it, suggesting that if the Soviets launched a satellite first it would be no big deal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1958-11/Galaxy_1958_11#page/n47/mode/2up | title=How Secret was Sputnik No. 1? | work=Galaxy | date=November 1958 | accessdate=13 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | pages=48\u201350}}</ref> To their surprise, the press exploded in rage over the affair. Having spent over a decade working on similar missiles, like [[Atlas ICBM|Atlas]], the fact that the Soviets could beat them was a serious blow, and prompted a deep review of the ongoing programs.<ref>{{cite news|last=David |first=Leonard |title=Sputnik 1: The Satellite That Started It All |work=Space.com |date=4 October 2002 |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sputnik_45th_anniversary_021004.html |accessdate=20 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216013800/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sputnik_45th_anniversary_021004.html |archivedate=16 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOne problem noted from the start was that the internecine fighting between the Army and Air Force was leading to significant duplication of effort, with little to show for it. The Department of Defense responded by creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA|ARPA]]), whose initial mission was to look over all of the ongoing projects and select ones based solely on their technical merits.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Air Force Gains Control}}\n\nAt the same time, the fighting had begun to have negative political effects. In a 26 November 1956 memorandum, recently appointed [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] attempted to end the fighting. His solution was to limit the Army to weapons with {{convert|200|mi|adj=on}} range, and those involved in surface-to-air defense to only {{convert|100|mi}}.<ref name=larsen>{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Larsen |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&dat=19570801&id=DuIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=x4oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7135,197246 |accessdate=18 May 2013 |title=New Battle Looms Over Army's Newest Missile |newspaper=Sarasota Journal |date=1 August 1957 |page=35}}</ref> The memo also placed limits on Army air operations, severely limiting the weight of the aircraft it was allowed to operate. To some degree this simply formalized what had largely already been the case in practice, but Jupiter fell outside the range limits and the Army was forced to hand them to the Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |last= Trest |first= Warren |title= Air Force Roles and Missions: A History |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=R4xOJW8EBwAC&pg=PA175 |publisher= Government Printing Office |year= 2010 |isbn= 9780160869303 |page=175}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Force, of course, had no interest in taking over a weapon system they had long argued was not needed. However, ARPA's studies clearly showed it was an excellent system, and as it was ready to enter production, any Air Force thoughts about canceling it were immediately quashed. New orders for 32 prototypes and 62 operational missiles were soon placed, bringing the total number of Jupiters to be built to 94. The first, hand-built at ABMA, would be delivered by the end of FY57, and the first production models from Chrysler's Michigan Ordnance Missile Plant near [[Warren, Michigan]] between FY58 and FY61.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Air Force Gains Control}}\n\n===Lingering complaints===\nA primary complaint about Jupiter was that the design's shorter range placed it within relatively easy striking distance of Soviet weapons, both missiles and aircraft. Thor, based in the UK, would likely have more warning of an impending attack.{{efn|The Army noted that an overwater approach to the UK meant that Thor had little warning at all.}} This is precisely the reason that the Army spent considerable effort on making Jupiter mobile, in order to make surprise attacks difficult without prior [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}\n\nHowever, in November 1958, the Air Force decided Jupiter would be launched from fixed emplacements. Army General [[Maxwell Taylor]] argued this was done deliberately, noting that:\n\n{{cquote|...a mobile missile needs Army-type troops to move, emplace, protect and fire it... a decision to organize mobile ballistic missile units would in logic have led to transferring the operational use of the weapon back to the Army \u2013 where it should have been all the time.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1993|p=131}}}}\n\nTo offset the possibility of air attack, the systems were upgraded to allow a launch within 15 minutes of a launch order.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc= Air Force Gains Control}}\n\n==Testing history==\nRocketdyne tested the first S-3 engine at their Santa Susana, California facilities in November 1955. A mock-up was delivered to ABMA in January 1956, followed by the first prototype engines in July 1956. Testing of these engines began in September 1956 at ABMA's new Power Plant Test Stand. This demonstrated a number of problems with unstable combustion, leading to the failure of four engines by November. To continue testing, the engine was temporarily derated back to 135,000&nbsp;lbf and was successfully tested at this level in January 1957. Continued work on the engine developed several sub-versions, finally reaching the design goal of 150,000&nbsp;lbf in the S-3D model.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Testing Jupiter, Propulsion}}\n\nThe 135,000 pound engine, also used in the first Thor and Atlas tests, had conical thrust chambers, but the 150,000 pound model switched to bell-shaped thrust chambers. Unlike Thor and Atlas, which had two small vernier engines for roll control, Jupiter gimbaled the turbine exhaust. The early test model Jupiters had two small gas jets powered off the turbine exhaust, the gimbaled exhaust pipe not being introduced until late 1958.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Static tests===\nIn 1954 Test Laboratory director Karl Heimburg began construction of the Static Test Stand for Redstone testing. This was still under construction when it was re-purposed for Jupiter, and finally completed in January 1957.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Testing Jupiter, Static Test}} A Jupiter was installed in the stand that month, and fired for the first time on 12 February 1957. This almost ended in disaster when a small explosion went off in the [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) pump, and as the missile sat there the LOX boiled off and threatened to burst the tanks. The day was saved when the foreman, Paul Kennedy, ran to the missile and connected a pressure line to drain the oxygen buildup in the tank. The problem was later traced to the lubricant used in the pump, which tended to burst into flames in contact with LOX. A new lubricant was introduced, along with a series of changes to the test stand to help retain control in these situations.<ref>{{cite web |first=Harry |last=Johnstone |title=The Life and Times of Harry M.

Redstone testing moved to these pads from the smaller LC-4 on 20 April 1955, with the launch of the seventh Redstone from LC-6. Envisioning an extended test program, a second set of similar pads began construction in 1956, LC-26 A and B; the only major difference was the blockhouse was located slightly further away, about {{convert|400|feet}}. In late 1957 a set of parallel railway tracks running just east of the pads was added, allowing an A-frame gantry to be rolled to any of the four pads.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=The Cape}}\n\nJupiters were delivered to the Cape strapped to wheeled trailers and flown to the Cape's \"Skid Strip\" on C-124s. They were then moved to Hangar R at the Cape Industrial Area where the nose cone was mated with the missile, and electrical checkout was performed. It was then moved on the trailer to the pads, about {{convert|3.5|miles}} south, where they were lifted to vertical by a crane on the movable gantry. Just to the north of the launch area was the Air Force's LC-17 for Thor, and LC-18 used for Thor and the Navy's [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]]. After the Army's head start, the Air Force had since caught up and attempted its first Thor launch on 26 January 1957, which ended with the missile exploding on the launch pad.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nJupiter test flights commenced with the launch of AM-1A (ABMA Missile 1A) on 1 March 1957 from LC-5. This missile was equipped with the lower-thrust interim engine. The vehicle performed well until past 50 seconds into launch when control started to fail, leading to breakup at T+73 seconds. It was deduced that turbopump exhaust was sucked up by the partial vacuum in the area behind the missile and began to burn in the tail section. The heat burned though the control wiring, so extra insulation was added there on future flights. An identical AM-1B was quickly readied and launched on 26 April. AM-1B's flight went entirely according to plan up to T+70 seconds when the missile started becoming unstable in flight and finally broke up at T+93 seconds. The failure was deduced to have been the result of propellant slosh due to bending modes induced by the steering maneuvers needed to perform the flight trajectory. The solution to this problem involved testing several types of baffles in a Jupiter center section until discovering a suitable type for both the LOX and fuel tanks.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nThe third Jupiter, also numbered AM-1, was quickly equipped with the baffles and launched on May 31, slightly over a month after AM-1B, traveling a full {{convert|1247|nmi}} downrange. This version had a slightly improved S-3 engine with {{convert|139000|lbf}} thrust. AM-2 flew from LC-26A on 28 August, and successfully tested the separation of the rocket body from the reentry vehicle section before splashing down at {{convert|1460|nmi}}. AM-3 flew from LC-26B on 23 October, including the ablative heat shield and the new ST-90 INS. This test flew a planned distance of {{convert|1100|nmi}}.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAM-3A launched on November 26 and all went according to plan until T+101 seconds when engine thrust abruptly terminated. The missile broke up at T+232 seconds. On December 18, AM-4 lost thrust T+117 seconds and fell into the ocean {{convert|149|nmi}} downrange. These failures were traced to an inadequate turbopump design that resulted in a string of failures in the Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas programs, all of which used a variant of the same Rocketdyne engine. Testing then paused for five months while Rocketdyne came up with a number of fixes and the Army retrofitted all its Jupiters with the redesigned pumps.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}} In spite of these failures, Jupiter was declared operational on 15 January 1958.\n\nTaking the time to also fully rate the engine to 150,000&nbsp;lbf, the new engine was first flown on AM-5 on 18 May 1958 from LC-26B, reaching a planned {{convert|1247|nmi}}. AM-5 also carried the real nose cone design, which separated from the rocket body, spun up the warhead, and separated to allow the warhead to continue on its own. The warhead section was equipped with a parachute and was recovered by the Navy some {{convert|28|nmi}} from its predicted splashdown point.{{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAM-6B included both the production nose cone and the ST-90 INS during its launch from LC-26B on 17 July 1958. This time the Navy recovered it only {{convert|1.5|nmi}} from its planned splash down point {{convert|1241|nmi}} downrange. AM-7 flew {{convert|1207|nmi}} on 27 August, testing a new solid fuel rocket for spinup, replacing the older hydrogen peroxide model. AM-9 was launched on 10 October, the first Jupiter to carry the fully functional turbine exhaust roll control system. The flight failed however; a pinhole leak in the thrust transducer area started a thrust section fire and loss of vehicle control. The Range Safety Officer destroyed the missile at T+49 seconds. {{sfn|Kyle|2011|loc=Jupiter Takes Flight}}\n\nAfterwards, there was only one more failure in the Jupiter program, AM-23 on 15 September 1959, which developed a leak in a nitrogen bottle that led to depressurization of the RP-1 tank and almost immediate loss of control at liftoff. The missile wobbled from side to side and the RP-1 tank began to break apart starting at T+7 seconds. The Jupiter flipped upside down, dumping out the contents of the RP-1 tank, followed by total vehicle breakup at T+13 seconds, just before the Range Safety Officer could issue the flight termination command. Flying debris struck and damaged a Juno II on the adjacent LC-5. This particular launch was carrying a biological nose cone with mice and other specimens (which did not survive).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jupiter.htm |title=Jupiter |website=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |accessdate=26 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010114842/http://astronautix.com/lvs/jupiter.htm |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThrough the early 1960s, a number of Jupiters were launched by the forces of other countries, as well as the Air Force, as part of ongoing combat training.

On 13 December 1958, Jupiter AM-13 was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida with a Navy-trained South American [[squirrel monkey]] named [[Gordo (monkey)|Gordo]] on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo did not survive the flight.

The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker lived for many years after the flight, finally succumbing to kidney failure on 29 November 1984 at the [[United States Space and Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama.\n\n==Operational deployment==\n[[File:864th Strategic Missile Squadron.PNG|right|thumb|125px|864th SMS insignia]]\n\nIn April 1958, under the command of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]], the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] notified the Air Force it had tentatively planned to deploy the first three Jupiter squadrons (45 missiles) in France. However, in June 1958 the new French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] refused to accept basing any Jupiter missiles in France. This prompted U.S. to explore the possibility of deploying the missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Air Force was already implementing plans to base four squadrons (60 missiles)\u2014subsequently redefined as 20 [[Royal Air Force]] squadrons each with three missiles\u2014of [[PGM-17 Thor]] IRBMs in Britain on airfields stretching from [[Yorkshire]] to [[East Anglia]].\n\nIn 1958, the United States Air Force activated the [[864th Strategic Missile Squadron]] at ABMA. Although the USAF briefly considered training its Jupiter crews at [[Vandenberg AFB]], California, it later decided to conduct all of its training at [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. In June and September of the same year the Air Force activated two more squadrons, the 865th and 866th.\n\nIn April 1959, the secretary of the Air Force issued implementing instructions to USAF to deploy two Jupiter squadrons to Italy. The two squadrons, totaling 30 missiles, were deployed at 10 sites in Italy from 1961 to 1963. They were operated by [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana|Italian Air Force]] crews, but USAF personnel controlled arming the nuclear warheads. The deployed missiles were under command of [[36th Air Brigade (Italy)|36th Strategic Interdiction Air Brigade]] (''36\u00aa Aerobrigata Interdizione Strategica'', Italian Air Force) at [[Gioia del Colle Air Base]], Italy.\n\nIn October 1959, the location of the third and final Jupiter MRBM squadron was settled when a government-to-government agreement was signed with Turkey. The U.S. and Turkey concluded an agreement to deploy one Jupiter squadron on NATO's southern flank. One squadron totaling 15 missiles was deployed at five sites near [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey from 1961 to 1963, operated by USAF personnel, with the first flight of three Jupiter missiles turned over to the T\u00fcrk Hava Kuvvetleri (Turkish Air Force) in late October 1962, but USAF personnel retaining control of nuclear warhead arming.\n\nOn four occasions between mid-October 1961 and August 1962, Jupiter mobile missiles carrying 1.4 megaton of TNT (5.9 PJ) nuclear warheads were struck by lightning at their bases in Italy. In each case, thermal batteries were activated, and on two occasions, tritium-deuterium [[Boosted fission weapon|\"boost\" gas]] was injected into the warhead pits, partially arming them. After the fourth lightning strike on a Jupiter MRBM, the USAF placed protective lightning strike-diversion tower arrays at all of the Italian and Turkish Jupiter MRBM missiles sites.\n\nIn 1962, a Bulgarian [[MiG-17]] reconnaissance airplane was reported to have crashed into an olive grove near one of the U.S. Jupiter missile launch sites in Italy, after overflying the site.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lednicer |first=David|title=Intrusions, Overflights, Shootdowns and Defections During the Cold War and Thereafter|url=http://mysite.ncnetwork.net/res12e522/ColdWar.html|website=Aviation History Pages|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=9 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the Turkish Jupiters had been installed, the missiles were already largely obsolete and increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attacks. All Jupiter MRBMs were removed from service by April 1963, as a backdoor trade with the Soviets in exchange for their [[Cuban Missile Crisis|earlier removal of MRBMs from Cuba]].\n\n===Deployment sites===\n{{kml}}\n;United States\n:[[Redstone Arsenal]], Huntsville, Alabama {{Coord|34|37|58.11|N|86|39|56.40|W|display=inline}}\n:[[White Sands Missile Range]], New Mexico {{Coord|32|52|47.45|N|106|20|43.64|W|display=inline}}\n\n;Republic of Italy\n[[File:Jupiter Deployment Italy.jpg|right|thumb|Deployment locations for Jupiter missiles in Italy from 1961 to 1963]]\n\n:Headquarters: [[Gioia del Colle Air Base]], the launch sites (built in a triangular configuration) were in the direct vicinity of the villages [[Acquaviva delle Fonti]], [[Altamura]] (two sites), [[Gioia del Colle]], [[Gravina in Puglia]], [[Laterza]], [[Mottola]], [[Spinazzola]], [[Irsina]] and [[Matera]].\n:Training Pad {{Coord|40|47|6.74|N|16|55|33.5|E|display=inline}}\n:Squadron 1\n::Site 1 {{Coord|40|44|24.59|N|16|55|58.83|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 3 {{Coord|40|35|42.00|N|16|51|33.00|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 4 {{Coord|40|48|47.05|N|16|22|53.08|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 5 {{Coord|40|45|32.75|N|16|22|53.08|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 7 {{Coord|40|57|43.98|N|16|10|54.66|E|display=inline}}\n:Squadron 2\n::Site 2 {{Coord|40|40|42.00|N|17|6|12.03|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 6 {{Coord|40|58|6.10|N|16|30|22.73|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 8 {{Coord|40|42|14.98|N|16|8|28.42|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 9 {{Coord|40|55|23.40|N|16|48|28.54|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 10 {{Coord|40|34|59.77|N|16|35|43.26|E|display=inline}}\n\n;Turkish Republic\n:Headquarters: [[Izmir Air Base|Cigli Air Base]]\n:Training Pad {{Coord|38|31|17.32|N|27|1|3.89|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 1 {{Coord|38|42|26.68|N|26|53|4.13|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 2 {{Coord|38|42|23.76|N|27|53|57.66|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 3 {{Coord|38|50|37.66|N|27|02|55.58|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 4 {{Coord|38|44|15.13|N|27|24|51.46|E|display=inline}}\n::Site 5 {{Coord|38|47|30.73|N|27|42|28.94|E|display=inline}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Jupiter IRBM.jpg|thumb|right|Jupiter with its \"petal\" cover open.]]\n[[File:Jupiter reentery vehicle.jpg|thumb|Jupiter was designed in an era when nuclear weapons were still very large and heavy. Its large reentry vehicle is typical of missile designs of the 1950s.]]\n\nJupiter squadrons consisted of 15 missiles and approximately 500 military personnel with five \"flights\" of three missiles each, manned by five officers and 10 NCOs. To reduce vulnerability, the flights were located approximately 30 miles apart, with the triple launcher emplacements separated by a distance of several hundred miles.\n\nThe ground equipment for each emplacement was housed in approximately 20 vehicles; including two generator trucks, a power distribution truck, short- and long-range [[theodolite]]s, a hydraulic and pneumatic truck and a liquid oxygen truck. Another trailer carried 6000 gallons of fuel and three liquid oxygen trailers each carried {{convert|4000|gal}}.\n\nThe missiles arrived at the emplacement on large trailers; while still on the trailer, the crew attached the hinged launch pedestal to the base of the missile which was hauled to an upright position using a winch. Once the missile was vertical, fuel and oxidizer lines were connected and the bottom third of the missile was encased in a \"flower petal shelter\", consisting of wedge-shaped metal panels, allowing crew members to service the missiles in all weather conditions. Stored empty, on 15-minute combat status in an upright position on the launch pad, the firing sequence included filling the fuel and oxidizer tanks with {{convert|68000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of LOX and {{convert|30000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of RP-1, while the guidance system was aligned and targeting information loaded. Once the fuel and oxidizer tanks were full, the launch controlling officer and two crewmen in a mobile launch control trailer could launch the missiles.\n\nEach squadron was supported by a receipt, inspection and maintenance (RIM) area to the rear of the emplacements. RIM teams inspected new missiles and provided maintenance and repair to missiles in the field. Each RIM area also housed 25 tons of liquid oxygen and nitrogen generating plants. Several times a week, tanker trucks carried the fuel from the plant to the individual emplacements.\n\n==Specifications (Jupiter MRBM)==\n* Length: 60&nbsp;ft (18.3 m)\n* Diameter: 8&nbsp;ft 9 in (2.67 m)\n* Total Fueled Weight: 108,804&nbsp;lb (49,353&nbsp;kg)\n* Empty Weight: 13,715&nbsp;lb (6,221&nbsp;kg)\n* Oxygen (LOX) Weight: 68,760&nbsp;lb (31,189&nbsp;kg)\n* RP-1 (kerosene) Weight: 30,415&nbsp;lb (13,796&nbsp;kg)\n* Thrust: 150,000&nbsp;lbf (667&nbsp;kN)\n* Engine: [[Rocketdyne S-3D| Rocketdyne LR79-NA]] (Model S-3D)\n* ISP: 247.5 s (2.43&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg)\n* Burning time: 2 min. 37 sec.\n* Propellant consumption rate: 627.7&nbsp;lb/s (284.7&nbsp;kg/s)\n* Range: {{convert|1,500|mi|km|abbr=on}}\n* Flight time: 16 min 56.9 sec\n* Cutoff velocity: 8,984&nbsp;mph (14,458&nbsp;km/h) \u2013 Mach 13.04\n* Reentry velocity: 10,645&nbsp;mph (17,131&nbsp;km/h) \u2013 Mach 15.45\n* Acceleration: 13.69 ''g'' (134&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n* Peak deceleration: 44.0 ''g'' (431&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n* Peak altitude: {{convert|390|mi|km|abbr=on}}\n* CEP 4,925&nbsp;ft (1,500 m)\n* Warhead: 1.45 Mt Thermonuclear [[W49]] \u2013 1,650&nbsp;lb (750&nbsp;kg)\n* Fusing: Proximity and Impact\n* Guidance: Inertial\n\n==Launch vehicle derivatives==\n[[File:Jupiter-C vs Jupiter IRBM.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration showing differences among Redstone, Jupiter-C, Mercury-Redstone, and Jupiter IRBM.]]\n\nThe [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] rockets were manufactured by using a single Jupiter propellant tank, in combination with eight [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] rocket propellant tanks clustered around it, to form a powerful first stage [[launch vehicle]].\n\nThe Jupiter MRBM was also modified by adding upper stages, in the form of clustered [[MGM-29 Sergeant|Sergeant]]-derived rockets, to create a space launch vehicle called [[Juno II]], not to be confused with the [[Juno I]] which was a Redstone-Jupiter-C missile development.

It was a [[predecessor state]] of the [[Netherlands]] and the first fully independent [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[nation state]].\n\nThe small republic of around 1.5&nbsp;million inhabitants distinguished itself by world trade through the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch East India Company (VOC)]] and the [[Dutch West India Company|Dutch West India Company (GWC)]], by its military campaigns against countries such as [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], by its huge fleet (with 2,000 ships, larger than that of England and France combined), by the flourishing of arts (painters such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and many others) and sciences (including [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]), and by its relatively tolerant atmosphere towards different religions and ideas ([[freedom of thought]]). Because Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world during much of the 17th century, this period became known in [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch history]] as the [[Dutch Golden Age]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 16th century, the [[Low Countries]]\u2014corresponding roughly to the present-day [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Luxembourg]]\u2014consisted of a number of [[Duchy|duchies]], counties, and [[prince-bishop]]rics, almost all of which were under the supremacy of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with the exception of the county of Flanders, most of which was under the [[Kingdom of France]].\n\nMost of the Low Countries had come under the rule of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|House of Burgundy]] and subsequently the [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1549 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] issued the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], which further unified the Seven Provinces under his rule. Charles was succeeded by his son, King [[Philip II of Spain]]. In 1568, the Netherlands, led by [[William I of Orange]], revolted against Philip II because of high taxes, persecution of Protestants by the government, and Philip's efforts to modernize and centralize the devolved-medieval government structures of the provinces.<ref>Pieter Geyl, ''History of the Dutch-Speaking Peoples, 1555\u20131648''. Phoenix Press, 2001, p. 55.</ref> This was the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. During the initial phase of the war, the revolt was largely unsuccessful. Spain had regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. This period is known as the \"[[Spanish Fury]]\" due to the high number of horrific massacres, instances of mass looting, and total destruction of multiple cities between 1572 and 1579.\n\nIn 1579, a number of the northern provinces of the Low Countries signed the [[Union of Utrecht]], in which they promised to support each other in their defence against the [[Army of Flanders]]. This was followed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], the declaration of independence of the provinces from Philip II. Dutch colonialism began at this point, as the Netherlands was able to swipe a number of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and Spanish colonies, particularly in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. After the assassination of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] on 10 July 1584, both [[Henry III of France]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]] declined offers of sovereignty. However, the latter agreed to turn the United Provinces into a [[protectorate]] of England ([[Treaty of Nonsuch]], 1585), and sent the [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] as governor-general. This was unsuccessful and in 1588 the provinces became a [[confederation|confederacy]]. The Union of Utrecht is regarded as the foundation of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, which was not recognized by the [[Spanish Empire]] until the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo-French War (1778)]], the internal territory was divided into two groups: the Patriots, who were pro-French and pro-American, and the Orangists, who were pro-British.{{sfn|Ertl|2008|p=217}} The Republic of the United Provinces faced a series of republican revolutions in 1783\u20131787. During this period, [[Republicanism in the Netherlands|republican forces]] occupied several major Dutch cities. Initially on the defence, the Orangist forces received aid from Prussian troops and [[Prussian invasion of Holland|retook the Netherlands]] in 1787. The republican forces fled to France, but then [[Flanders Campaign|successfully re-invaded]] alongside the army of the French Republic (1793\u20131795), ousting stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], abolishing the Dutch Republic, and replacing it with the [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806). After the French Republic became the French Empire under [[Napoleon]], the Batavian Republic was replaced by the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810).\n\nThe Netherlands regained independence from France in 1813. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] the names \"United Provinces of the Netherlands\" and \"United Netherlands\" were used. In 1815, it was rejoined with the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] (the \"Southern provinces\") to become the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], informally known as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], to create a strong [[buffer state]] north of France. On 16 March 1815, the son of stadtholder William V crowned himself King [[William I of the Netherlands]]. Between 1815 and 1890, the King of the Netherlands was also in a [[personal union]] the Grand Duke of the sovereign Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After Belgium [[Belgian Revolution|gained its independence]] in 1830, the state became unequivocally known as the \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\", as it remains today.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)|Financial history of the Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - De binnenplaats van de beurs te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] courtyard, 1653]]\nDuring the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the late-16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch Republic dominated [[History of international trade|world trade]], conquering a vast [[Dutch colonial empire|colonial empire]] and operating the largest fleet of [[Merchant ship|merchantmen]] of any nation.

The latter were governed directly by the [[States General of the Netherlands#Dutch Republic|States General]], the federal government. The States General were seated in [[The Hague]] and consisted of representatives of each of the seven provinces. The provinces of the republic were, in official feudal order:\n# [[Duchy of Guelders]]\n# [[County of Holland]]\n# [[County of Zeeland]]\n# [[Lordship of Utrecht]]\n# [[Lordship of Overijssel]]\n# [[Lordship of Frisia]]\n# [[Lordship of Groningen]]\n\nThere was an eighth province, the [[County of Drenthe]], but this area was so poor that it was exempt from paying federal taxes, and as a consequence, it was denied representation in the States General. Each province was governed by the Provincial States, the main executive official (though not the official head of state) was a ''[[raadspensionaris]]''. In times of war, the [[stadtholder]], who commanded the army, would have more power than the ''raadspensionaris''.\n\nIn theory, the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province. However, in practice the [[Prince of Orange|princes of Orange]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], beginning with [[William the Silent]], were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces. Zeeland and usually Utrecht had the same stadtholder as Holland. There was a constant power struggle between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders and specifically the princes of Orange, and the Republicans, who supported the States General and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces. They were federally governed [[Generality Lands]]. These were Staats-Brabant, Staats-Vlaanderen, Staats-Overmaas, and (after the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]) Staats-Opper-Gelre. The States General of the United Provinces were in control of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], but some shipping expeditions were initiated by some of the provinces, mostly Holland and Zeeland.\n\nThe framers of the [[U.S. Constitution]] were influenced by the Constitution of the Republic of the United Provinces, as [[Federalist No. 20]], by [[James Madison]], shows.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Madison|title=F\u0153deralist No. 20|date=11 December 1787|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._20}}</ref> Such influence appears, however, to have been of a negative nature, as Madison describes the Dutch confederacy as exhibiting \"Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.\" Apart from this, the [[American Declaration of Independence]] is similar to the [[Act of Abjuration]], essentially the declaration of independence of the United Provinces,<ref name = \"UWM06291998\">{{cite news|author=Barbara Wolff|title=Was Declaration of Independence inspired by Dutch? |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]|date=29 June 1998 |accessdate=14 December 2007}}</ref> but concrete evidence that the latter directly influenced the former is absent.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{see also|Arminianism|Remonstrants|History of the Netherlands#Refugees}}\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon - WGA25811.jpg|thumb|upright|Sermon at the [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk at Delft]], 1651]]\nIn the [[Union of Utrecht]] of 20 January 1579, Holland and Zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion (in practice, [[Calvinism]]). Every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished, although the Union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Unie_van_Utrecht|title=Unie van Utrecht \u2013 Wikisource|website=nl.wikisource.org}}</ref> William of Orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union, and, for him, the Union was a defeat. In practice, Catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden, and the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] became the \"public\" or \"privileged\" church in the Republic.<ref name=\"Israels\">{{cite book |last=Israel |first=J.

The extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders. In the beginning, this was especially focused on Roman Catholics, being the religion of the enemy. In 17th-century [[Leiden]], for instance, people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders (a year's wage for a skilled [[tradesman]]) and banned from the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=van Maanen |first=R.

This has become known as the struggle between [[Arminianism]] and [[Gomarism]], or between [[Remonstrants]] and [[Contra-Remonstrants]]. In 1618, the [[Synod of Dort]] tackled this issue, which led to the banning of the Remonstrant faith.\n\nBeginning in the 18th century, the situation changed from more or less active persecution of religious services to a state of restricted toleration of other religions, as long as their services took place secretly in [[Schuilkerk|private churches]].\n\n== Decline ==\n[[File:De handelsloge van de VOC in Hougly in Bengalen Rijksmuseum SK-A-4282.jpeg|thumb|[[Dutch East India Company]] factory in [[Hugli-Chuchura]], [[Mughal Bengal]]. Painting by Hendrik van Schuylenburgh, 1665]]\nLong-term rivalry between the two main factions in Dutch society, the ''Staatsgezinden'' (Republicans) and the ''Prinsgezinden'' (Royalists or [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]]), sapped the strength and unity of the country. [[Johan de Witt]] and the Republicans did reign supreme for a time at the middle of the 17th century (the [[First Stadtholderless Period]]) until his overthrow and murder in 1672. Subsequently, [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] became stadtholder. After a 22-year stadtholderless era, the Orangists regained power, and his first problem was to survive the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (with the derivative [[Third Anglo-Dutch war]]), when France, England, [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], and [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]] united against this country.\n\nWars to contain the expansionist policies of France in various coalitions after the [[Glorious Revolution]], mostly including England and Scotland\u2014after 1707, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]\u2014burdened the republic with huge debts, although little of the fighting after 1673 took place on its own territory. The necessity to maintain a vast army against France meant that less money could be spent on the navy, weakening the Republic's economy. After William III's death in 1702 the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]] was inaugurated. Despite having contributed much in the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the Dutch Republic gained little from the peace talks in [[Utrecht]] (1713). The end of the [[War of Austrian Succession]] in 1748, and Austria becoming allies with France against Prussia, marked the end of the republic as a major military power.<ref>O. van Nimwegen, ''De Republiek der Verenigde Nederlanden als grote mogendheid.

It was a [[predecessor state]] of the [[Netherlands]] and the first fully independent [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[nation state]].\n\nThe small republic of around 1.5 million inhabitants distinguished itself by world trade through the [[Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch East India Company (VOC)]] and the [[Dutch_West_India_Company|Dutch West India Company (GWC)]], by its military campaigns against countries such as [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], by its huge fleet (with 2,000 ships, larger than that of England and France combined), by the flourishing of arts (painters such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and many others) and sciences (including [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]), and by its relatively tolerant atmosphere towards different religions and ideas ([[freedom of thought]]). Because Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world during much of the 17th century, this period became known in [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch history]] as the [[Dutch Golden Age]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 16th century, the [[Low Countries]]\u2014corresponding roughly to the present-day [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Luxembourg]]\u2014consisted of a number of [[Duchy|duchies]], counties, and [[prince-bishop]]rics, almost all of which were under the supremacy of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with the exception of the county of Flanders, most of which was under the [[Kingdom of France]].\n\nMost of the Low Countries had come under the rule of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|House of Burgundy]] and subsequently the [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1549 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] issued the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], which further unified the Seven Provinces under his rule. Charles was succeeded by his son, King [[Philip II of Spain]]. In 1568, the Netherlands, led by [[William I of Orange]], revolted against Philip II because of high taxes, persecution of Protestants by the government, and Philip's efforts to modernize and centralize the devolved-medieval government structures of the provinces.<ref>Pieter Geyl, ''History of the Dutch-Speaking Peoples, 1555\u20131648''. Phoenix Press, 2001, p. 55.</ref> This was the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. During the initial phase of the war, the revolt was largely unsuccessful. Spain had regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. This period is known as the \"[[Spanish Fury]]\" due to the high number of horrific massacres, instances of mass looting, and total destruction of multiple cities between 1572 and 1579.\n\nIn 1579, a number of the northern provinces of the Low Countries signed the [[Union of Utrecht]], in which they promised to support each other in their defence against the [[Army of Flanders]]. This was followed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], the declaration of independence of the provinces from Philip II. Dutch colonialism began at this point, as the Netherlands was able to swipe a number of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and Spanish colonies, particularly in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. After the assassination of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] on 10 July 1584, both [[Henry III of France]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]] declined offers of sovereignty. However, the latter agreed to turn the United Provinces into a [[protectorate]] of England ([[Treaty of Nonsuch]], 1585), and sent the [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] as governor-general. This was unsuccessful and in 1588 the provinces became a [[confederation|confederacy]]. The Union of Utrecht is regarded as the foundation of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, which was not recognized by the [[Spanish Empire]] until the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo-French War (1778)]], the internal territory was divided into two groups: the Patriots, who were pro-French and pro-American, and the Orangists, who were pro-British.{{sfn|Ertl|2008|p=217}} The Republic of the United Provinces faced a series of republican revolutions in 1783\u20131787. During this period, [[Republicanism in the Netherlands|republican forces]] occupied several major Dutch cities. Initially on the defence, the Orangist forces received aid from Prussian troops and [[Prussian invasion of Holland|retook the Netherlands]] in 1787. The republican forces fled to France, but then [[Flanders Campaign|successfully re-invaded]] alongside the army of the French Republic (1793\u20131795), ousting stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], abolishing the Dutch Republic, and replacing it with the [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806). After the French Republic became the French Empire under [[Napoleon]], the Batavian Republic was replaced by the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810).\n\nThe Netherlands regained independence from France in 1813. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] the names \"United Provinces of the Netherlands\" and \"United Netherlands\" were used. In 1815, it was rejoined with the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] (the \"Southern provinces\") to become the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], informally known as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], to create a strong [[buffer state]] north of France. On 16 March 1815, the son of stadtholder William V crowned himself King [[William I of the Netherlands]]. Between 1815 and 1890, the King of the Netherlands was also in a [[personal union]] the Grand Duke of the sovereign Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After Belgium [[Belgian Revolution|gained its independence]] in 1830, the state became unequivocally known as the \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\", as it remains today.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)|Financial history of the Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - De binnenplaats van de beurs te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] courtyard, 1653]]\nDuring the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the late-16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch Republic dominated [[History of international trade|world trade]], conquering a vast [[Dutch colonial empire|colonial empire]] and operating the largest fleet of [[Merchant ship|merchantmen]] of any nation.

The latter were governed directly by the [[States General of the Netherlands#Dutch Republic|States General]], the federal government. The States General were seated in [[The Hague]] and consisted of representatives of each of the seven provinces. The provinces of the republic were, in official feudal order:\n# [[Duchy of Guelders]]\n# [[County of Holland]]\n# [[County of Zeeland]]\n# [[Lordship of Utrecht]]\n# [[Lordship of Overijssel]]\n# [[Lordship of Frisia]]\n# [[Lordship of Groningen]]\n\nThere was an eighth province, the [[County of Drenthe]], but this area was so poor that it was exempt from paying federal taxes, and as a consequence, it was denied representation in the States General. Each province was governed by the Provincial States, the main executive official (though not the official head of state) was a ''[[raadspensionaris]]''. In times of war, the [[stadtholder]], who commanded the army, would have more power than the ''raadspensionaris''.\n\nIn theory, the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province. However, in practice the [[Prince of Orange|princes of Orange]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], beginning with [[William the Silent]], were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces. Zeeland and usually Utrecht had the same stadtholder as Holland. There was a constant power struggle between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders and specifically the princes of Orange, and the Republicans, who supported the States General and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces. They were federally governed [[Generality Lands]]. These were Staats-Brabant, Staats-Vlaanderen, Staats-Overmaas, and (after the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]) Staats-Opper-Gelre. The States General of the United Provinces were in control of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], but some shipping expeditions were initiated by some of the provinces, mostly Holland and Zeeland.\n\nThe framers of the [[U.S. Constitution]] were influenced by the Constitution of the Republic of the United Provinces, as [[Federalist No. 20]], by [[James Madison]], shows.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Madison|title=F\u0153deralist No. 20|date=11 December 1787|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._20}}</ref> Such influence appears, however, to have been of a negative nature, as Madison describes the Dutch confederacy as exhibiting \"Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.\" Apart from this, the [[American Declaration of Independence]] is similar to the [[Act of Abjuration]], essentially the declaration of independence of the United Provinces,<ref name = \"UWM06291998\">{{cite news|author=Barbara Wolff|title=Was Declaration of Independence inspired by Dutch? |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]|date=29 June 1998 |accessdate=14 December 2007}}</ref> but concrete evidence that the latter directly influenced the former is absent.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{see also|Arminianism|Remonstrants|History of the Netherlands#Refugees}}\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon - WGA25811.jpg|thumb|upright|Sermon at the [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk at Delft]], 1651]]\nIn the [[Union of Utrecht]] of 20 January 1579, Holland and Zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion (in practice, [[Calvinism]]). Every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished, although the Union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Unie_van_Utrecht|title=Unie van Utrecht \u2013 Wikisource|website=nl.wikisource.org}}</ref> William of Orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union, and, for him, the Union was a defeat. In practice, Catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden, and the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] became the \"public\" or \"privileged\" church in the Republic.<ref name=\"Israels\">{{cite book |last=Israel |first=J.

The extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders. In the beginning, this was especially focused on Roman Catholics, being the religion of the enemy. In 17th-century [[Leiden]], for instance, people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders (a year's wage for a skilled [[tradesman]]) and banned from the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=van Maanen |first=R.

This has become known as the struggle between [[Arminianism]] and [[Gomarism]], or between [[Remonstrants]] and [[Contra-Remonstrants]]. In 1618, the [[Synod of Dort]] tackled this issue, which led to the banning of the Remonstrant faith.\n\nBeginning in the 18th century, the situation changed from more or less active persecution of religious services to a state of restricted toleration of other religions, as long as their services took place secretly in [[Schuilkerk|private churches]].\n\n== Decline ==\n[[File:De handelsloge van de VOC in Hougly in Bengalen Rijksmuseum SK-A-4282.jpeg|thumb|[[Dutch East India Company]] factory in [[Hugli-Chuchura]], [[Mughal Bengal]]. Painting by Hendrik van Schuylenburgh, 1665]]\nLong-term rivalry between the two main factions in Dutch society, the ''Staatsgezinden'' (Republicans) and the ''Prinsgezinden'' (Royalists or [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]]), sapped the strength and unity of the country. [[Johan de Witt]] and the Republicans did reign supreme for a time at the middle of the 17th century (the [[First Stadtholderless Period]]) until his overthrow and murder in 1672. Subsequently, [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] became stadtholder. After a 22-year stadtholderless era, the Orangists regained power, and his first problem was to survive the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (with the derivative [[Third Anglo-Dutch war]]), when France, England, [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], and [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]] united against this country.\n\nWars to contain the expansionist policies of France in various coalitions after the [[Glorious Revolution]], mostly including England and Scotland\u2014after 1707, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]\u2014burdened the republic with huge debts, although little of the fighting after 1673 took place on its own territory. The necessity to maintain a vast army against France meant that less money could be spent on the navy, weakening the Republic's economy. After William III's death in 1702 the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]] was inaugurated. Despite having contributed much in the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the Dutch Republic gained little from the peace talks in [[Utrecht]] (1713). The end of the [[War of Austrian Succession]] in 1748, and Austria becoming allies with France against Prussia, marked the end of the republic as a major military power.<ref>O. van Nimwegen, ''De Republiek der Verenigde Nederlanden als grote mogendheid.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty [[Baskerville]] and [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typefaces were considered for a basis, and the [[Legibility Group]] designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor [[Eric Gill]] at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that \"Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=202}}\n\nMorison's biographer [[Nicolas Barker]] has written that Morison's memos of the time wavered over a variety of options before it was ultimately concluded that Plantin formed the best basis for a condensed font that could nonetheless be made to fill out the full size of the letter space as far as possible. (Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was 'too basically circular' to be practical to condense in an attractive way.{{efn|Dreyfus shows proofs of the experimental recut of Perpetua with shortened descenders to allow tighter linespacing.<ref name=\"The Evolution of Times New Roman\" /> Morison later commented that \"it stared at the reader\".}})\n\n[[Walter Tracy]] and James Moran, who discussed the design's creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by [[Christophe Plantin]].

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. (Morison's friend Brooke Crutchley recorded in his diary being told by Morison that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\"<ref name=\"From a Cambridge Diary\">{{cite journal |last1=Crutchley |first1=Brooke |title=From a Cambridge Diary |journal=Matrix |date=1990 |volume=10 |publisher=[[Whittington Press]]}}</ref>)\n\n==Metal type versions==\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular families of titling capitals for headlines.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=39}} Walter Tracy in ''Letters of Credit'', Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=270}}{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}{{sfn|Hutt|1960|p=107}}\n\n===Titling===\nMonotype also created some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was intended for body text.<ref name=\"The Times: New roman and related founts.\" /> These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.<ref name=\"Linotype Times Eighteen\" />\n{{clear}}\n===Times Hever Titling===\n[[File:Times Hever Titling.jpg|thumb|right|Times Hever Titling from a Monotype specimen.]]\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a [[Caslon|Caslon-style]] A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous [[Bembo|Poliphilus]] design as an influence.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=208}} Named after [[Hever Castle]], the home of the ''Times''' owner [[John Jacob Astor|Lord Astor]] and designed early on, it was used by the ''Times'' for headings in the lighter sections such as [[Society reporting|society pages]], arts and fashion.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}<ref name=\"Comments on Typophile thread Savoie Hudson\">{{cite web|last1=Savoie|first1=Alice|last2=Hudson first2=John|title=Comments on Typophile thread |url=http://typophile.com/node/101099 |website=Typophile |accessdate=16 September 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717150729/http://typophile.com/node/101099 |archivedate=17 July 2014 }}</ref> It has not been digitised.\n\n===Times Wide (1938, series 427)===\nA variant intended for book printing, avoiding the slight condensation of the original Times New Roman.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder first showing\">{{cite journal|title=Typographic Problems of the Illustrated Book|journal=Monotype Recorder|date=1938|volume=37|issue=2|page=31|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_37_2.pdf|quote=Some types look larger, size for size, than others, because they have unusually short descenders and ascenders.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration. As a result of legal action, Linotype and its licensees continued to use the name Times Roman, while Monotype and its licensees used the name Times New Roman.<ref name=\"times-development\">{{cite web |url= http://www.truetype-typography.com/articles/times.htm |title=Times (New) Roman and its part in the Development of Scalable Font Technology |author=Charles Bigelow |year=1994 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Modern releases==\n\n===As Times New Roman===\nMonotype sells a wider range of styles and [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]] for Times New Roman than are offered with Windows, in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.<ref name=\"Changing the Times\" /> Its current release includes Regular, Medium, Semi Bold and Bold weights with matching italics, Extra Bold, Condensed (in regular, italic and bold), Seven (for smaller text, in regular, italic, bold and bold italic) and Small Text (for very small text, in regular, italic and bold).<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Library: Times New Roman|url=http://www.linotype.com/1540/TimesNewRoman-family.html|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> The four-weight version included with Windows was also distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Core Fonts for the Web]] package.<ref name=\"apple-techspot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.techspot.com/news/26438-microsoft-and-apple-extend-font-licensing-agreement.html |title=Microsoft and Apple extend font licensing agreement |author=Jose Vilches |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, the version of Times New Roman included with [[Windows 10]], version 6.96, includes [[small capitals]], [[text figures]], and italic [[swash capitals]].<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\">{{cite AV media | people = | date =\n | title = Times New Roman, v. 6.96 | medium = Font digitisation }}</ref><ref name=\"FIU New Roman Times Swash capital comment\">{{cite web |last1=Thiago |last2=Hardwig |first2=Florian |title=New Roman Times \u2013 Camper Van Beethoven |url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25135/new-roman-times-camper-van-beethoven#comment-631475 |website=Fonts in Use |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> The Microsoft/Monotype digitisation of Times New Roman omits automatic [[typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion (although as of v. 6.96 it is selectable),<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\" /> which the version of Times installed with macOS has.

He successfully recaptured the city and went back to his capital.\n\nAn armistice between the Almohads and the Christian kings of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] ensued. At the expiration of the truce, and having received news that Yaqub was gravely ill in Marrakesh and that his brother Abu Yahya, the governor of [[Al-Andalus]], had crossed the Mediterranean to declare himself king and take over Marrakesh, [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] decided to attack the [[Seville|region of Seville]] in 1194.<ref name=\"mo3jib\"/> A strong host under the [[archbishop of Toledo]] (Mart\u00edn L\u00f3pez de Pisuerga), which included the military [[Order of Calatrava]], ransacked the province. Having successfully crushed his brother's ambitions, Yaqub al-Mansur was left with no choice other than to lead an expedition against the Christians, who were now threatening the northern province of his empire.<ref name=\"mo3jib\">[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] \"Al-Mojib fi Talkhis Akhbar al-Maghrib\" [The Pleasant In Summarizing the History of the Maghreb\" (1224), pp.136-137</ref>\n\nOn the first day of June, 1195, he landed at [[Tarifa]]. Passing through the province of Seville, the main Almohad army reached [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]] on June&nbsp;30, reinforced by the few troops raised by the local governors and by a Christian cavalry contingent under [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro (died 1214)|Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro]], who held a personal feud against the Castilian king. On July&nbsp;4 Ya'qub moved out of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]]; his army crossed the pass of Muradal (Despe\u00f1aperros) and advanced through the plain of Salvatierra. A cavalry detachment of the [[Order of Calatrava]], plus some knights from nearby castles, tried to gather news about the Almohad strength and its heading; they were surrounded by [[Muslim]] scouts and almost exterminated,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} but managed to supply information to the Castilian king.\n\nAlfonso gathered his forces at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and marched down to Alarcos (al-Arak, in Arabic), near the [[Guadiana]] River, a place which marked the Southern limit of his kingdom and where a fortress was under construction. He intended on barring the access to the rich Tagus valley, and did not wait for the reinforcements the Kings [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n]] and [[Sancho VII of Navarre]] were sending.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When on July 16 the Almohad host came in view, [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] did not accept battle on this day or the day after, preferring to give rest to his forces; but early the day after that, Wednesday, July 18, the Almohad army formed for battle around a small hill called La Cabeza, two bow-shots from Alarcos.\n\n==Battle==\nYusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur gave to his vizier, Abu Yahya ibn Abi Hafs, command of a very strong vanguard: on the first line the [[Marinid dynasty|Bani Marin]] volunteers under Abu Jalil Mahyu ibn Abi Bakr, with a big body of archers and the [[Zenata]] Tribe; behind them, on the hill itself, the vizier with the Amir's banner and his personal guard, from the [[Hintata]] tribe; to the left the [[Arab]] host under Yarmun ibn Riyah; and to the right, the al-Andalus forces under the popular Caid Ibn Sanadid. Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur himself held command of the rearguard, which comprised the best [[Almohad]] forces commanded by Yabir ibn Yusuf, Abd al-Qawi, Tayliyun, Muhammad ibn Munqafad, and Abu Jazir Yajluf al-Awrabi and the black guard (of black Africans). It was a formidable army, whose strength Alfonso had badly underestimated. The Castilian king put most of his heavy cavalry in a compact body, about 8,000&nbsp;strong, and gave its command to  [[Diego L\u00f3pez II de Haro|Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro]], lord of Vizcaya. The king himself would follow with the infantry and the Military Orders.\n\nThe [[Christians|Christian]] cavalry charge was somewhat disordered. The knights crashed against the Zanatas and Bani Marin and dispersed them; lured by the Amir's standard, they charged uphill: Vizier Abu Yahya was killed,<ref>A\u1e25mad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Maqqar\u012b, Ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, ''The history of the Mohammedan dynasties in Spain'', (Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1843), lxv.</ref> and the Hintata fell almost to a man trying to protect themselves. Most of the knights turned to their left and after a fierce struggle they routed the [[al-Andalus]] forces of Ibn Sanadid. Three hours had passed; just afternoon, in the intense heat, the fatigue and the missiles which kept falling on them took their toll of armoured knights. The [[Arab]] right under Yarmun had been enveloping the Castilian flank and rear; at this point the best of the Almohad forces attacked, with the sultan himself clearly visible in the front ranks; and finally the knights were almost completely surrounded.\n\nAlfonso advanced with all his remaining forces into the melee, only to find himself assaulted from all sides and under a rain of arrows. For some time he fought hand-to-hand, until removed from the action, almost by force, by his bodyguard; they fled towards Toledo. The Castilian infantry was destroyed, together with most of the Orders which had supported them; the Lord of Vizcaya tried to force his way through the ring of enemy forces, but finally had to seek refuge in the unfinished fortress of Alarcos with just a fraction of his knights. The castle was surrounded with some 3,000&nbsp;people trapped inside, half of them women and children. The king's enemy, Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, who had taken little part in the action, was sent by the [[Amir]] to negotiate the surrender; L\u00f3pez de&nbsp;Haro and the survivors were allowed to go, leaving 12&nbsp;knights as hostages for the payment of a great ransom.\n\nThe Castilian field army had been destroyed. Those killed included three bishops (from Avila, Segovia, and Siguenza);<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Count Ordo\u00f1o Garc\u00eda de Roda and his brothers; Counts Pedro Ruiz de Guzm\u00e1n and Rodrigo S\u00e1nchez; the Masters of the Order of Santiago, Sancho Fern\u00e1ndez de Lemus, and of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Order of Aviz|Order of \u00c9vora]], Gon\u00e7alo Viegas. Losses for the Muslims included the death of the vizier and Abi Bakr, commander of the Bani Marin volunteers, who died of his wounds in the following year.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe outcome of the battle shook the stability of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] for several years. All nearby castles surrendered or were abandoned: Malag\u00f3n, Benavente, Calatrava,<ref>King, Georgiana Goddard, ''A brief account of the military orders in Spain'', (The Hispanic Society of America, 1921), 26.</ref> Caracuel, and Torre de Guadalferza, and the way to Toledo was wide open. However, [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur]] moved back to Seville to make good his own considerable losses; there he took the title of al-Mansur Billah ('The one victorious by God').\n\nFor the next two years, al-Mansur's forces devastated Extremadura, the [[Tagus]] valley, La Mancha and even the area around Toledo; they moved in turn against Mont\u00e1nchez, Trujillo, Plasencia, Talavera, Escalona and Maqueda. Some of these expeditions were led by the renegade [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro (died 1214)|Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro]]. Most significantly, however, these raids did not lead to any territorial gains for the caliph, although [[Almohad]] diplomacy did obtain an alliance with King [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n]] (who had been enraged when the Castilian king had not waited for him before the battle of Alarcos) and the neutrality of [[Navarre]]. These alliances proved to be temporary only.\n\nBut the caliph was losing interest in the affairs of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; he was in poor health, his objective of retaining a hold over al-Andalus appeared to be a complete success, and in 1198 he returned to [[Africa]]. He died in February 1199.\n\nHowever, the success of the battle proved to be short-lived. When the Almohad caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir]] attempted to build on it 16&nbsp;years later with a new Iberian offensive, he was crushingly defeated in the more decisive [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. This battle was to mark a turning-point that led to the end of Moorish rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The [[Almohad]] Empire itself collapsed a few years later.\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* A\u1e25mad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Maqqar\u012b, Ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, ''The history of the Mohammedan dynasties in Spain'', Vol.2, Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1843.\n* Britannica.com\n* [[Georgiana Goddard King|King, Georgiana Goddard]], ''A brief account of the military orders in Spain'', The Hispanic Society of America, 1921.\n* ''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', Ed.

When the Almohad caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir]] attempted to build on it 16&nbsp;years later with a new Iberian offensive, he was crushingly defeated in the more decisive [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. This battle was to mark a turning-point that led to the end of Moorish rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The [[Almohad]] Empire itself collapsed a few years later.\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* A\u1e25mad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Maqqar\u012b, Ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, ''The history of the Mohammedan dynasties in Spain'', Vol.2, Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1843.\n* Britannica.com\n* [[Georgiana Goddard King|King, Georgiana Goddard]], ''A brief account of the military orders in Spain'', The Hispanic Society of America, 1921.\n* ''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', Ed.

Gaster stated in his extensive preface his view (p. xx) that the ''Chronicles'' were compiled from several Hebrew sources, some quite ancient and others more recent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaster|first=Moses|title=The Chronicles of Jerahmeel|publisher=The Royal Asiatic society|year=1899|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe actual compiler of the chronicles identifies himself as \"Eleasar ben Asher the Levite\" who, according to Gaster, lived in the [[Rhineland]] in the 14th century.

Among the early sources quoted in the work is the 1st century Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]].\n\nGaster explained that he chose to title it \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\" instead of \"Chronicles of Eleasar\" because of his analysis that Eleasar was merely a compiler, while the enigmatic \"Jera\u1e25meel\" is the source most extensively reproduced, following the ''[[Yosippon]]'' which is otherwise extant. This 'Jerahmeel' has since been identified as Jerahmeel ben Solomon, thought to have flourished in Italy around 1150. After a thorough discussion of all the textual evidence, Gaster further concluded that, like the closely related ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', it relies on sources ultimately dependent on [[Isidore of Seville]], particularly evident in its mention of \"[[Franks]]\" and \"[[Lombards]]\" among the [[Sons of Noah]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Asatir]]\n* [[Jerahmeel]]\n* [[Samaritan Chronicle]]\n* [[Tolidah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/coj/index.htm The Chronicles of Jerahmeel at sacred-texts]\n*[https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofjera00eleaiala The Chronicles of Jerahmeel at archive.org]\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hebrew manuscripts]]\n[[Category:Hebrew-language chronicles]]\n[[Category:Old Testament pseudepigrapha]]\n[[Category:Samaritan culture and history]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\nThe '''''Chronicles of Jerahmeel''''' is a voluminous work that draws largely on [[Pseudo-Philo]]'s earlier history of Biblical events and is of special interest because it includes [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] versions of certain [[deuterocanonical]] books in the [[Septuagint]]. \n\nThe ''Chronicles'' were published in English as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GwPVMv0NxMQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Chronicles+of+Jerahmeel%22#PPR7,M1 The Chronicles of Jerahmeel Or, the Hebrew Bible Historiale]'' by the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], translated by [[Moses Gaster]], 1899.
