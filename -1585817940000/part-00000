Sometimes bruises can be serious, leading to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, such as when associated with serious injuries, including [[fracture (bone)|fracture]]s and more severe [[internal bleeding]].  The likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors, including type and healthiness of affected tissues. Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as \"black and blue\") in the days following the injury.\n\nHematomas can be subdivided by size. By definition, ecchymoses are 1 centimetres in size or larger, and are therefore larger than [[petechia|petechiae]] (less than 3 millimetres in diameter)<ref name=\":0\" /> or [[purpura]] (3 to 10 millimetres in diameter).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clinical Laboratory Hematology|last=McKenzie, Shirlyn B.|publisher=|others=Williams, Joanne Lynne, 1949-, Landis-Piwowar, Kristin|year=2014|isbn=9780133076011|edition=3rd|location=Boston|pages=665|oclc=878098857}}</ref> Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura.<ref name=\"urlCase Based Pediatrics Chapter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s16c03.html |title=Case Based Pediatrics Chapter |accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref> A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels.<ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary.  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ecchymosis; accessed 1/2/2012</ref><ref>Gould, George M.

Broken [[venule]]s or [[arteriole]]s often result in a deep blue or dark red bruise, respectively. Darker colored bruises may result from a more severe bleeding from both blood vessels.\n\n==Cause==\nThere are many causes of subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses.

Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of [[child abuse]], [[domestic abuse]], or serious medical problems such as [[leukemia]] or [[meningococcus|meningoccocal]] infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the [[navel]] (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute [[pancreatitis]]. Connective tissue disorders such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]] may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity. Spontaneous bruising or bruising with minimal trauma in the absence of other explanations and together with other minor or major criteria suggestive of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) suggests genetic testing for the condition. <ref>Byers PH.

Bruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size over the course of the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted. \n\n* Condition and type of tissue: In soft tissues, a larger area is bruised than would be in firmer tissue due to ease of blood to invade tissue.\n* Age: elderly skin and other tissues are often thinner and less elastic and thus more prone to bruising.\n* Gender: More bruising occurs in females due to increased [[subcutaneous fat]].\n* Skin tone: Discoloration caused by bruises is more prominent in lighter complexions.\n* Diseases: [[Coagulation]], [[platelet]] and blood vessel diseases or deficiencies can increase bruising due to more bleeding.\n* Location: More extensive vascularity causes more bleeding. Areas such as the arms, knees, shins and the facial area are especially common bruise sites. \n* Forces: Greater striking forces cause greater bruising.\n* Genes: Despite having completely normal coagulation factors, natural [[Red hair|redheads]] have been shown to bruise more, although this may just be due to greater visibility on commonly associated lighter complexion.<ref name= \"redhead\">{{cite journal |last1=Liem |first1=Edwin B. |last2=Hollensead |first2=Sandra C. |last3=Joiner |first3=Teresa V. |last4=Sessler |first4=Daniel I. |title=Women with Red Hair Report a Slightly Increased Rate of Bruising but Have Normal Coagulation Tests |journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=313\u20138 |year=2006 |pmid=16368849 |pmc=1351323 |doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000180769.51576.CD}}</ref>\n\n===Severity===\nBruises can be scored on a scale from 0\u20135 to categorize the severity and danger of the injury.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bruise harm score\n|-\n!

For example, a [[Muscle contraction|contracted]] muscle will bruise more severely, as will tissues crushed against underlying bone.  [[Capillary|Capillaries]] vary in strength, stiffness and toughness, which can also vary by age and medical conditions.\n\nLow levels of damaging forces produce small bruises and generally cause the individual to feel minor pain straight away. Repeated impacts worsen bruises, increasing the harm level. Normally, light bruises heal nearly completely within two weeks, although duration is affected by variation in severity and individual healing processes;<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/presentations/100207_3.htm | title = Medical Encyclopedia \u2013 Bruise healing | accessdate = 2007-09-09 |date=2007-08-31 | last = Voorhees | first = Benjamin W. }}</ref> generally, more severe or deeper bruises take somewhat longer.\n\nSevere bruising (harm score 2\u20133) may be dangerous or cause serious complications.  Further bleeding and excess fluid may accumulate causing a hard, fluctuating lump or swelling hematoma.  This has the potential to cause [[compartment syndrome]] in which the swelling cuts off blood flow to the tissues.  The trauma that induced the bruise may also have caused other severe and potentially fatal harm to internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].  For example, impacts to the head can cause [[traumatic brain injury]]: bleeding, bruising and massive swelling of the brain with the potential to cause [[concussion]], [[coma]] and death.  Treatment for brain bruising may involve emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain.\n\nDamage that causes bruising can also cause bones to be [[Bone fracture|broken]], [[tendon]]s or muscles to be [[strain (injury)|strained]], [[ligament]]s to be [[sprain]]ed, or other tissue to be damaged.  The symptoms and signs of these injuries may initially appear to be those of simple bruising. Abdominal bruising or severe injuries that cause difficulty in moving a limb or the feeling of liquid under the skin may indicate life-threatening injury and require the attention of a physician.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:US Army Vet Injury.JPG|thumb|Severe bruising resulting from yard work injury]]\nIncreased distress to tissue causes [[capillaries]] to break under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps into the surrounding tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. [[Nerve]] endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, may be perceived as pain or pressure or be [[asymptomatic]]. The damaged capillary [[endothelium]] releases [[endothelin]], a [[hormone]] that causes [[vasoconstriction|narrowing of the blood vessel]] to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying [[von Willebrand factor]] is exposed and initiates [[coagulation]], which creates a temporary [[clot]] to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.\n\nDuring this time, larger bruises may change color due to the breakdown of [[hemoglobin]] from within escaped [[red blood cell]]s in the extracellular space. The striking colors of a bruise are caused by the [[phagocytosis]] and sequential degradation of hemoglobin to [[biliverdin]] to [[bilirubin]] to [[hemosiderin]], with hemoglobin itself producing a red-blue color, biliverdin producing a green color, bilirubin producing a yellow color, and hemosiderin producing a golden-brown color.<ref name=Robbins /> As these products are cleared from the area, the bruise disappears. Often the underlying tissue damage has been repaired long before this process is complete.\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Black Eye 01.jpg|thumb|Remarkable healing of a [[black eye]] over a 9-day period caused by a [[wisdom tooth]] extraction.]]\nTreatment for light bruises is minimal and may include [[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] ([[Relaxation technique|rest]], [[Cryotherapy#Ice%20pack%20therapy|ice]], [[Cold compression therapy|compression]], and [[Anatomical terms of motion#Elevation%20and%20depression|elevation]]), [[painkiller]]s (particularly [[NSAID]]s) and, later in recovery, light stretching exercises. Particularly, immediate application of ice while elevating the area may reduce or completely prevent swelling by restricting blood flow to the area and preventing internal bleeding. Rest and preventing re-injury is essential for rapid recovery.\n\nVery gently massaging the area and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the [[History of pain theory#Gate control theory|gate control theory of pain]], although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/hw/skin_wounds/aa61479.asp | title = WebMD article on bruising }}</ref> As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.\n\nIn most cases hematomas spontaneously revert, but in cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs (''e.g.'', the brain), the physician may perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow blood to exit.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\nFolk medicine, including ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, has used bruising as a treatment for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping. [[Fire cupping]] uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping ([[Gua Sha]]) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin.

Sometimes bruises can be serious, leading to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, such as when associated with serious injuries, including [[fracture (bone)|fracture]]s and more severe [[internal bleeding]].  The likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors, including type and healthiness of affected tissues. Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as \"black and blue\") in the days following the injury.\n\nHematomas can be subdivided by size. By definition, ecchymoses are 1 centimetres in size or larger, and are therefore larger than [[petechia|petechiae]] (less than 3 millimetres in diameter)<ref name=\":0\" /> or [[purpura]] (3 to 10 millimetres in diameter).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clinical Laboratory Hematology|last=McKenzie, Shirlyn B.|publisher=|others=Williams, Joanne Lynne, 1949-, Landis-Piwowar, Kristin|year=2014|isbn=9780133076011|edition=3rd|location=Boston|pages=665|oclc=878098857}}</ref> Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura.<ref name=\"urlCase Based Pediatrics Chapter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s16c03.html |title=Case Based Pediatrics Chapter |accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref> A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels.<ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary.  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ecchymosis; accessed 1/2/2012</ref><ref>Gould, George M.

Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of [[child abuse]], [[domestic abuse]], or serious medical problems such as [[leukemia]] or [[meningococcus|meningoccocal]] infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the [[navel]] (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute [[pancreatitis]]. Connective tissue disorders such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]] may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity. Spontaneous bruising or bruising with minimal trauma in the absence of other explanations and together with other minor or major criteria suggestive of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) suggests genetic testing for the condition. <ref>Byers PH.

Bruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size over the course of the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted. \n\n* Condition and type of tissue: In soft tissues, a larger area is bruised than would be in firmer tissue due to ease of blood to invade tissue.\n* Age: elderly skin and other tissues are often thinner and less elastic and thus more prone to bruising.\n* Gender: More bruising occurs in females due to increased [[subcutaneous fat]].\n* Skin tone: Discoloration caused by bruises is more prominent in lighter complexions.\n* Diseases: [[Coagulation]], [[platelet]] and blood vessel diseases or deficiencies can increase bruising due to more bleeding.\n* Location: More extensive vascularity causes more bleeding. Areas such as the arms, knees, shins and the facial area are especially common bruise sites. \n* Forces: Greater striking forces cause greater bruising.\n* Genes: Despite having completely normal coagulation factors, natural [[Red hair|redheads]] have been shown to bruise more, although this may just be due to greater visibility on commonly associated lighter complexion.<ref name= \"redhead\">{{cite journal |last1=Liem |first1=Edwin B. |last2=Hollensead |first2=Sandra C. |last3=Joiner |first3=Teresa V. |last4=Sessler |first4=Daniel I. |title=Women with Red Hair Report a Slightly Increased Rate of Bruising but Have Normal Coagulation Tests |journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=313\u20138 |year=2006 |pmid=16368849 |pmc=1351323 |doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000180769.51576.CD}}</ref>\n\n===Severity===\nBruises can be scored on a scale from 0\u20135 to categorize the severity and danger of the injury.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bruise harm score\n|-\n!

For example, a [[Muscle contraction|contracted]] muscle will bruise more severely, as will tissues crushed against underlying bone.  [[Capillary|Capillaries]] vary in strength, stiffness and toughness, which can also vary by age and medical conditions.\n\nLow levels of damaging forces produce small bruises and generally cause the individual to feel minor pain straight away. Repeated impacts worsen bruises, increasing the harm level. Normally, light bruises heal nearly completely within two weeks, although duration is affected by variation in severity and individual healing processes;<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/presentations/100207_3.htm | title = Medical Encyclopedia \u2013 Bruise healing | accessdate = 2007-09-09 |date=2007-08-31 | last = Voorhees | first = Benjamin W. }}</ref> generally, more severe or deeper bruises take somewhat longer.\n\nSevere bruising (harm score 2\u20133) may be dangerous or cause serious complications.  Further bleeding and excess fluid may accumulate causing a hard, fluctuating lump or swelling hematoma.  This has the potential to cause [[compartment syndrome]] in which the swelling cuts off blood flow to the tissues.  The trauma that induced the bruise may also have caused other severe and potentially fatal harm to internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].  For example, impacts to the head can cause [[traumatic brain injury]]: bleeding, bruising and massive swelling of the brain with the potential to cause [[concussion]], [[coma]] and death.  Treatment for brain bruising may involve emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain.\n\nDamage that causes bruising can also cause bones to be [[Bone fracture|broken]], [[tendon]]s or muscles to be [[strain (injury)|strained]], [[ligament]]s to be [[sprain]]ed, or other tissue to be damaged.  The symptoms and signs of these injuries may initially appear to be those of simple bruising. Abdominal bruising or severe injuries that cause difficulty in moving a limb or the feeling of liquid under the skin may indicate life-threatening injury and require the attention of a physician.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:US Army Vet Injury.JPG|thumb|Severe bruising resulting from yard work injury]]\nIncreased distress to tissue causes [[capillaries]] to break under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps into the surrounding tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. [[Nerve]] endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, may be perceived as pain or pressure or be [[asymptomatic]]. The damaged capillary [[endothelium]] releases [[endothelin]], a [[hormone]] that causes [[vasoconstriction|narrowing of the blood vessel]] to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying [[von Willebrand factor]] is exposed and initiates [[coagulation]], which creates a temporary [[clot]] to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.\n\nDuring this time, larger bruises may change color due to the breakdown of [[hemoglobin]] from within escaped [[red blood cell]]s in the extracellular space. The striking colors of a bruise are caused by the [[phagocytosis]] and sequential degradation of hemoglobin to [[biliverdin]] to [[bilirubin]] to [[hemosiderin]], with hemoglobin itself producing a red-blue color, biliverdin producing a green color, bilirubin producing a yellow color, and hemosiderin producing a golden-brown color.<ref name=Robbins /> As these products are cleared from the area, the bruise disappears. Often the underlying tissue damage has been repaired long before this process is complete.\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Black Eye 01.jpg|thumb|Remarkable healing of a [[black eye]] over a 9-day period caused by a [[wisdom tooth]] extraction.]]\nTreatment for light bruises is minimal and may include [[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] ([[Relaxation technique|rest]], [[Cryotherapy#Ice%20pack%20therapy|ice]], [[Cold compression therapy|compression]], and [[Anatomical terms of motion#Elevation%20and%20depression|elevation]]), [[painkiller]]s (particularly [[NSAID]]s) and, later in recovery, light stretching exercises. Particularly, immediate application of ice while elevating the area may reduce or completely prevent swelling by restricting blood flow to the area and preventing internal bleeding. Rest and preventing re-injury is essential for rapid recovery.\n\nVery gently massaging the area and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the [[History of pain theory#Gate control theory|gate control theory of pain]], although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/hw/skin_wounds/aa61479.asp | title = WebMD article on bruising }}</ref> As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.\n\nIn most cases hematomas spontaneously revert, but in cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs (''e.g.'', the brain), the physician may perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow blood to exit.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\nFolk medicine, including ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, has used bruising as a treatment for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping. [[Fire cupping]] uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping ([[Gua Sha]]) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin.
