It is the [[sequel]] to the 2001 film ''[[Zoolander]]'' and stars Stiller, [[Owen Wilson]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] and [[Kristen Wiig]].\n\nFilming took place from April to July 2015, in [[Rome]], Italy. The film was released on February 12, 2016, by [[Paramount Pictures]] to generally negative reviews from critics and earned $56 million against a $55 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Plot sections should be between 400 and 700 words per WP:FILMPLOT. It currently has 685 words and should not be expanded.-->\nAt Fashion [[Interpol]], a secret agent, Valentina Valencia examines the expressions of recently assassinated pop singers' last images and believes they match Derek Zoolander's signature look, \"Blue Steel\". A flashback reveals that the ''Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good'' collapsed, killing Matilda Jeffries and injuring Hansel McDonald. Derek later lost custody of his son, Derek Zoolander Jr., and announced his retirement from modeling and subsequent reclusion.\n\nDerek now lives alone in \"extreme northern\" [[New Jersey]]. [[Billy Zane]] visits and gives him an invitation to the House of Atoz fashion show by the \"Queen of [[Haute couture|Haute Couture]]\", Alexanya Atoz, and persuades him to return to a regular lifestyle in order to regain custody of his son. In the \"uncharted [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] territories\", Hansel returns to his home after dinner and is informed by his orgy that they are all pregnant and that he is the father. He is later given the same invitation by Zane.\n\nAt the fashion show, Derek and Hansel are surprised to find that the ever-changing fashion world is now dominated by the likes of Don Atari and the [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] All. They are put on the runway in \"Old\" and \"Lame\" outfits and are doused by a large bucket of prunes. Afterwards, Alexanya congratulates them on their performance.\n\nAfter reuniting, Derek and Hansel are tracked down by Valentina, who asks them to help Interpol uncover who is behind the systematic assassinations. With Valentina's help, Derek discovers his son is residing at a local orphanage. They find him, but Derek is distraught by his son's obesity. After Matilda's ghost asks him to protect their son, Hansel convinces Derek to accept Derek Jr.  After meeting the Headmaster, Derek takes his son around Rome. However, Derek Jr. becomes disgruntled with his father and returns to the orphanage.\n\nHansel receives an anonymous call, requesting that he travel to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] at midnight. He, Derek, and Valentina go to the church and meet with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who tells them the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the little-known Steve, a secret that many popstars have died to protect. It is said that Steve is the common ancestor of all models and that he and his closest descendant (Derek Jr) holds the bloodline of the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Derek returns to the orphanage, only to find it in disrepair and his son and the Headmaster gone.\n\nHe travels to Jacobim Mugatu's isolated prison, but Mugatu tricks him into trading places with him so he can escape. Mugatu leaves on a helicopter while Hansel stows away by hiding on top of the rotor. Derek and Valentina swim back to Rome while Hansel infiltrates the House of Atoz. He witnesses Mugatu reuniting with Alexanya and killing Don Atari.\n\nHansel finds Derek Jr. imprisoned and reunites with Derek and Valentina at the [[Dance party|IncrediBALL]]. They enter a bathhouse through a rear entrance and witness Derek Jr. strapped to a sacrificial table. Mugatu and many of the world's fashion designers prepare to cut out Derek Jr.'s heart and consume his blood, believing it to grant them eternal youth as it contains the blood of Steve. Derek, Hansel, and Valentina stop Mugatu from proceeding and he reveals that he brought together the world's fashion designers to kill them as revenge for leaving him imprisoned.\n\nAlexanya, who is actually Katinka Ingaborgovinananananana in disguise, attacks Valentina, while Mugatu tells Derek that he was behind the destruction of his Center by hiring the construction crew to build a faulty base. He then throws an explosive towards the lava. Derek manages to stop it with \"Magnum\", but he struggles to keep it suspended in mid-air. Sting arrives and reveals that he is Hansel's father, and they, along with Derek Jr. releasing the look, \"El Ni\u00f1o\", successfully hurl the explosive back at Mugatu, killing him in process.\n\nDerek Jr. forgives his father for his mother's death and Derek and Valentina confess their love for each other. Matilda's ghost gives them her blessing and says that Mugatu live-streamed the event. Six weeks later, Derek and Hansel have returned to modeling.

It is the [[sequel]] to the 2001 film ''[[Zoolander]]'' and stars Stiller, [[Owen Wilson]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] and [[Kristen Wiig]].\n\nFilming took place from April to July 2015, in [[Rome]], Italy. The film was released on February 12, 2016, by [[Paramount Pictures]] to generally negative reviews from critics and earned $56 million against a $55 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Plot sections should be between 400 and 700 words per WP:FILMPLOT. It currently has 685 words and should not be expanded.-->\nAt Fashion [[Interpol]], a secret agent, Valentina Valencia examines the expressions of recently assassinated pop singers' last images and believes they match Derek Zoolander's signature look, \"Blue Steel\". A flashback reveals that the ''Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good'' collapsed, killing Matilda Jeffries and injuring Hansel McDonald. Derek later lost custody of his son, Derek Zoolander Jr., and announced his retirement from modeling and subsequent reclusion.\n\nDerek now lives alone in \"extreme northern\" [[New Jersey]]. [[Billy Zane]] visits and gives him an invitation to the House of Atoz fashion show by the \"Queen of [[Haute couture|Haute Couture]]\", Alexanya Atoz, and persuades him to return to a regular lifestyle in order to regain custody of his son. In the \"uncharted [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] territories\", Hansel returns to his home after dinner and is informed by his orgy that they are all pregnant and that he is the father. He is later given the same invitation by Zane.\n\nAt the fashion show, Derek and Hansel are surprised to find that the ever-changing fashion world is now dominated by the likes of Don Atari and the [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] All. They are put on the runway in \"Old\" and \"Lame\" outfits and are doused by a large bucket of prunes. Afterwards, Alexanya congratulates them on their performance.\n\nAfter reuniting, Derek and Hansel are tracked down by Valentina, who asks them to help Interpol uncover who is behind the systematic assassinations. With Valentina's help, Derek discovers his son is residing at a local orphanage. They find him, but Derek is distraught by his son's obesity. After Matilda's ghost asks him to protect their son, Hansel convinces Derek to accept Derek Jr.  After meeting the Headmaster, Derek takes his son around Rome. However, Derek Jr. becomes disgruntled with his father and returns to the orphanage.\n\nHansel receives an anonymous call, requesting that he travel to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] at midnight. He, Derek, and Valentina go to the church and meet with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who tells them the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the little-known Steve, a secret that many popstars have died to protect. It is said that Steve is the common ancestor of all models and that he and his closest descendant (Derek Jr) holds the bloodline of the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Derek returns to the orphanage, only to find it in disrepair and his son and the Headmaster gone.\n\nHe travels to Jacobim Mugatu's isolated prison, but Mugatu tricks him into trading places with him so he can escape. Mugatu leaves on a helicopter while Hansel stows away by hiding on top of the rotor. Derek and Valentina swim back to Rome while Hansel infiltrates the House of Atoz. He witnesses Mugatu reuniting with Alexanya and killing Don Atari.\n\nHansel finds Derek Jr. imprisoned and reunites with Derek and Valentina at the [[Dance party|IncrediBALL]]. They enter a bathhouse through a rear entrance and witness Derek Jr. strapped to a sacrificial table. Mugatu and many of the world's fashion designers prepare to cut out Derek Jr.'s heart and consume his blood, believing it to grant them eternal youth as it contains the blood of Steve. Derek, Hansel, and Valentina stop Mugatu from proceeding and he reveals that he brought together the world's fashion designers to kill them as revenge for leaving him imprisoned.\n\nAlexanya, who is actually Katinka Ingaborgovinananananana in disguise, attacks Valentina, while Mugatu tells Derek that he was behind the destruction of his Center by hiring the construction crew to build a faulty base. He then throws an explosive towards the lava. Derek manages to stop it with \"Magnum\", but he struggles to keep it suspended in mid-air. Sting arrives and reveals that he is Hansel's father, and they, along with Derek Jr. releasing the look, \"El Ni\u00f1o\", successfully hurl the explosive back at Mugatu, killing him in process.\n\nDerek Jr. forgives his father for his mother's death and Derek and Valentina confess their love for each other. Matilda's ghost gives them her blessing and says that Mugatu live-streamed the event. Six weeks later, Derek and Hansel have returned to modeling. Hansel returns to living with his orgy and is now the father of 10 children. Derek and Valentina have a daughter named Darlene, while Derek Jr. becomes the next model and now in a relationship with [[Malala Yousafzai]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT add Demi Lovato, Lenny Kravitz, Miley Cyrus, Usher, Bruce Springsteen, Olivia Munn, Kendall Jenner, Joe Jonas, Madonna, Susan Sarandon, or Lewis Hamilton; only their pics were briefly seen in the film or they appear in a crowd and had no actual roles-->\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Main credits order begins here. -->\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Derek Zoolander Sr.\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Hansel McDonald, Derek's best friend\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Jacobim Mugatu, a fashion mogul and main antagonist\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Valentina Valencia, Derek's love interest and 2nd wife\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Alexanya Atoz, Queen of Haute Couture\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as VIP\n* [[Kyle Mooney]] as Don Atari\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Katinka Ingaborgovinananananana, Mugatu's henchwoman\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as ghost of Matilda Jeffries, Derek's 1st late wife\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Evil DJ\n* [[Nathan Lee Graham]] as Todd\n* [[Cyrus Arnold]] as Derek Zoolander Jr., Derek & Matilda's son and Valentina's stepson\n* [[Billy Zane]] as himself<ref>{{cite web|last=Jang |first=Meena |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-zane-zoolander-2-actor-790206 |title=Billy Zane 'Zoolander 2:' Actor Reveals Role in Sequel |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jon Daly (comedian)|Jon Daly]] as Agent Filippo\n* [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as himself\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as All<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/zoolander-2/full-trailer-cumberbatch-bieber/|title=Zoolander 2 trailer: death to Justin Bieber, and Benedict Cumberbatch as you've never seen him before |newspaper=The Telegraph|date=November 18, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- Main credits order ends here. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Cameos===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Beck Bennett]] as Geoff Mille\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Maury\n* [[Katy Perry]] as herself\n* [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] as himself\n* [[Tommy Hilfiger]] as himself\n* [[Naomi Campbell]] as herself\n* [[Justin Bieber]] as himself<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rosen |first=Christopher |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/29/justin-bieber-zoolander-2-cameo |title=Justin Bieber: Zoolander 2 cameo revealed by Ben Stiller |magazine=EW.com |date=April 13, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jourdan Dunn]] as Natalka, one of Hansel's orgy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/zoolander-2/celebrity-cameos-list/|title=Does Zoolander 2 have more celebrity cameos than any other movie?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Ariana Grande]] as SM girl<ref name=\"GrandeSarandon\">{{cite web|last=Sarandon |first=Susan |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/susan-sarandon-on-death-row-stories.html?mid=twitter_vulture |title=Susan Sarandon on Death Row Stories, Ariana Grande, and Doing TV for the First Time |publisher=Vulture.com |date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}; and Rankin, Seija.
