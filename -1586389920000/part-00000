Here he pursued his exegetical, theological and historical researches, the results of which appeared in his ''Lehrbuch des christlichen Glaubens'' (\"Textbook of Christian Faith\", 1764). This work caused some commotion, as much by the novelty of its method as by the [[heterodoxy]] of its matter, and more by its omissions than by its positive teaching, though everywhere the author sought to put theological doctrines in a decidedly modern form.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1767 Teller, whose attitude had made his position at [[Helmstedt]] intolerable, accepted an invitation from the [[Prussia]]n minister for ecclesiastical affairs to the post of [[provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Cologne]], with a seat in the Lutheran Supreme [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory]] of [[Berlin]]. Here he found himself in the company of the rationalistic theologians of Prussia: [[Friedrich Samuel Gottfried Sack]] (1738\u20131817), [[Johann Joachim Spalding]] (1714\u20131804) and others and became one of the leaders of the rationalistic party, and one of the chief contributors to [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai|CF Nicolai]]'s ''Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek''.

The object of this work was to recast the language and ideas of the [[New Testament]] and give them the form of 18th-century [[illuminism]]. The author maintains that the [[Greek language|Graeco]]-[[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebraic]] expressions must not be interpreted literally, but explained in terms intelligible to the modern mind.

Museum,<ref name=McDonald/> \"a group of black actors worker-players who earned their living as teachers, clerks, and industrial workers, and cannot thus be considered amateurs in the manner of

Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man who grew up in Port Elizabeth and who recently returned from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them \"as he had the know-how theatrically\u2014the tricks, how to use the stage, movements, everything\"; they worked with Athol Fugard since then, \"and that is how the Serpent Players got together.\"<ref name=Ufahamu>\"'Art is Life and Life is Art'.

Available from: [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9qb6w2wz eScholarship], University of California. Accessed 26 July 2017.</ref> At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Shakespeare]] and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in [[California]], Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'', which was considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: \"We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to take a look at our play and our work. ... We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That\u2019s it. Other attributes are merely labels.\"<ref name=Ufahamu /> They mainly performed at the St Stephen's Hall \u2013 renamed the Douglas Ngange Mbopa Memorial Hall in 2013 \u2013 adjacent to St Stephen's Church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth.\n\nAccording to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago, \n<blockquote>the Serpent Players used [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]'s elucidation of [[Gestus|gestic acting]], dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African [[vaudeville]], to explore the theatrical force of [[Epic Theatre|Brecht's techniques]], as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle|Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and, a year later, on ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''<ref name=McDonald/> led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still [2004] South Africa's most distinctive ''Lehrst\u00fcck'' [learning play]:'The Coat''. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, ''The Coat'' dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.<ref name=Kruger217f/></blockquote>\n\nThe Serpent Players conceptualised and co-authored many plays that they subsequently went on to perform for a variety of audiences in many theatres around the world. The following are some of their notable and most popular plays:\n\n* Their first production was [[Niccolo Machiavelli]]'s ''[[La Mandragola]]'', directed by Fugard as ''[[The Cure]]'' and set in the township. Other productions include [[Georg Buchner]]'s ''[[Woyzeck]]'', Brecht's ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and Sophocles' ''[[Antigone]]''. When the group had turned to improvisation, they came up with classic works such as ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'' and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'', emerging as inner experiences of the actors who are also the co-authors of the plays.\n* In ''The Coat'', Kruger observes, \"The participants were engaged not only in representing social relationships on stage but also on enacting and revising their own dealings with each other and with institutions of apartheid oppression from the law courts downward\", and \"this engagement testified to the real power of Brecht's apparently [[utopia]]n plan to abolish the separation of player and audience and to make of each player a 'statesman' or social actor.... Work on ''The Coat'' led indirectly to the Serpent Players' most famous and most Brechtian productions, ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead|Sizwe Bansi is Dead]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'' (1973).\"<ref name=Kruger217f/>\nFugard developed these two plays for the Serpent Players in workshops, working with [[John Kani]] and [[Winston Ntshona]],<ref name=Kruger217f/> publishing them in 1974 with his own play ''Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act'' (1972). The authorities considered the title of ''The Island'', which alludes to [[Robben Island]], the prison where [[Nelson Mandela]] was being held, too controversial, so Fugard and the Serpent Players used the alternative title ''The Hodoshe Span'' (''Hodoshe'' meaning \"carrion fly\" in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]).\n* These plays \"espoused a Brechtian attention to the demonstration of [[Gestus|gest]] and social situations and encouraged audiences to analyze rather than merely applaud the action\"; for example, ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'', which infused a Brechtian critique and [[vaudeville|vaudevillian irony]]-\u2013especially in Kani's virtuoso improvisation-\u2013even provoked an African audience's critical interruption and interrogation of the action.<ref name=Kruger217f/> \n* While dramatising frustrations in the lives of his audience members, the plays simultaneously drew them into the action and attempted to have them analyse the situations of the characters in Brechtian fashion, according to Kruger.<ref name=Kruger217f/>\n* ''Blood Knot'' was filmed by [[BBC Two|BBC Television]] in 1967, with Fugard's collaboration, starring the [[Jamaica]]n actor [[Charles Hyatt]] as Zachariah and Fugard himself as Morris, as in the original 1961 premi\u00e8re in Johannesburg.<ref name=FugardNotebooks>{{cite book|author=Athol Fugard|title=''Notebooks 1960\u20131977''|publisher=Craighall: A.

Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man who grew up in Port Elizabeth and who recently returned from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them \"as he had the know-how theatrically\u2014the tricks, how to use the stage, movements, everything\"; they worked with Athol Fugard since then, \"and that is how the Serpent Players got together.\"<ref name=Ufahamu>\"'Art is Life and Life is Art'.

Available from: [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9qb6w2wz eScholarship], University of California. Accessed 26 July 2017.</ref> At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Shakespeare]] and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in [[California]], Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'', which was considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: \"We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to take a look at our play and our work. ... We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That\u2019s it. Other attributes are merely labels.\"<ref name=Ufahamu /> They mainly performed at the St Stephen's Hall \u2013 renamed the Douglas Ngange Mbopa Memorial Hall in 2013 \u2013 adjacent to St Stephen's Church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth.\n\nAccording to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago, \n<blockquote>the Serpent Players used [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]'s elucidation of [[Gestus|gestic acting]], dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African [[vaudeville]], to explore the theatrical force of [[Epic Theatre|Brecht's techniques]], as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle|Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and, a year later, on ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''<ref name=McDonald/> led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still [2004] South Africa's most distinctive ''Lehrst\u00fcck'' [learning play]:'The Coat''. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, ''The Coat'' dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.<ref name=Kruger217f/></blockquote>\n\nThe Serpent Players conceptualised and co-authored many plays that they subsequently went on to perform for a variety of audiences in many theatres around the world. The following are some of their notable and most popular plays:\n\n* Their first production was [[Niccolo Machiavelli]]'s ''[[La Mandragola]]'', directed by Fugard as ''[[The Cure]]'' and set in the township. Other productions include [[Georg Buchner]]'s ''[[Woyzeck]]'', Brecht's ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' and Sophocles' ''[[Antigone]]''. When the group had turned to improvisation, they came up with classic works such as ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'' and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'', emerging as inner experiences of the actors who are also the co-authors of the plays.\n* In ''The Coat'', Kruger observes, \"The participants were engaged not only in representing social relationships on stage but also on enacting and revising their own dealings with each other and with institutions of apartheid oppression from the law courts downward\", and \"this engagement testified to the real power of Brecht's apparently [[utopia]]n plan to abolish the separation of player and audience and to make of each player a 'statesman' or social actor.... Work on ''The Coat'' led indirectly to the Serpent Players' most famous and most Brechtian productions, ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead|Sizwe Bansi is Dead]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Island (play)|The Island]]'' (1973).\"<ref name=Kruger217f/>\nFugard developed these two plays for the Serpent Players in workshops, working with [[John Kani]] and [[Winston Ntshona]],<ref name=Kruger217f/> publishing them in 1974 with his own play ''Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act'' (1972). The authorities considered the title of ''The Island'', which alludes to [[Robben Island]], the prison where [[Nelson Mandela]] was being held, too controversial, so Fugard and the Serpent Players used the alternative title ''The Hodoshe Span'' (''Hodoshe'' meaning \"carrion fly\" in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]).\n* These plays \"espoused a Brechtian attention to the demonstration of [[Gestus|gest]] and social situations and encouraged audiences to analyze rather than merely applaud the action\"; for example, ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'', which infused a Brechtian critique and [[vaudeville|vaudevillian irony]]-\u2013especially in Kani's virtuoso improvisation-\u2013even provoked an African audience's critical interruption and interrogation of the action.<ref name=Kruger217f/> \n* While dramatising frustrations in the lives of his audience members, the plays simultaneously drew them into the action and attempted to have them analyse the situations of the characters in Brechtian fashion, according to Kruger.<ref name=Kruger217f/>\n* ''Blood Knot'' was filmed by [[BBC Two|BBC Television]] in 1967, with Fugard's collaboration, starring the [[Jamaica]]n actor [[Charles Hyatt]] as Zachariah and Fugard himself as Morris, as in the original 1961 premi\u00e8re in Johannesburg.<ref name=FugardNotebooks>{{cite book|author=Athol Fugard|title=''Notebooks 1960\u20131977''|publisher=Craighall: A.
