A philanthropist, in 1892 he established the charitable Fresh Air Fund, still in operation and now known as Pearson's Holiday Fund, to enable disadvantaged children to partake in outdoor activities. In 1898, he purchased the ''Morning Herald'', and in 1900 merged it into his new creation, the [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] ''Daily Express''.\n\nThe ''Express'' was a departure from the papers of its time and created an immediate impact by carrying news instead of only advertisements on its front page.

He was educated at [[Winchester College]] in Hampshire.

In 1898, he purchased the ''Morning Herald'', and in 1900 merged it into his new creation, the [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] ''Daily Express''.\n\nThe ''Express'' was a departure from the papers of its time and created an immediate impact by carrying news instead of only advertisements on its front page.

The ZX series is what was known as the Ninja line of Kawasaki motorcycles in the 1980s and still carries the name today.\n\n== History ==\nKawasaki introduced the ZX-6R in 1995 with very similar looks and features like the 1994 introduced [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-9R|ZX-9R]], including the [[ram-air intake]] that had been developed by Kawasaki since the 1990 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11|ZX-11 (ZZ-R1100)]].<ref name=ramairtest>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/ram-air-test///|title=Ram Air: Test|magazine=Sport Rider|accessdate=February 15, 2016|date=October 1999}}</ref>  The first ZX-6R had a dry weight of {{cvt|401.2|lb}}, wet weight of {{cvt|454|lb}}, and was capable of accelerating {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} in 3.6&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThere was a major revamp of the ZX-6R in 1998 with the Launch of the G series. The G series saw no increase in displacement but power went from 100&nbsp;[[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|BHP]] to 108&nbsp;BHP thanks to the newly designed airbox.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The fairing was revamped, but it retained a similar design for the [[Headlamp|headlight]], air intakes and windscreen. In 2000, the first J series replaced the G, increasing power to 112&nbsp;BHP by increasing the [[compression ratio]] from 11.8:1 to 12.8:1.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The J series sported a couple of modernisations including a 180 section rear tire, second headlight, uprated generator and [[Ignition coil|stick coils]] (coil on plug) replacing the traditional coil with HT lead.\n\nWith strong competition from Honda's [[Honda CBR600F4i|CBR600F4i]], Suzuki's [[Suzuki GSX-R600|GSX-R600]], and Yamaha's [[Yamaha YZF-R6|YZF-R6]], Kawasaki decided on an unusual move for the late 2002 models. They increased the capacity of the traditional {{cvt|600|cc}} motor to {{convert|636|cc}} with the ZX-6R A1P. This version used the J series bodywork with the only notable differences being the \"636\" stickers on the fairing. For riders who needed bikes for displacement-restricted [[Motorcycle racing|racing]], Kawasaki also made available a limited production {{cvt|599|cc}} version, the Ninja ZX-6RR, but the {{cvt|636|cc|cuin}} ZX-6R would be their main mass production middleweight sport bike.\n\nIn 2003, there were a number of changes to the ZX-6R, or ZX636 as it is often referred. The engine was [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] and engine speed was raised around 500&nbsp;RPM which resulted in a slight gain in power. Radial-mounted four-piston brakes replaced the previous six-piston brakes and the front forks were now inverted. Chassis improvements resulted in higher rigidity and less weight. An all digital instrument panel was also introduced and a larger ram-air intake inlet moved to the center over the headlight, running through the headstock. The bike, designation B1H, carried over to the 2004 model year with just color scheme changes. The ZX-6RR won the Supersport category award for [[Masterbike]] 2004 and placed third overall.\n\nIn 2005, Kawasaki again revamped the ZX-6R. Engine speed increased again by 1,000&nbsp;RPM resulting in {{cvt|113|hp}} at 12,250&nbsp;RPM.<ref name=\"SRspecs\"/> The frame and [[swingarm]] were updated, but the main changes from its predecessor lay in the design. The [[Aluminium alloy|aluminum]] frame was now painted flat black, fairings were more round, and integrated [[Automotive lighting|turn signals]] were used (euro model). The [[Exhaust system|exhaust]] was now centrally under the seat (a configuration commonly referred to as an undertail exhaust). Most of these changes were mirrored in the 599&nbsp;cc ZX-6RR. For the second year in a row, the ZX-6RR again won the Supersport category award for Masterbike 2005 and placed third overall. The bike carried over to the 2006 model year with minor [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] changes and new color schemes.\n\nAfter four years of offering their 636&nbsp;cc ZX-6R for street use and an entirely separate 599&nbsp;cc ZX-6RR for displacement-restricted racing classes, Kawasaki offered only one ZX-6R for 2007, and it displaced 599&nbsp;cc. Previous years of the ZX-6R's engines were all built from the same basic design, but the all-new engine for 2007 was redesigned from the [[crankcase]] up. In following with what their competitors had already been doing, Kawasaki's new engine featured a stacked gear arrangement in which the crankshaft, primary drive and [[Jackshaft|countershaft]] are placed in a triangular format for a shorter, more compact powerplant. Now about 40&nbsp;mm smaller in both length and width and it is said to yield greater cornering clearance. By using a former 125&nbsp;cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] racer as the ZX-6R's chief development rider, [[Tomomi Manako]], Kawasaki claims a focus has been put on track usage. Frame, swingarm, suspension, brakes, and body were completely redesigned and the bike shares very few parts from the previous model. The ZX-6R was carried over to the 2008 model year with just color scheme changes.\n\nFor 2009, Kawasaki dramatically changed the appearance of the ZX-6R to match the more angular look of the ZX-10R. Kawasaki claims the new ZX-6R is 10&nbsp;kg lighter than the previous model. The greatest changes for 2009 were the redesign of the exhaust, now carried low and not requiring the thick under-seat construction of 2008 and especially the introduction of the [[Showa Corporation|Showa]] Big Piston Fork (BPF)<ref name=Ash2010>{{Citation |title= Big Piston Forks |work= Ash on Bikes |first=  Kevin |last= Ash |url= http://www.ashonbikes.com/content/big-piston-forks |accessdate= March 11, 2012 |postscript= &nbsp;Originally published in the [[Motor Cycle News]] Tech Watch column |year=2010 }}</ref> suspension for a more progressive brake-dive. The 2010 ZX-6R is changing once more with an improved engine and [[slipper clutch]]. The exhaust pre-chamber has more space and also limits exhaust noise giving the rider a smoother ride. New double bore intake funnels features two available heights which gives performance upgrades in both high and low engine speeds. The front seat is now lower.\n\nFor 2013, Kawasaki reintroduced the ZX-6R 636, while still continuing to sell the regular, 599&nbsp;cc 2009-2012 ZX-6R at a lower price.\n\nThe 2013 ZX-6R 636 is a brand new bike. Engine displacement has again been increased to 636&nbsp;cc, with two fuel maps available to choose via a switch on the handlebars. The new version has increased torque and horsepower, and the increased performance is apparent at lower RPM. While the tail is to the one in the 2009-2012 model, it features new front and side fairings, new dash, new frame, new Showa BPF-SFF front suspension, Kawasaki [[Traction control system|Traction Control]] (KTRC) with three modes (sport, city and rain) as standard equipment, and Kawasaki Intelligent [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock Brake System]] (KIBS) available as option.\n\nIn Showa's Big Piston Fork - Separate Function Fork (BPF-SFF) suspension, the left leg bar a bigger and stronger spring than the right one, with regulated pre-load. The right bar has bigger oil damper section, with regulated rebound and compression damping. According to the manufacturer, this asymmetric design provides a reduction of the [[friction]] inside the fork, significant mass loss and more friendly response of suspension. The KTRC system uses manipulation of the ignition timing on all 3 traction control modes, while mode 3 (rain mode) also uses a separate throttle controlled by the on-board electronics, to allow faster reaction for wheel over-spin on slippery surfaces. Traction control and power modes can be adjusted or turned off whenever the throttle is closed, even while riding the bike. The bike is sold without a [[steering damper]], as customer complaints about the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] steering damper on previous models prompted Kawasaki to discontinue this feature on subsequent models.\n\nThe ZX-6R 636 for 2019 has some updates consisting of: [[Euro4]] compliance, KQS [[quickshifter]] (up only), updated bodywork and seat, [[LED]] headlights and updated dashboard. The claimed horsepower also sees a slight drop from the 2018 model's {{cvt|129.3|hp|order=flip}} to {{convert|127.3|hp|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.superbike.co.uk/bike-tests/new-bike-news/kawasaki-announces-all-new-zx6r-636-for-2019/|title=Kawasaki announces new ZX6R 636 for 2019}}</ref><ref name=firstlooks>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcycle.com/mini-features/new-2019-kawasaki-ninja-zx-6r-coming-oct-11.html|last=Chung |first=Dennis |title=New 2019 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Coming Oct. 11| publisher =Motorcycle.com|accessdate=October 11, 2018|date=August 13, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThrough the 2020 model year, Kawasaki sold only the {{cvt|636|cc}} displacement Ninja ZX-6R in most markets, while in Japan the {{cvt|599|cc}} version continues to be sold alongside the 636 since the model year 2003 onwards.<ref>{{Citation |url= https://www.kawasaki-motors.com/mc/lineup/ |publisher=Kawasaki Motors Japan |title= Product Lineup |year=2020 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://www.kawasaki.co.uk/en/products |publisher=Kawasaki Motors UK |year=2020 |title=Products }}</ref>\n\n=== Motorsport ===\n[[Kenan Sofuo\u011flu]] helped Kawasaki to win both the riders and manufacturers title during the [[2015 Supersport World Championship season]].\n\n== Specifications ==\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!\n! width=\"10%\" | 1995-1997<br>ZX-6R\n! width=\"10%\" | 1998\u20131999<br>ZX-6R<ref>{{cite book |title=Kawasaki ZX600 & 636 (ZX-6R) Service & Repair Manual |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=2003 |pages=10\u201313 |isbn=1844250652}}</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2000-2002<br>ZX-6R\n! width=\"10%\" | 2003\u20132004<br>ZX-6RR\n! width=\"10%\" | 2005\u20132006<br>ZX-6RR<ref name=\"2006RRspecs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kawasaki.com/site/Kawasaki/Techpubs/English/spec_id/2006/sp_ZX600N6F.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232048/http://www.kawasaki.com/site/Kawasaki/Techpubs/English/spec_id/2006/sp_ZX600N6F.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }} article from Kawasaki.com</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2007\u20132008<br>ZX-6R<ref name=\"2007specs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kawasaki.com/site/Kawasaki/Techpubs/English/spec_id/2007/sp_ZX600P7F.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232058/http://www.kawasaki.com/site/Kawasaki/Techpubs/English/spec_id/2007/sp_ZX600P7F.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }} article from Kawasaki.com</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2009\u20132012<br>ZX-6R<ref name=\"2009specs\">[http://www.kawasaki.com/Products/product-specifications.aspx?id=374 2009 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204074017/http://kawasaki.com/Products/product-specifications.aspx?id=374 |date=2009-02-04 }} article from Kawasaki.com</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2003\u20132004<br>ZX-6R\n! width=\"10%\" | 2005\u20132006<br>ZX-6R<ref name=\"2006Rspecs\">[http://www.kawasaki.com/HTML/MOTORCYCLES/product_print.aspx?product=19 2006 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905141434/http://www.kawasaki.com/HTML/MOTORCYCLES/product_print.aspx?product=19 |date=2006-09-05 }} article from Kawasaki.com</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2013\u20132018<br>ZX-6R<ref name=\"2013specs\">[http://www.kawasaki.com/Products/product-details-features.aspx?autoplay=false&id=715&scid=24 2013 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R Specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012052933/http://www.kawasaki.com/Products/product-details-features.aspx?autoplay=false&id=715&scid=24 |date=2012-10-12 }}</ref>\n! width=\"10%\" | 2019-present<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Kawasaki ZX-6R Ninja technical specifications |url=https://www.moto-data.net/kawasaki/zx-6r-ninja-2019}}</ref><br>ZX-6R<br>\n|-\n!

The ZX series is what was known as the Ninja line of Kawasaki motorcycles in the 1980s and still carries the name today.\n\n== History ==\nKawasaki introduced the ZX-6R in 1995 with very similar looks and features like the 1994 introduced [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-9R|ZX-9R]], including the [[ram-air intake]] that had been developed by Kawasaki since the 1990 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11|ZX-11 (ZZ-R1100)]].<ref name=ramairtest>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/ram-air-test///|title=Ram Air: Test|magazine=Sport Rider|accessdate=February 15, 2016|date=October 1999}}</ref>  The first ZX-6R had a dry weight of {{cvt|401.2|lb}}, wet weight of {{cvt|454|lb}}, and was capable of accelerating {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} in 3.6&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThere was a major revamp of the ZX-6R in 1998 with the Launch of the G series. The G series saw no increase in displacement but power went from 100&nbsp;[[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|BHP]] to 108&nbsp;BHP thanks to the newly designed airbox.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The fairing was revamped, but it retained a similar design for the [[Headlamp|headlight]], air intakes and windscreen. In 2000, the first J series replaced the G, increasing power to 112&nbsp;BHP by increasing the [[compression ratio]] from 11.8:1 to 12.8:1.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The J series sported a couple of modernisations including a 180 section rear tire, second headlight, uprated generator and [[Ignition coil|stick coils]] (coil on plug) replacing the traditional coil with HT lead.\n\nWith strong competition from Honda's [[Honda CBR600F4i|CBR600F4i]], Suzuki's [[Suzuki GSX-R600|GSX-R600]], and Yamaha's [[Yamaha YZF-R6|YZF-R6]], Kawasaki decided on an unusual move for the late 2002 models. They increased the capacity of the traditional {{cvt|600|cc}} motor to {{convert|636|cc}} with the ZX-6R A1P. This version used the J series bodywork with the only notable differences being the \"636\" stickers on the fairing. For riders who needed bikes for displacement-restricted [[Motorcycle racing|racing]], Kawasaki also made available a limited production {{cvt|599|cc}} version, the Ninja ZX-6RR, but the {{cvt|636|cc|cuin}} ZX-6R would be their main mass production middleweight sport bike.\n\nIn 2003, there were a number of changes to the ZX-6R, or ZX636 as it is often referred. The engine was [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] and engine speed was raised around 500&nbsp;RPM which resulted in a slight gain in power. Radial-mounted four-piston brakes replaced the previous six-piston brakes and the front forks were now inverted. Chassis improvements resulted in higher rigidity and less weight. An all digital instrument panel was also introduced and a larger ram-air intake inlet moved to the center over the headlight, running through the headstock. The bike, designation B1H, carried over to the 2004 model year with just color scheme changes. The ZX-6RR won the Supersport category award for [[Masterbike]] 2004 and placed third overall.\n\nIn 2005, Kawasaki again revamped the ZX-6R. Engine speed increased again by 1,000&nbsp;RPM resulting in {{cvt|113|hp}} at 12,250&nbsp;RPM.<ref name=\"SRspecs\"/> The frame and [[swingarm]] were updated, but the main changes from its predecessor lay in the design. The [[Aluminium alloy|aluminum]] frame was now painted flat black, fairings were more round, and integrated [[Automotive lighting|turn signals]] were used (euro model). The [[Exhaust system|exhaust]] was now centrally under the seat (a configuration commonly referred to as an undertail exhaust). Most of these changes were mirrored in the 599&nbsp;cc ZX-6RR. For the second year in a row, the ZX-6RR again won the Supersport category award for Masterbike 2005 and placed third overall. The bike carried over to the 2006 model year with minor [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] changes and new color schemes.\n\nAfter four years of offering their 636&nbsp;cc ZX-6R for street use and an entirely separate 599&nbsp;cc ZX-6RR for displacement-restricted racing classes, Kawasaki offered only one ZX-6R for 2007, and it displaced 599&nbsp;cc. Previous years of the ZX-6R's engines were all built from the same basic design, but the all-new engine for 2007 was redesigned from the [[crankcase]] up. In following with what their competitors had already been doing, Kawasaki's new engine featured a stacked gear arrangement in which the crankshaft, primary drive and [[Jackshaft|countershaft]] are placed in a triangular format for a shorter, more compact powerplant. Now about 40&nbsp;mm smaller in both length and width and it is said to yield greater cornering clearance. By using a former 125&nbsp;cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] racer as the ZX-6R's chief development rider, [[Tomomi Manako]], Kawasaki claims a focus has been put on track usage. Frame, swingarm, suspension, brakes, and body were completely redesigned and the bike shares very few parts from the previous model. The ZX-6R was carried over to the 2008 model year with just color scheme changes.\n\nFor 2009, Kawasaki dramatically changed the appearance of the ZX-6R to match the more angular look of the ZX-10R. Kawasaki claims the new ZX-6R is 10&nbsp;kg lighter than the previous model. The greatest changes for 2009 were the redesign of the exhaust, now carried low and not requiring the thick under-seat construction of 2008 and especially the introduction of the [[Showa Corporation|Showa]] Big Piston Fork (BPF)<ref name=Ash2010>{{Citation |title= Big Piston Forks |work= Ash on Bikes |first=  Kevin |last= Ash |url= http://www.ashonbikes.com/content/big-piston-forks |accessdate= March 11, 2012 |postscript= &nbsp;Originally published in the [[Motor Cycle News]] Tech Watch column |year=2010 }}</ref> suspension for a more progressive brake-dive. The 2010 ZX-6R is changing once more with an improved engine and [[slipper clutch]]. The exhaust pre-chamber has more space and also limits exhaust noise giving the rider a smoother ride. New double bore intake funnels features two available heights which gives performance upgrades in both high and low engine speeds. The front seat is now lower.\n\nFor 2013, Kawasaki reintroduced the ZX-6R 636, while still continuing to sell the regular, 599&nbsp;cc 2009-2012 ZX-6R at a lower price.\n\nThe 2013 ZX-6R 636 is a brand new bike. Engine displacement has again been increased to 636&nbsp;cc, with two fuel maps available to choose via a switch on the handlebars. The new version has increased torque and horsepower, and the increased performance is apparent at lower RPM. While the tail is to the one in the 2009-2012 model, it features new front and side fairings, new dash, new frame, new Showa BPF-SFF front suspension, Kawasaki [[Traction control system|Traction Control]] (KTRC) with three modes (sport, city and rain) as standard equipment, and Kawasaki Intelligent [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock Brake System]] (KIBS) available as option.\n\nIn Showa's Big Piston Fork - Separate Function Fork (BPF-SFF) suspension, the left leg bar a bigger and stronger spring than the right one, with regulated pre-load. The right bar has bigger oil damper section, with regulated rebound and compression damping. According to the manufacturer, this asymmetric design provides a reduction of the [[friction]] inside the fork, significant mass loss and more friendly response of suspension. The KTRC system uses manipulation of the ignition timing on all 3 traction control modes, while mode 3 (rain mode) also uses a separate throttle controlled by the on-board electronics, to allow faster reaction for wheel over-spin on slippery surfaces. Traction control and power modes can be adjusted or turned off whenever the throttle is closed, even while riding the bike. The bike is sold without a [[steering damper]], as customer complaints about the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] steering damper on previous models prompted Kawasaki to discontinue this feature on subsequent models.\n\nThe ZX-6R 636 for 2019 has some updates consisting of: [[Euro4]] compliance, KQS [[quickshifter]] (up only), updated bodywork and seat, [[LED]] headlights and updated dashboard.

Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Continued use ===\nDespite the advantages of positive ventilation systems, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing, and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.
