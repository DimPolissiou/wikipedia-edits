Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].

Over years, the band would perform over 100 shows in the Eastern Canadian area, sharing the stage with notable acts including [[Propagandhi]], [[Strike Anywhere]], The Video Dead, [[Chixdiggit]] and [[Hostage Life]], and would go on to record two full-length albums, their debut ''A Declaration of Intent'', followed by ''The Infamous'' as well as a split 7\" vinyl EP ''All These Lives'' and a NOFX tribute album, released on 7\" vinyl, titled ''Don't Eat Meat''.\n\n==History==\n\n===2004 - Band formation & recording / release of ''A Declaration of Intent''===\n\nSoon after Phil Campeau and Franck Chevrier formed the band in 2004, the band quickly wrote and recorded their first album, ''A Declaration Of Intent'' with the help of [[The Sainte Catherines]]' Rich Bouthillier filling in on drums, and their guitarist Marc-Andre Beaudet behind the mixing console. Shortly after the independent release of ''A Declaration Of Intent'', Rich Bouthillier's busy schedule with The Sainte Catherines made it clear he could not be Humanifesto's full-time drummer. Not long thereafter, former bandmate of Franck Chevrier's, Andrew McGrath was recruited on drums, and the band's longest-lasting line-up was established.\n\n===2006 - recording / release of ''All These Lives'' EP===\n\nThe band's first EP consisted of the first three songs written with the band's new line up - ''All these lives'', ''Yesterday's Headlines'' and ''Sitting Duck Hunt'' - and was recorded at the beginning of 2006. The title song ''All these Lives'' was later released as a single on the [[Make Trade Fair]] compilation album, released by Lower Left Records to raise awareness of alternatives to [[sweatshop]] labour. The two additional tracks ''Yesterday's Headlines'' and ''Sitting Duck Hunt'' were released on a split 7\" vinyl with I Am The Cartographer, on Hip Kid Records in August 2007.\n\n===2006 - recording / release of ''Don't Eat Meat'' 7\" EP===\n\nIn the summer of 2006, the band returned into the studio to record a new EP, entitled ''Don't Eat Meat''. This project was in fact a tribute to [[NOFX]]'s ''[[Fuck The Kids]]'' EP, performing the music arrangements and vocal melodies from the NOFX disc, but replacing the original lyrics with Humanifesto-style left-wing political ones. After shelving the project for a year while working on other projects, [[Fat Mike]] of NOFX authorized Humanifesto to release the project on 7\" vinyl. This disc was issued in spring 2008 by KOI Records in Texas.\n\n===2007-2010 - recording / release of ''The Infamous''===\n\nThe band's second full-length album was titled ''The Infamous'' (not to be mistaken with [[The Infamous]] studio album by [[Mobb Deep]]).<ref>http://www.punknews.org/review/9762/humanifesto-the-infamous</ref> The album was unique in its concept as every song title on the album including the album title itself, were an anagram of the band's name. Notable song titles included on this release were \"Oh, Meat Is Fun!\", \"US Anthem of I\", \"Some Thai Fun\", \"Atheism of UN\" and \"South Famine\". The original version of this album was written, recorded and mixed between 2007 and 2008 with the band's established three-piece line up (Phil Campeau, Franck Chevrier, Andrew McGrath) but due to growing discord between band members and friction with the studio where it had been recorded, the recording never made it to mastering and was eventually shelved and never released. This episode led to Andrew McGrath's departure from the band, and subsequent relocation to Malta in late 2009. It wasn't before a shuffle in line up, which saw Dan Audette join the band on lead guitar, and Justin Santora sit in on drums, that ''The Infamous'' was re-recorded and released on [[Koi Records]] in 2010. In May 2010, and in support of ''The Infamous'' the band toured Quebec and Ontario with bandmates Society's Ills, before drummer, Justin Santora, was forced to leave Montreal and return home to Chicago.\n\n===2010 - Elegy===\n\nThe last official Humanifesto recording was a song called Elegy, the drum tracks for which were recorded by Andrew McGrath overseas in March 2010 at the [http://www.templestudios.com/ Temple Studios] in Malta, the same studio where [[Rammstein]] recorded platinum record, [[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]].\n\n===Break-up===\n\nThe last Humanifesto show was on June 12 of 2010, in Montreal at Cafe Chaos and featured Andrew McGrath back behind the drums. It was seen as a serendipitous reunion and highlighted an end to the discord which had permeated much of the period between 2007\u20132008.\n\nIn January 2011, it was announced via the Humanifesto Facebook page that the band would be \"moving on to new projects\".

Produced by [[David Puttnam]], the film is about an American oil company representative who is sent to the fictional village of Ferness on the west coast of Scotland to purchase the town and surrounding property for his company. For his work on the film, Forsyth won the 1984 [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]]. \n\nA stage musical adaptation received its world premiere in 2019 alongside a [[Criterion Collection]] DVD/Blu-ray release in September.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/28709-local-hero Criterion Collection]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\"Mac\" MacIntyre ([[Peter Riegert]]) is a typical 1980s hot-shot executive working for Knox Oil and Gas in [[Houston, Texas]]. The eccentric chief of the company, Felix Happer ([[Burt Lancaster]]), chooses to send him (largely because his surname sounds Scottish) to Scotland to acquire the village of Ferness to make way for a refinery. Mac (who is actually of Hungarian extraction) is a little apprehensive about his assignment, complaining to a co-worker that he would much rather take care of business over the phone and via [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] machines. Happer, an avid astronomy buff, tells Mac to watch the sky, especially around the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and to notify him immediately if he sees anything unusual.\n\nUpon arriving in Scotland, Mac teams up with local Knox representative Danny Oldsen ([[Peter Capaldi]]). During a visit to a Knox research facility in [[Aberdeen]], Dr Geddes ([[Rikki Fulton]]) and his assistant Watt ([[Alex Norton]]) inform them about the scope of the company's plans, which entail replacing Ferness with the refinery. They also meet (and admire) marine researcher Marina ([[Jenny Seagrove]]).\n\nMac ultimately spends several weeks in Ferness, gradually adapting to the slower-paced life and getting to know the eccentric residents, most notably the hotel owner and accountant, Gordon Urquhart ([[Denis Lawson]]) and his wife, Stella ([[Jennifer Black]]). As time passes, Mac becomes more and more conflicted as he presses to close the deal that will spell the end of the quaint little village he has come to love. Unbeknownst to him, however, the villagers are tired of their hard life and are more than eager to sell, though they feign indifference to induce a larger offer. Mac receives encouragement from an unlikely source: Victor (Christopher Rozycki), a capitalistic [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fishing boat captain who periodically visits his friends in Ferness (and checks on his investment portfolio, managed by Gordon).\n\nMeanwhile, Danny befriends Marina, who is under the impression the company is planning to build a research centre at Ferness. During a date, he discovers that Marina, who seems more at home in the water than on land, has [[webbed toes]]. While watching some grey seals, Danny mentions that sailors used to believe they were [[mermaid]]s. Marina tells him the sailors were wrong.\n\nAs the deal nears completion, Gordon discovers that Ben Knox ([[Fulton Mackay]]), an old [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] who lives in a driftwood shack on the shore, owns the beach through a grant from the [[Lord of the Isles]] to his ancestor. MacIntyre tries everything to entice Ben to sell, even offering enough money to buy any other beach in the world, but the owner is content with what he has. Ben picks up some sand and offers to sell for the same number of \"pound notes\" as he has grains of sand in his hand. A suspicious MacIntyre declines, only to be told there could not have been more than ten thousand grains.\n\nHapper finally arrives on site, just in time to unknowingly forestall a potential confrontation between some of the villagers and Ben. When Mac informs him of the snag in the proceedings, he decides to negotiate personally with Ben and, in the process, discovers a kindred spirit. Happer opts to locate the refinery offshore and set up an astronomical observatory instead. He instructs MacIntyre to go home to implement the changes. Danny brings up Marina's dream of an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research facility and suggests combining the two into the \"Happer Institute\", an idea that Happer likes. A sombre MacIntyre returns to his apartment in Houston, he pulls from his pocket pebbles and shells and spreads them out on the work surface. The local phone box in Ferness starts ringing as Mark Knopfler's \"Going Home\" begins playing and the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Mac\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Felix Happer\n* [[Fulton Mackay]] as Ben Knox\n* [[Denis Lawson]] as Gordon Urquhart\n* Norman Chancer as Moritz\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Danny Oldsen\n* [[Rikki Fulton]] as Geddes\n* [[Alex Norton]] as Watt\n* [[Jenny Seagrove]] as Marina\n* [[Jennifer Black]] as Stella\n* Christopher Rozycki as Victor\n* [[Gyearbuor Asante|Christopher Asante]] as Reverend Macpherson\n* [[John Gordon Sinclair]] as Ricky\n* Caroline Guthrie as Pauline\n* [[John M. Jackson]] as Cal (as John Jackson)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDavid Puttnam originally approached his regular backers [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Goldcrest Films]] to fund ''Local Hero'', but they initially turned him down. When Puttnam won a [[BAFTA]] (which was presented by Burt Lancaster) for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' in 1982 this immediately convinced Goldcrest executives to fund the movie.\n\nGoldcrest decided to finance the entire film. Warner Bros agreed to pay $1.5 million for US rights.<ref name=\"jake\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nPuttnam always wanted Burt Lancaster to play Happer but the casting proved problematic because the Hollywood star wanted his $2m salary, which was almost a third of the film's entire budget. However, upon learning of Lancaster's potential involvement in the project, [[Warner Bros.]] offered Puttnam a US distribution deal and provided the additional funding to secure Lancaster. After negotiations, Puttnam ended up having an additional $200,000 in the film's budget. He later remarked in an interview that \"big stars are not a liability, they are an asset!\".\n\n[[Michael Douglas]] and [[Henry Winkler]] both actively pursued Bill Forsyth for the role of MacIntyre (which ultimately went to [[Peter Riegert]]).\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Pennan Village 01072008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pennan]], [[Aberdeenshire]], which featured as the fictional village of Ferness]]\n[[File:Camusdarach Beach, near Morar - geograph.org.uk - 58018.jpg|right|thumb|Camusdarach, [[Morar]], near [[Mallaig]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], as the beach at Ferness]]\n''Local Hero'' was filmed in several locations around Scotland.

He gave particular praise to writer-director Bill Forsyth for his abilities as a storyteller.\n\n{{quote|What makes this material really work is the low-key approach of the writer-director, Bill Forsyth, who also made the charming ''Gregory's Girl'' and has the patience to let his characters gradually reveal themselves to the camera.

written and directed by [[Bill Forsyth]] and starring [[Peter Riegert]], [[Denis Lawson]], [[Fulton Mackay]] and [[Burt Lancaster]]. Produced by [[David Puttnam]], the film is about an American oil company representative who is sent to the fictional village of Ferness on the west coast of Scotland to purchase the town and surrounding property for his company. For his work on the film, Forsyth won the 1984 [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]]. \n\nA stage musical adaptation received its world premiere in 2019 alongside a [[Criterion Collection]] DVD/Blu-ray release in September.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/28709-local-hero Criterion Collection]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\"Mac\" MacIntyre ([[Peter Riegert]]) is a typical 1980s hot-shot executive working for Knox Oil and Gas in [[Houston, Texas]]. The eccentric chief of the company, Felix Happer ([[Burt Lancaster]]), chooses to send him (largely because his surname sounds Scottish) to Scotland to acquire the village of Ferness to make way for a refinery. Mac (who is actually of Hungarian extraction) is a little apprehensive about his assignment, complaining to a co-worker that he would much rather take care of business over the phone and via [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] machines. Happer, an avid astronomy buff, tells Mac to watch the sky, especially around the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and to notify him immediately if he sees anything unusual.\n\nUpon arriving in Scotland, Mac teams up with local Knox representative Danny Oldsen ([[Peter Capaldi]]). During a visit to a Knox research facility in [[Aberdeen]], Dr Geddes ([[Rikki Fulton]]) and his assistant Watt ([[Alex Norton]]) inform them about the scope of the company's plans, which entail replacing Ferness with the refinery. They also meet (and admire) marine researcher Marina ([[Jenny Seagrove]]).\n\nMac ultimately spends several weeks in Ferness, gradually adapting to the slower-paced life and getting to know the eccentric residents, most notably the hotel owner and accountant, Gordon Urquhart ([[Denis Lawson]]) and his wife, Stella ([[Jennifer Black]]). As time passes, Mac becomes more and more conflicted as he presses to close the deal that will spell the end of the quaint little village he has come to love. Unbeknownst to him, however, the villagers are tired of their hard life and are more than eager to sell, though they feign indifference to induce a larger offer. Mac receives encouragement from an unlikely source: Victor (Christopher Rozycki), a capitalistic [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fishing boat captain who periodically visits his friends in Ferness (and checks on his investment portfolio, managed by Gordon).\n\nMeanwhile, Danny befriends Marina, who is under the impression the company is planning to build a research centre at Ferness. During a date, he discovers that Marina, who seems more at home in the water than on land, has [[webbed toes]]. While watching some grey seals, Danny mentions that sailors used to believe they were [[mermaid]]s. Marina tells him the sailors were wrong.\n\nAs the deal nears completion, Gordon discovers that Ben Knox ([[Fulton Mackay]]), an old [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] who lives in a driftwood shack on the shore, owns the beach through a grant from the [[Lord of the Isles]] to his ancestor. MacIntyre tries everything to entice Ben to sell, even offering enough money to buy any other beach in the world, but the owner is content with what he has. Ben picks up some sand and offers to sell for the same number of \"pound notes\" as he has grains of sand in his hand. A suspicious MacIntyre declines, only to be told there could not have been more than ten thousand grains.\n\nHapper finally arrives on site, just in time to unknowingly forestall a potential confrontation between some of the villagers and Ben. When Mac informs him of the snag in the proceedings, he decides to negotiate personally with Ben and, in the process, discovers a kindred spirit. Happer opts to locate the refinery offshore and set up an astronomical observatory instead. He instructs MacIntyre to go home to implement the changes. Danny brings up Marina's dream of an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research facility and suggests combining the two into the \"Happer Institute\", an idea that Happer likes. A sombre MacIntyre returns to his apartment in Houston, he pulls from his pocket pebbles and shells and spreads them out on the work surface. The local phone box in Ferness starts ringing as Mark Knopfler's \"Going Home\" begins playing and the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Mac\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Felix Happer\n* [[Fulton Mackay]] as Ben Knox\n* [[Denis Lawson]] as Gordon Urquhart\n* Norman Chancer as Moritz\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Danny Oldsen\n* [[Rikki Fulton]] as Geddes\n* [[Alex Norton]] as Watt\n* [[Jenny Seagrove]] as Marina\n* [[Jennifer Black]] as Stella\n* Christopher Rozycki as Victor\n* [[Gyearbuor Asante|Christopher Asante]] as Reverend Macpherson\n* [[John Gordon Sinclair]] as Ricky\n* Caroline Guthrie as Pauline\n* [[John M.

When Puttnam won a [[BAFTA]] (which was presented by Burt Lancaster) for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' in 1982 this immediately convinced Goldcrest executives to fund the movie.\n\nGoldcrest decided to finance the entire film. Warner Bros agreed to pay $1.5 million for US rights.<ref name=\"jake\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nPuttnam always wanted Burt Lancaster to play Happer but the casting proved problematic because the Hollywood star wanted his $2m salary, which was almost a third of the film's entire budget. However, upon learning of Lancaster's potential involvement in the project, [[Warner Bros.]] offered Puttnam a US distribution deal and provided the additional funding to secure Lancaster. After negotiations, Puttnam ended up having an additional $200,000 in the film's budget. He later remarked in an interview that \"big stars are not a liability, they are an asset!\".\n\n[[Michael Douglas]] and [[Henry Winkler]] both actively pursued Bill Forsyth for the role of MacIntyre (which ultimately went to [[Peter Riegert]]).\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Pennan Village 01072008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pennan]], [[Aberdeenshire]], which featured as the fictional village of Ferness]]\n[[File:Camusdarach Beach, near Morar - geograph.org.uk - 58018.jpg|right|thumb|Camusdarach, [[Morar]], near [[Mallaig]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], as the beach at Ferness]]\n''Local Hero'' was filmed in several locations around Scotland.

Some of the payoffs in this film are sly and subtle, and others generate big laughs.

A few lines go by and the phone rings again, and the conversation once more rewinds and restarts, yet again changing focus. This pattern of rewinding and restarting the conversation in a different vein continues throughout the play whenever the unseen telephone rings. This convention is similar to the bell ringing in Ives's previous work ''Sure Thing'' (one of six plays in the collection ''[[All in the Timing]]''). As the play progresses the audience learns that the couple is in a tenuous state in their relationship and the happiness seen as the play opens is not the prevalent mood. Ruth is [[Jewish]]; Jack is a former [[Catholic]]. Ruth believes in hard work and success; Jack is lazy and has no goals. Ruth desperately wants to be married; Jack hates the idea of marriage. With each ring of the phone, the love affair dissolves into a more intense argument about religion, the future or marriage; however, this does not prevent a build-up of hope with each ring that perhaps the couple may work out their differences and come to an agreement.

As the lights come up Ruth and Jack, a couple in their mid-thirties, are dancing in their apartment. The telephone rings again, the couple stops, the music backs up a few measures and they begin to dance. Ruth and Jack dance on and converse about what a good time they are having; after a few lines the telephone rings, the music backs up a few measures and the conversation also goes back a few lines and this time changes direction.

If you liked [2007's] ''[[The Last Kind Words]]'', this is like that on steroids and crank, driving a Buick Skylark 200 miles an hour straight to Vegas.\u201d \u201cI felt like I was waking up and experiencing a moment of clarity that brought out all these pissed off, negative emotions,\u201d Fafara said of making the album. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-out release of pain. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beast of a year and a half, and it\u2019s still going,\u201d he added. Regarding the new album's musical direction, drummer John Boecklin stated, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me \u2014 it\u2019s not the fastest shit we have done, nor the slowest, [but it] just [has] lots of groove. But to me, when people say \u2018it\u2019s got groove,\u2019 I think it's a nice way of saying simple and boring these days. We wanted to avoid this. \u201cOur record has a great contrast of dark riffs, stomp bouncing drums with the right amount of blasts and double bass, and outstanding vocal delivery from Dez that takes it past your average approach of the metal attempt. I\u2019m not talking about reinventing the wheel or nothing. I just think our new album sits in its own corner from any of our other albums.\u201d \nThe band recorded 14 songs during the ''Beast'' sessions, with 12 tracks making the standard version of the CD and all 14 songs appearing on the special edition.\n\nThe special edition also includes the band's documentary ''You May Know Us from the Stage'' and official music videos spanning [[DevilDriver]]'s career thus far.\n\n==Promotion and release==\nThe first single \"Dead to Rights\" was released January 10, 2011.\n\nThe online Beast E-Team created by Daniel Wells and Sean Smith was mostly responsible for crashing Roadrunner Records systems on Monday, January 10, 2011, when the first single \"Dead to Rights\" was released for download.\n\nA second track, \"Coldblooded\" was posted on the 28 January.\n\nOn 31 January, a new track \"Bring the Fight (To the Floor)\" was posted though Revolver magazine as a \"Revolver Bootleg series\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/music/detail/exclusive-devildriver-premiere-bring-the-fight-to-the-floor-off-new-al/|title=Revolver Magazine|website=Revolvermag.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203190647/http://www.revolvermag.com/music/detail/exclusive-devildriver-premiere-bring-the-fight-to-the-floor-off-new-al|archive-date=3 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Revolver also interviewed [[Dez Fafara]] about the song, and this is what he said:\n\n\"Two things, really.

If you liked [2007's] ''[[The Last Kind Words]]'', this is like that on steroids and crank, driving a Buick Skylark 200 miles an hour straight to Vegas.\u201d \u201cI felt like I was waking up and experiencing a moment of clarity that brought out all these pissed off, negative emotions,\u201d Fafara said of making the album. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-out release of pain. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beast of a year and a half, and it\u2019s still going,\u201d he added. Regarding the new album\u2019s musical direction, drummer John Boecklin stated, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me \u2014 it\u2019s not the fastest shit we have done, nor the slowest, [but it] just [has] lots of groove. But to me, when people say \u2018it\u2019s got groove,\u2019 I think it\u2019s a nice way of saying simple and boring these days. We wanted to avoid this. \u201cOur record has a great contrast of dark riffs, stomp bouncing drums with the right amount of blasts and double bass, and outstanding vocal delivery from Dez that takes it past your average approach of the metal attempt. I\u2019m not talking about reinventing the wheel or nothing. I just think our new album sits in its own corner from any of our other albums.\u201d \nThe band recorded 14 songs during the ''Beast'' sessions, with 12 tracks making the standard version of the CD and all 14 songs appearing on the special edition.\n\nThe special edition also includes the band's documentary ''You May Know Us from the Stage'' and official music videos spanning [[DevilDriver]]'s career thus far.\n\n==Promotion and release==\nThe first single \"Dead to Rights\" was released January 10, 2011.\n\nThe online Beast E-Team created by Daniel Wells and Sean Smith was mostly responsible for crashing Roadrunner Records systems on Monday, January 10, 2011, when the first single \"Dead to Rights\" was released for download.\n\nA second track, \"Coldblooded\" was posted on the 28 January.\n\nOn 31 January, a new track \"Bring the Fight (To the Floor)\" was posted though Revolver magazine as a \"Revolver Bootleg series\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/music/detail/exclusive-devildriver-premiere-bring-the-fight-to-the-floor-off-new-al/|title=Revolver Magazine|website=Revolvermag.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203190647/http://www.revolvermag.com/music/detail/exclusive-devildriver-premiere-bring-the-fight-to-the-floor-off-new-al|archive-date=3 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Revolver also interviewed [[Dez Fafara]] about the song, and this is what he said:\n\n\"Two things, really.
