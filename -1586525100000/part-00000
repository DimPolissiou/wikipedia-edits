{{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[San Francisco]] via the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and 52 miles from [[Napa Valley]]. The population was 13,903 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nMill Valley is located on the western and northern shores of [[Richardson Bay]], and the eastern slopes of [[Mount Tamalpais]]. Beyond the flat coastal area and marshlands, it occupies narrow wooded [[canyon]]s, mostly of second-growth [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwoods]], on the southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais. The Mill Valley 94941 [[ZIP Code]] also includes the following adjacent unincorporated communities: Almonte, [[Alto, California|Alto]], [[Tamalpais-Homestead Valley, California|Homestead Valley, Tamalpais Valley]], and [[Strawberry, Marin County, California|Strawberry]]. The [[Muir Woods National Monument]] is also located just outside the city limits.\n\n==History==\n\n===Coast Miwok===\nThe first people known to inhabit Marin County, the [[Coast Miwok]], arrived approximately 6,000 years ago. The territory of the Coast Miwok included all of Marin County, north to Bodega Bay and southern Sonoma County. More than 600 village sites have been identified, including 14 sites in the Mill Valley area. Nearby archaeological discoveries include the rock carvings and grinding sites on [[Ring Mountain (California)|Ring Mountain]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=19244  ''Ring Mountain'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]\n</ref> The pre-[[Spanish missions in California|Missionization]] population of the Coast Miwok is estimated to be between 1,500 (Alfred L. Kroeber's estimate for the year 1770 A.D.)<ref>Kroeber, Alfred L. 1925. Handbook of the Indians of California. Washington, D.C: Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin No. 78. (Chapter 30, The Miwok); available at Yosemite Online Library</ref> to 2,000 (Sherburne F. Cook's estimate for the same year<ref name=\"Cook, Sherburne 1976\">Cook, Sherburne. 1976. The Conflict Between the California Indian and White Civilization. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03143-1}}.</ref>). The pre-Missionization population of the Coast Miwok may have been as high as 5000. Cook speculated that by 1848 their population had decreased to 300, and down to 60 by 1880.  As of 2011 there are over 1,000 registered members of the [[Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria]] which includes both the Coast Miwok and the [[Southern Pomo]], all of whom can date their ancestry back to the 14 survivors original tribal ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gratonrancheria.com/ourpeople.htm |title=FIGR |publisher=Graton Rancheria |accessdate=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306224736/http://www.gratonrancheria.com/ourpeople.htm/ |archive-date=March 6, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"millvalleylibrary.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.millvalleylibrary.org/Index.aspx?page=532|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180602/http://www.millvalleylibrary.org/Index.aspx?page=532|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 21, 2011|title=Mill Valley Public Library : Oral Histories|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Mill Valley, on Locust Avenue between Sycamore and Walnut Avenues, there is now a metal plaque set in the sidewalk in the area believed to be the birthplace of [[Chief Marin]] in 1871; the plaque was dedicated on 8 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_12329056 |title=Birth of Marin's namesake marked in Mill Valley neighborhood |website=Marinij.com |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201144106/http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_12329056 |archive-date=February 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The village site was first identified by Nels Nelson in 1907 and his excavation revealed tools, burials and food debris just beyond the driveway of 44 Locust Ave. At that time, the mound was {{convert|20|ft|m}} high. Another famous Mill Valley site was in the Manzanita area underneath the Fireside Inn (previously known as the Manzanita Roadhouse, Manzanita Hotel, Emil Plasberg's Top Rail, and Top Rail Tavern, most of which were notorious [[Prohibition]]-era [[Speakeasy|gin joints]] and [[brothels]]) located near the intersection of [[U.S. Route 101]] and [[California State Route 1]]. Built in 1916, the \"[[blind pig]]\" [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] was outside the [[Dry county|dry]] limits of the city itself. Shell mounds have been discovered in areas by streams and along Richardson Bay, including in the Strawberry and Almonte neighborhoods.\n\nBeginning with the foundation of [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], commonly known as Mission Dolores, in 1776, the Coast Miwok of southern Marin began to slowly enter the mission, first those from Sausalito followed by those from areas we now know as Mill Valley, Belvedere, Tiburon and Bolinas. They called themselves the \"Huimen\" people.  At the mission they were taught the Catholic religion, lost their freedom, and three quarters died as a result of exposure to European diseases.  As a result of the high death rate at Mission Dolores it was decided to build a new Mission San Rafael, built in 1817. Over 200 surviving Coast Miwok were taken there from Mission Dolores and Mission San Jose, including the 17 survivors of the Huimen Coast Miwok of the Richardson Bay Area.

They took Miwok ancestral lands, divided them and gave them to Mexican soldiers or relatives who had connections with the Mexican governor.  The huge tracts of land, called [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] by the Mexican settlers, or [[Californio]]s, soon covered the area.  The Miwoks who had not died or fled were often employed under a state of [[indentured servitude]] to the [[Alta California|California land grant]] owners.  In 1834, the governor of Alta California [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]] awarded to [[John Reed (Early Californian)|John T. Reed]] the first land grant in Marin, [[Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio]].  Just west of that, [[Rancho Saucelito]] was transferred to [[William A. Richardson]] in 1838 after being originally awarded to Nicolas Galindo in 1835.William Richardson also married a well-connected woman; both he and Reed were originally from Europe. Richardson's name was later applied to [[Richardson Bay]], an arm of the [[San Francisco Bay]] that brushes up against the eastern edge of Mill Valley.  The Richardson rancho contained everything south and west of the [[Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio|Corte Madera]] and [[Larkspur, California|Larkspur]] areas with the [[Pacific Ocean]], San Francisco Bay, and Richardson Bay as the other three borders.  The former encompassed what is now southern Corte Madera, the [[Tiburon Peninsula]], and Strawberry Point.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jen Robinson |url=http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/lb/main/crm/maps/MarinRanchosMap.swf |title=Marin County Free Library &#124; My choice for leisure, learning, living |publisher=Co.marin.ca.us |date=2016-06-24 |accessdate=2017-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114181514/http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/lb/main/crm/maps/MarinRanchosMap.swf |archivedate=November 14, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reed old adobe house.jpg|thumb|right|225px|alt=Reed's adobe house c. 1890 after being destroyed by fire.|Reed's adobe house c. 1890 after being destroyed by fire.]] In 1836, John Reed married Hilaria Sanchez, the daughter of a commandante in the San Francisco [[Presidio]].

Shortly thereafter, he made several poor investments and wound up massively in debt to many creditors. On top of losing his [[Mendocino County]] rancho he was forced to deed {{convert|640|acre|km2}} Rancho Saucelito to his wife, Maria Antonia Martinez, daughter of the commandante of the Presidio, in order to protect her. The rest of the rancho, including the part of what is now Mill Valley that did not already belong to Reed's heirs, was given to his administrator [[Rancho Saucelito|Samuel Reading Throckmorton]]. At his death in 1856 at 61 years old, Richardson was almost destitute.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jen Robinson |url=http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/lb/main/crm/maps/sausalito.html |title=Marin County Free Library &#124; My choice for leisure, learning, living |website=Co.marin.ca.us |date=2016-06-24 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThrockmorton came to San Francisco in 1850 as an agent for an eastern mining business before working for Richardson.  As payment of a debt, Throckmorton acquired a large portion of Rancho Saucelito in 1853-4 and built his own rancho \"The Homestead\" on what is now Linden Lane and Montford Avenue.  The descendants of ranch superintendent Jacob Gardner continue to be active in Marin.  Some of the rest of his land was leased out for dairy farming to [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> A majority of the immigrants came from the [[Azores]]. Those who were unsuccessful at gold mining came north to the [[Marin Headlands]] and later brought their families.

His surname would later be applied to one of the major thoroughfares in Mill Valley. Richardson and Reed had never formalized the boundary lines separating their ranchos. Richardson's heirs successfully sued Reed's heirs in 1860 claiming the mill was built on their property. The border was officially marked as running along the [[Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio]] along present-day Miller Avenue. Everything to the east of the creek was Reed property, and everything to the west was Richardson land. It was Richardson's territory that would soon become part of Mill Valley when Throckmorton's daughter Suzanna was forced to relinquish several thousand acres to the San Francisco Savings & Union Bank to satisfy a debt of $100,000 against the estate in 1889.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.millvalleyhistoricalsociety.org/history-of-early-mill-valley.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011213052527/http://www.millvalleyhistoricalsociety.org/history-of-early-mill-valley.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2001|title=History of Early Mill Valley|date=December 13, 2001|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:MV-Blithedale-Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|225px|alt=Homes on Bigelow Avenue.|Homes on Bigelow Avenue]] \nIn 1873, San Francisco physician Dr. John Cushing discovered 320 \"lost\" acres between the Reed and Richardson boundaries between present-day Corte Madera Avenue, across the creek, and into West Blithedale Canyon. Using the [[Homestead Act]] he petitioned the government and managed to acquire the land.  Before his death in 1879 he had built a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]] in the peaceful canyon.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In [[Sausalito]] the [[North Pacific Coast Railroad]] had laid down tracks to a station near present-day Highway 101 at Strawberry. Seeing the financial advantages of a railroad his descendants then turned the hospital into the Blithedale Hotel after the land title was finally granted in 1884. The sanitarium was enlarged, cottages were built up along the property, and horse-drawn carriages were purchased to pick up guests at the Alto station. Within a few years, several other summer resort hotels had cropped up in the canyon including the Abbey, the Eastland, and the Redwood Lodge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=853|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914014949/http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=853|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 14, 2007|title=Pacific Sun Pacific Sun: Into the canyon (May 4, 2007)|date=September 14, 2007|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref> Fishing, hunting, hiking, swimming, horseback riding, and other activities increased in popularity as people came to the area as vacationers or moved in and commuted to San Francisco for work. Meanwhile, Reed's mill deforested much of the surrounding redwoods, meaning that most of the redwoods growing today are second- or third-growth. The King family (King Street) owned property near the Cushing land. One of its buildings was a small adobe house which is believed to have predated the King farm.<ref name=\"millvalleylibrary.org\"/> The Blithedale Hotel used it as a milk house. The adobe structure is still standing and connected to a house on West Blithedale Avenue; it is the oldest structure in Mill Valley.\n\nThe San Francisco Savings & Union Bank organized the Tamalpais Land & Water Company in 1889 as an agency for disposing of the Richardson land gained from the Throckmorton debt. The Board of Directors was President Joseph Eastland, Secretary Louis L.

The Great Fire raged for several days in early July and nearly destroyed the fledgling city.  It ravaged much of Mt. Tam (including the Tavern and 117 homes) and the city itself was spared only by a change in wind direction.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In October of that year, the Mt.

With the demise of the railroads came the introduction of local bus service. [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] moved into the former train depot in Lytton Square in October 1940.  In Sausalito, [[Marinship]] brought over 75,000 people to Marin, many of whom moved to Mill Valley permanently. At the height of the War, nearly 400 locals were fighting, including many volunteer firemen and government officials.  By 1950, 1 in 10 Mill Valleyans were living in a \"Goheen Home\". [[George C.

Marin County was hit with one of the worst [[drought]]s on record beginning in 1976 and peaking in 1977, brought on by a combination of several seasons of low rainfall and a refusal to import water from the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], instead relying solely on rain water from Mt.

is a city in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]], [[United States]], located about {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[San Francisco]] via the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and 52 miles from [[Napa Valley]]. The population was 13,903 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nMill Valley is located on the western and northern shores of [[Richardson Bay]], and the eastern slopes of [[Mount Tamalpais]]. Beyond the flat coastal area and marshlands, it occupies narrow wooded [[canyon]]s, mostly of second-growth [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwoods]], on the southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais. The Mill Valley 94941 [[ZIP Code]] also includes the following adjacent unincorporated communities: Almonte, [[Alto, California|Alto]], [[Tamalpais-Homestead Valley, California|Homestead Valley, Tamalpais Valley]], and [[Strawberry, Marin County, California|Strawberry]]. The [[Muir Woods National Monument]] is also located just outside the city limits.\n\n==History==\n\n===Coast Miwok===\nThe first people known to inhabit Marin County, the [[Coast Miwok]], arrived approximately 6,000 years ago. The territory of the Coast Miwok included all of Marin County, north to Bodega Bay and southern Sonoma County. More than 600 village sites have been identified, including 14 sites in the Mill Valley area. Nearby archaeological discoveries include the rock carvings and grinding sites on [[Ring Mountain (California)|Ring Mountain]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2008.

Kroeber's estimate for the year 1770 A.D.)<ref>Kroeber, Alfred L. 1925. Handbook of the Indians of California. Washington, D.C: Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin No. 78. (Chapter 30, The Miwok); available at Yosemite Online Library</ref> to 2,000 (Sherburne F. Cook's estimate for the same year<ref name=\"Cook, Sherburne 1976\">Cook, Sherburne. 1976. The Conflict Between the California Indian and White Civilization. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03143-1}}.</ref>). The pre-Missionization population of the Coast Miwok may have been as high as 5000. Cook speculated that by 1848 their population had decreased to 300, and down to 60 by 1880.  As of 2011 there are over 1,000 registered members of the [[Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria]] which includes both the Coast Miwok and the [[Southern Pomo]], all of whom can date their ancestry back to the 14 survivors original tribal ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gratonrancheria.com/ourpeople.htm |title=FIGR |publisher=Graton Rancheria |accessdate=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306224736/http://www.gratonrancheria.com/ourpeople.htm/ |archive-date=March 6, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"millvalleylibrary.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.millvalleylibrary.org/Index.aspx?page=532|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180602/http://www.millvalleylibrary.org/Index.aspx?page=532|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 21, 2011|title=Mill Valley Public Library : Oral Histories|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Mill Valley, on Locust Avenue between Sycamore and Walnut Avenues, there is now a metal plaque set in the sidewalk in the area believed to be the birthplace of [[Chief Marin]] in 1871; the plaque was dedicated on 8 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_12329056 |title=Birth of Marin's namesake marked in Mill Valley neighborhood |website=Marinij.com |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201144106/http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_12329056 |archive-date=February 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The village site was first identified by Nels Nelson in 1907 and his excavation revealed tools, burials and food debris just beyond the driveway of 44 Locust Ave. At that time, the mound was {{convert|20|ft|m}} high.

Built in 1916, the \"[[blind pig]]\" [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] was outside the [[Dry county|dry]] limits of the city itself. Shell mounds have been discovered in areas by streams and along Richardson Bay, including in the Strawberry and Almonte neighborhoods.\n\nBeginning with the foundation of [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], commonly known as Mission Dolores, in 1776, the Coast Miwok of southern Marin began to slowly enter the mission, first those from Sausalito followed by those from areas we now know as Mill Valley, Belvedere, Tiburon and Bolinas. They called themselves the \"Huimen\" people.  At the mission they were taught the Catholic religion, lost their freedom, and three quarters died as a result of exposure to European diseases.  As a result of the high death rate at Mission Dolores it was decided to build a new Mission San Rafael, built in 1817. Over 200 surviving Coast Miwok were taken there from Mission Dolores and Mission San Jose, including the 17 survivors of the Huimen Coast Miwok of the Richardson Bay Area.

They took Miwok ancestral lands, divided them and gave them to Mexican soldiers or relatives who had connections with the Mexican governor.  The huge tracts of land, called [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] by the Mexican settlers, or [[Californio]]s, soon covered the area.  The Miwoks who had not died or fled were often employed under a state of [[indentured servitude]] to the [[Alta California|California land grant]] owners.  In 1834, the governor of Alta California [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]] awarded to [[John Reed (Early Californian)|John T. Reed]] the first land grant in Marin, [[Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio]].  Just west of that, [[Rancho Saucelito]] was transferred to [[William A. Richardson]] in 1838 after being originally awarded to Nicolas Galindo in 1835.William Richardson also married a well-connected woman; both he and Reed were originally from Europe. Richardson's name was later applied to [[Richardson Bay]], an arm of the [[San Francisco Bay]] that brushes up against the eastern edge of Mill Valley.  The Richardson rancho contained everything south and west of the [[Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio|Corte Madera]] and [[Larkspur, California|Larkspur]] areas with the [[Pacific Ocean]], San Francisco Bay, and Richardson Bay as the other three borders.

Mill Valley is surrounded by hundreds of acres (hectares) of [[Mount Tamalpais|state]], [[Muir Woods|federal]], and [[Marin Headlands|county]] park lands.  In addition, there are many municipally maintained open-space reserves, parks, and coastal habitats which, when taken together, ensconce Mill Valley in a natural wilderness.\n\nMill Valley and the Homestead Valley Land Trust maintains many minimally disturbed wildland areas and preserves which are open to the public from sunrise to dusk everyday.

Winter lows rarely drop below freezing and summer highs rarely peak {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} with 90% of the annual rain falling in November through March. Wind speeds average lower than national averages in winter months and higher in summer, and often become quite gusty in the canyon regions of town. [[Fog|California coastal fog]] often affects Mill Valley, making relative humidity highly variable.  The wetter winter months tend to make for a more consistent daily relative humidity around 70-90% (slightly higher than US averages).  During the summer months, however, while the morning fog often keeps morning humidity normal, in a typical 70-80% range, by afternoon after the fog burns off, the humidity regularly plummets to around 30% as one would expect in this dry seasonal climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Mill-Valley-California.html |title=Mill Valley, California (CA 94941) profile: population, maps, real estate, averages, homes, statistics, relocation, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, moving, houses, news, sex offenders |website=City-data.com |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> \n{{Weather box\n|location = Mill Valley, California\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 79\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 87\n|Apr record high F = 96\n|May record high F = 102\n|Jun record high F = 110\n|Jul record high F = 111\n|Aug record high F = 106\n|Sep record high F = 106\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F = 87\n|Dec record high F = 77\n|year record high F = 111\n|Jan high F = 56\n|Feb high F = 61\n|Mar high F = 65\n|Apr high F = 71\n|May high F = 76\n|Jun high F = 82\n|Jul high F = 85\n|Aug high F = 84\n|Sep high F = 82\n|Oct high F = 75\n|Nov high F = 63\n|Dec high F = 56\n|year high F = 71\n|Jan low F = 41\n|Feb low F = 43\n|Mar low F = 44\n|Apr low F = 46\n|May low F = 49\n|Jun low F = 52\n|Jul low F = 53\n|Aug low F = 54\n|Sep low F = 53\n|Oct low F = 50\n|Nov low F = 45\n|Dec low F = 41\n|year low F = 48\n|Jan record low F = 20\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 27\n|Apr record low F = 31\n|May record low F = 23\n|Jun record low F = 39\n|Jul record low F = 41\n|Aug record low F = 40\n|Sep record low F = 37\n|Oct record low F = 30\n|Nov record low F = 26\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F = 18\n|Jan rain inch = 9.60\n|Feb rain inch = 9.10\n|Mar rain inch = 7.05\n|Apr rain inch = 2.56\n|May rain inch = 1.20\n|Jun rain inch = 0.24\n|Jul rain inch = 0.01\n|Aug rain inch = 0.12\n|Sep rain inch = 0.50\n|Oct rain inch = 2.33\n|Nov rain inch = 7.47\n|Dec rain inch = 7.29\n|year rain inch = 47.47\n|source 1 = http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/94941\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\nMill Valley is also affected by [[microclimate]] conditions in the several box canyons with steep north-facing slopes and dense forests which span the southern and western city limits, which, along with the coastal fog, all conspire to make many of the dense forested regions of Mill Valley noticeably cooler and moister, on average, than other regions of town.

While many of the characters are humans with [[superhuman strength]] and magical abilities, the cast also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals and [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] lifeforms.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the titular protagonist, [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]], her lover [[Tuxedo Mask]], and her guardians: Sailors [[Sailor Mercury|Mercury]], [[Sailor Mars|Mars]], [[Sailor Jupiter|Jupiter]], and [[Sailor Venus|Venus]]. They are later joined by [[Chibiusa]] (Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask's daughter from the future) and four more guardians: Sailors [[Sailor Pluto|Pluto]], [[Sailor Uranus|Uranus]], [[Sailor Neptune|Neptune]], and [[Sailor Saturn|Saturn]]. The series' antagonists include the [[Dark Kingdom]], the [[Black Moon Clan]], the [[Death Busters]], the [[Dead Moon Circus]], and [[Shadow Galactica]].\n\nTakeuchi's initial concept was a story called ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', in which Sailor V discovers her magical powers and protects the people of Earth. After the ''Codename: Sailor V'' manga was proposed for an anime adaptation, Takeuchi changed her concept to include ten superheroines who defend the galaxy. The manga's [[Sailor Moon (TV series)|anime]], [[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (2003 TV series)|live-action]], and [[Sailor Moon musicals|musical]] adaptations feature some original characters created by the production staff and not by Takeuchi.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Naoko Takeuchi]] initially wrote ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', a one-shot manga which focused on [[Sailor Venus]]. When ''Sailor V'' was proposed for an anime adaptation by [[Toei Animation]], Takeuchi changed the concept to include Sailor Venus as a part of a \"[[sentai]]\" (team of five) and created the characters of Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter.<ref name=\"McCarter\">{{cite web|last=McCarter |first=Charles |title=Public Interview with Takeuchi Naoko |work=EX: CLUSIVE |publisher=www.ex.org |url=http://www.ex.org/3.6/13-feature_takeuchi.html |format=Q & A Interview |accessdate=2006-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221051150/http://www.ex.org/3.6/13-feature_takeuchi.html |archivedate=2009-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Sailor Senshi\" comes from [[sailor fuku]], a type of Japanese school uniform that the main characters' fighting uniforms are based on, and the Japanese word ''senshi'', which can mean \"soldier\", \"warrior\", \"guardian\", or \"fighter\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bui Hoang |first1=Hai |title=Meaning of senshi in Japanese |url=http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-senshi.html |website=RomajiDesu Japanese dictionary |accessdate=29 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Takeuchi created the term by fusing English and Japanese words.

The tree lived alone on an island in a vast ocean on a faraway planet. The tree then created life and gave energy to its many children, until the children became greedy and fought each other until the planet was destroyed, with the tree and two small children, Ail and Ann, as the only survivors. The tree became weak and required energy to stay alive. Ail and Ann supply it with human energy to revive it but this stops working. The tree becomes angered and starts to injure those around it, killing Ann in the process. Sailor Moon uses her power to purify the Tree and resurrect Ann. Ali and Ann are left with a reborn tree in the form of a small sapling. The two of them leave Earth to live a better life with the Tree.\n\nThe Hell Tree was voiced in Japanese by [[Taeko Nakanishi]].

The Cardians are kept in cards until they are summoned by Ail. To summon them, Ail would hold up several cards, and Ann would pick one. The card would then rise into the air and Ail would play a tune on his flute which causes the Cardian to come alive.

Shadow Galactica is an organization of corrupted Sailor Guardians led by Sailor Galaxia, who devote themselves to stealing Star Seeds, the essence of sentient life, from inhabitants of the Milky Way. Their ultimate goal is to reorganize the universe as desired by Chaos, the ultimate antagonist of the series.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Luna, Artemis, and Diana===\nThe series includes three different cat characters who act as advisors to their respective owners. Each has the power of speech, and bears a crescent moon symbol on his or her forehead. The two older cats, Luna and Artemis, lived in the Moon Kingdom, millennia before the main plot, and acted as advisors to [[#Queen Serenity|Queen Serenity]]; the third, Diana, is much younger and was born on [[Earth]].<!--Don't mention here that she's their daughter; wait for her section.--> The cats serve as mentors and confidantes, and a source of information and new tools and special items. They are shown to have additional human forms, a deeper backstory, and an unrequited love or two. Although Luna takes the largest role of the three, Artemis was the first of the cats to appear; he figures prominently in ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', the manga series which preceded ''Sailor Moon''.\n\nIn Act 46 of the manga, the three are attacked by [[Sailor Tin Nyanko]], a false Guardian from their home planet Mau (named after the Chinese word \"\u8c93\", meaning \"cat\"). Artemis terms it a peace-loving world, but Tin Nyanko informs him that its people were wiped out by [[Sailor Galaxia]] after he and Luna left it. Tin Nyanko blasts all three of them on their crescent moon symbols, and they turn into ordinary cats, unable to speak. Later, as they care for the badly injured cats, [[#Princess Kakyuu|Princess Kakyuu]] tells Usagi that the three of them have powerful Star Seeds, as brilliant as Sailor Crystals. In Act 48, they are brought to the River Lethe and killed by [[Sailor Lethe]]. They are reincarnated at the end of the series along with everyone else.<ref group=note>Luna and Artemis return and give birth to Diana in the future.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|live-action series]], Luna and Artemis are portrayed as stuffed toys rather than real cats. Usually they are represented by a [[puppet]], though [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects are used for complicated scenes.\n\nWriter Mary Grigsby considers the cat characters to blend pre-modern ideas about feminine mystery with modern ideas such as the [[lucky cat]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lent|first1=John A.|title=Assorted Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning: Cute, Cheap, Mad, and Sexy|date=1998|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|isbn=9780879727796|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b0EJmrszhyQC&pg=PP9&vq=183#PPA195,M1|accessdate=28 January 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Luna====\n{{nihongo|Luna|\u30eb\u30ca|Runa}} is a [[black cat]] who is a devoted servant to Princess Serenity and advisor to her mother, Queen Serenity.

Parts of Luna's memory are suppressed so that she must find the Sailor Guardians.<ref name=\"vol2\"/>{{rp|Act 9}} She first encounters Usagi Tsukino and teaches her to become Sailor Moon, unaware that she is actually the reincarnated Princess Serenity. Luna also provides the Guardians with many of their special items. Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though it is initially on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets Usagi by giving her unsolicited advice. She also becomes good friends with Ami Mizuno. She and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, who is their daughter from the future. In ''Sailor Stars'', Luna also develops a crush on Kou Yaten, one of the [[#Sailor Starlights|Three Lights]].\n\nIn \"The Lover of Princess Kaguya\", a side-story of the manga, she falls in love with a human named Kakeru. This story was adapted in ''[[Sailor Moon S: The Movie]]'', and features Luna's first transformation into a human. She gets a [[common cold|cold]] and tries to find her way home despite Artemis' plea to go with her. She ends up lying in the street until Kakeru saves her from becoming [[roadkill]].\n\nIn Act 27 of the live-action series, Luna gains the ability to turn into a young human girl, going by the name Luna Tsukino while able to become a Sailor Guardian known as \"Sailor Luna\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Luna Became a Sailor Senshi!|series=Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon|serieslink=Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|credits=[[Ryuta Tasaki]] (director); [[Yasuko Kobayashi]] (writer)|network=Toei|airdate=April 17, 2004|season=1|number=27}}</ref> She is shown living as a human with Usagi's family, with whom she gets along quite well, but still takes on her cat form when necessary. Her personality as a human girl is identical to her normal self and is easily overwhelmed by her feline nature, but she is also shown to have taken on some of the personality traits of Usagi and her mother, such as acting in the same melodramatic manner when waking up in the morning.

In addition, he is a good father to Diana, as evidenced by her affection for him.\n\nIn the original Japanese series, Artemis is voiced by [[Yasuhiro Takato]] in ''Sailor Moon'' and by Yohei Obayashi in ''Crystal''. In the live-action series, he is voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]. He appears in the first Sailor Moon musical, played by a cat-suited Keiji Himeno. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]]. In the [[Viz Media]] English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].\n\n====Diana====\n{{nihongo|Diana|\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30ca|Daiana}} is the future daughter of Luna and Artemis. She first appears when the Sailor Guardians travel to the 30th century in the Black Moon arc. After defeating Death Phantom, the Sailor Guardians return to the 20th century and Diana joins them. In the anime, she first appears in ''Sailor Moon SuperS'', calling Artemis her father, to Luna's initial dismay. Only later it is revealed that Diana has come from the future and that her mother is Luna. Just as Luna and Artemis guide Usagi and Minako, Diana acts as a guardian to [[Chibiusa]]. She is very curious, eager to help, and deeply polite, always addressing Usagi and Mamoru with the [[Japanese honorific]] {{nowrap|\"''-sama''\"}} and calling Chibiusa by her formal title, Small Lady. She is able to help the Sailor Guardians on occasion, despite her youth, and often because of the knowledge she had gained in the future.\n\nDiana is voiced by [[Kumiko Nishihara]] in the first series, and by [[Shoko Nakagawa]] in ''Crystal''. In the Cloverway English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Loretta Jafelice]] in the series, and by Naomi Emmerson in ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie]]''. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].\n\nIn one of her reviews of ''Sailor Moon Crystal'', [[IGN]] writer Meghan Sullivan admitted that the scene in which Diana tells Sailor Pluto to go and help Chibiusa and the Sailor Guardians while she guards the Door of Time and Space made her tear up, stating: \"Here was this tiny cat - who by her own admission has no powers and is too small to fight, offering to help however she could.

They come from the fictional planet {{nihongo|Kinmoku|\u30ad\u30f3\u30e2\u30af\u661f|Kinmokusei}}, whose princess, [[#Princess Kakyuu|Princess Kakyuu]], left the planet to escape [[Sailor Galaxia]]'s assault and to heal her wounds. The Starlights abandon Kinmoku and track Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where the Starlights disguise themselves as a male [[celebrity|pop star]] group called {{nihongo|The Three Lights|\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4|Sur\u012b Raitsu}} and embed their music with a telepathic broadcast in order to attract Kakyuu's attention. The Three Lights all attend J\u016bban High School along with Usagi and her friends. Eventually, on their way to the Galaxy Cauldron, they are killed by Galaxia's henchwomen [[Shadow Galactica|Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi]].\n\nIn the anime, the Starlights were given a major role. The trio are male in their civilian forms, becoming women when transforming into Sailor Guardians, as opposed to their manga counterparts who are women that disguise themselves as men in their civilian forms. As Starlights, they distance themselves from the other Sailor Guardians, deeming that Earth is not their responsibility. The Starlights survive several direct battles with Galaxia herself, and help Sailor Moon defeat Chaos to save Galaxia. Takeuchi expressed surprise at [[Toei Animation]]'s decision to make the Starlights lead characters in the anime adaptation, but was even more shocked by their treatment of the Starlights' sex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vallen |first1=Mark |title=Naoko Takeuchi: The creator of BISHOUJO SENSHI SAILORMOON speaks at the 1998 San Diego International Comics Convention |url=http://www.theblackmoon.com/Naoko/take.html |website=The Black Moon |accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> In the [[Italian language|Italian]] dub, instead of changing sex, there were six people \u2013 the Three Lights were always men, and simply summoned their twin sisters instead of transforming, as the original depiction was very controversial in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pellitteri|first1=Marco|last2=Yui|first2=Kiyomitsu|last3=Bouissou|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Di Fratta|first4=Gianluca|last5=Martorella|first5=Cristiano|last6=Suvilay|first6=Bounthavy|title=The Dragon and the Dazzle: Models, Strategies, and Identities of Japanese Imagination: a European Perspective|date=2010|publisher=Tunu\u00e9|location=Latina, Italy|isbn=9788889613894|page=424}}</ref>\n\nThe Starlights are featured in several of the [[Sailor Moon musicals|''Sailor Moon'' musicals]] (''Sailor Stars'', ''Eien Densetsu'', and their revised editions, plus ''Ryuusei Densetsu'' and ''Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin''). While played by women, it is meant to be ambiguous as to whether they take on male forms or cross-dress, though their personalities reflect the former. Their story also combines elements from both the manga and the anime; for instance, they travel to the Galaxy Cauldron as they do in the manga, but survive the battles against Galaxia as they do in the anime. The pairings with the Sailor Guardians from the anime are also featured in some musicals.\n\nTheir exact relationship to each other is unknown; according to the manga they are not siblings.<ref name=\"vol16\">{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon: Volume 16|date=1996|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788418}}</ref>{{rp|Act 44}} Their surname \"Kou\" (\u5149) translates to \"light\", among other things,<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Translate|url=https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E5%85%89|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref> making the name \"Three Lights\" a pun.

In general, Seiya acts arrogant and tends to be, at least on the surface, confident in his/her own abilities.\n\nSeiya becomes the star player of their local high-school [[American football]] team and the school's star athlete, upsetting [[Sailor Uranus|Haruka Tenoh]], who was the school's previous star athlete on the track and field team. Eventually, she raises the suspicions of the Sailor Guardians as to her identity.

In the end, when the enemy is defeated and he has departed on the back of the \"real\" Pegasus, Chibiusa thinks to herself that when she has grown up, he will become her \"prince\".<ref name=\"vol15\"/>{{rp|Act 42}}\n\nHelios is assisted by the {{nihongo|Maenads|\u30e1\u30ca\u30fc\u30c9|Menado}}, two priestesses who guard a shrine in Elysion. They escaped the Dead Moon Circus's curse by falling asleep. The Maenads eventually awaken and guide Chibiusa to Helios, and later appear along with the main characters after Nehelenia's defeat.\n\nIn the original anime adaptation's fourth season, ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS]]'', Helios guards the Golden Crystal that protects the sweet and beautiful dreams of Earth's people, as well as drawing more power and strength from those dreams. Nehelenia attacks him because she wants the Crystal for herself, so Helios leaves his own body to flee with the Crystal. Taking on the form of the mythical Pegasus, he places the Crystal on his forehead as a [[Alicorn|horn]] and hides in Chibiusa's dreams. There, he asks for her help and grants power to her and to her allies using several special items. Though he does not trust Chibiusa at first, they gradually develop a connection, and in the end he tells her his secrets by revealing his world of Elysion as well as his true form and name.\n\nIn the anime series, he is voiced by [[Taiki Matsuno]] in ''Sailor Moon''. In the Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Rowan Tichenor]] and in the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Chris Niosi]]. In the [[Sailor Moon musical|musicals]], Pegasus is voiced by Yuta Enomoto.<ref>1996 Sailor Moon Musical ''Sailor Moon Super S (Kaiteiban) Yume Senshi - Ai - Eien ni...

The series takes place in [[Tokyo]], Japan, where the {{nihongo|Sailor Guardians|\u30bb\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u6226\u58eb|S\u0113r\u0101 Senshi}}, a group of ten [[magical girl]]s, are formed to combat an assortment of antagonists attempting to take over the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]], and the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Each Guardian undergoes a transformation which grants her a uniform in her own theme colors and a unique [[classical element|elemental]] power. The ten Sailor Guardians are named after the planets of the Solar System, with the exception of Earth but including its moon. While many of the characters are humans with [[superhuman strength]] and magical abilities, the cast also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals and [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] lifeforms.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the titular protagonist, [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]], her lover [[Tuxedo Mask]], and her guardians: Sailors [[Sailor Mercury|Mercury]], [[Sailor Mars|Mars]], [[Sailor Jupiter|Jupiter]], and [[Sailor Venus|Venus]]. They are later joined by [[Chibiusa]] (Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask's daughter from the future) and four more guardians: Sailors [[Sailor Pluto|Pluto]], [[Sailor Uranus|Uranus]], [[Sailor Neptune|Neptune]], and [[Sailor Saturn|Saturn]]. The series' antagonists include the [[Dark Kingdom]], the [[Black Moon Clan]], the [[Death Busters]], the [[Dead Moon Circus]], and [[Shadow Galactica]].\n\nTakeuchi's initial concept was a story called ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', in which Sailor V discovers her magical powers and protects the people of Earth. After the ''Codename: Sailor V'' manga was proposed for an anime adaptation, Takeuchi changed her concept to include ten superheroines who defend the galaxy. The manga's [[Sailor Moon (TV series)|anime]], [[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (2003 TV series)|live-action]], and [[Sailor Moon musicals|musical]] adaptations feature some original characters created by the production staff and not by Takeuchi.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Naoko Takeuchi]] initially wrote ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', a one-shot manga which focused on [[Sailor Venus]]. When ''Sailor V'' was proposed for an anime adaptation by [[Toei Animation]], Takeuchi changed the concept to include Sailor Venus as a part of a \"[[sentai]]\" (team of five) and created the characters of Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter.<ref name=\"McCarter\">{{cite web|last=McCarter |first=Charles |title=Public Interview with Takeuchi Naoko |work=EX: CLUSIVE |publisher=www.ex.org |url=http://www.ex.org/3.6/13-feature_takeuchi.html |format=Q & A Interview |accessdate=2006-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221051150/http://www.ex.org/3.6/13-feature_takeuchi.html |archivedate=2009-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Sailor Senshi\" comes from [[sailor fuku]], a type of Japanese school uniform that the main characters' fighting uniforms are based on, and the Japanese word ''senshi'', which can mean \"soldier\", \"warrior\", \"guardian\", or \"fighter\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bui Hoang |first1=Hai |title=Meaning of senshi in Japanese |url=http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-senshi.html |website=RomajiDesu Japanese dictionary |accessdate=29 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Takeuchi created the term by fusing English and Japanese words.

While trying to blend in, Ail acts as Ann's brother. He develops a crush on Usagi, and constantly tries to win her over, much to Ann's dismay.

Ann develops a crush on Mamoru, and constantly tries to win him over, much to the dismay of Ail and Usagi.

The tree lived alone on an island in a vast ocean on a faraway planet. The tree then created life and gave energy to its many children, until the children became greedy and fought each other until the planet was destroyed, with the tree and two small children, Ail and Ann, as the only survivors. The tree became weak and required energy to stay alive. Ail and Ann supply it with human energy to revive it but this stops working. The tree becomes angered and starts to injure those around it, killing Ann in the process. Sailor Moon uses her power to purify the Tree and resurrect Ann. Ali and Ann are left with a reborn tree in the form of a small sapling. The two of them leave Earth to live a better life with the Tree.\n\nThe Hell Tree was voiced in Japanese by [[Taeko Nakanishi]]. In the DIC English adaptation, the Doom Tree was voiced by [[Elizabeth Hanna]]. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Erin Fitzgerald]].\n\n====Cardians====\nThe {{nihongo|Cardians|\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3|K\u0101dian}} are [[Villain of the week|monsters of the day]] used by Ail and Ann to obtain energy to revive the Hell Tree. The Cardians are kept in cards until they are summoned by Ail. To summon them, Ail would hold up several cards, and Ann would pick one. The card would then rise into the air and Ail would play a tune on his flute which causes the Cardian to come alive.

Shadow Galactica is an organization of corrupted Sailor Guardians led by Sailor Galaxia, who devote themselves to stealing Star Seeds, the essence of sentient life, from inhabitants of the Milky Way. Their ultimate goal is to reorganize the universe as desired by Chaos, the ultimate antagonist of the series.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Luna, Artemis, and Diana===\nThe series includes three different cat characters who act as advisors to their respective owners. Each has the power of speech, and bears a crescent moon symbol on his or her forehead. The two older cats, Luna and Artemis, lived in the Moon Kingdom, millennia before the main plot, and acted as advisors to [[#Queen Serenity|Queen Serenity]]; the third, Diana, is much younger and was born on [[Earth]].<!--Don't mention here that she's their daughter; wait for her section.--> The cats serve as mentors and confidantes, and a source of information and new tools and special items. They are shown to have additional human forms, a deeper backstory, and an unrequited love or two. Although Luna takes the largest role of the three, Artemis was the first of the cats to appear; he figures prominently in ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', the manga series which preceded ''Sailor Moon''.\n\nIn Act 46 of the manga, the three are attacked by [[Sailor Tin Nyanko]], a false Guardian from their home planet Mau (named after the Chinese word \"\u8c93\", meaning \"cat\"). Artemis terms it a peace-loving world, but Tin Nyanko informs him that its people were wiped out by [[Sailor Galaxia]] after he and Luna left it. Tin Nyanko blasts all three of them on their crescent moon symbols, and they turn into ordinary cats, unable to speak. Later, as they care for the badly injured cats, [[#Princess Kakyuu|Princess Kakyuu]] tells Usagi that the three of them have powerful Star Seeds, as brilliant as Sailor Crystals. In Act 48, they are brought to the River Lethe and killed by [[Sailor Lethe]].

Parts of Luna's memory are suppressed so that she must find the Sailor Guardians.<ref name=\"vol2\"/>{{rp|Act 9}} She first encounters Usagi Tsukino and teaches her to become Sailor Moon, unaware that she is actually the reincarnated Princess Serenity. Luna also provides the Guardians with many of their special items. Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though it is initially on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets Usagi by giving her unsolicited advice. She also becomes good friends with Ami Mizuno. She and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, who is their daughter from the future. In ''Sailor Stars'', Luna also develops a crush on Kou Yaten, one of the [[#Sailor Starlights|Three Lights]].\n\nIn \"The Lover of Princess Kaguya\", a side-story of the manga, she falls in love with a human named Kakeru. This story was adapted in ''[[Sailor Moon S: The Movie]]'', and features Luna's first transformation into a human. She gets a [[common cold|cold]] and tries to find her way home despite Artemis' plea to go with her. She ends up lying in the street until Kakeru saves her from becoming [[roadkill]].\n\nIn Act 27 of the live-action series, Luna gains the ability to turn into a young human girl, going by the name Luna Tsukino while able to become a Sailor Guardian known as \"Sailor Luna\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Luna Became a Sailor Senshi!|series=Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon|serieslink=Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|credits=[[Ryuta Tasaki]] (director); [[Yasuko Kobayashi]] (writer)|network=Toei|airdate=April 17, 2004|season=1|number=27}}</ref> She is shown living as a human with Usagi's family, with whom she gets along quite well, but still takes on her cat form when necessary. Her personality as a human girl is identical to her normal self and is easily overwhelmed by her feline nature, but she is also shown to have taken on some of the personality traits of Usagi and her mother, such as acting in the same melodramatic manner when waking up in the morning.

Artemis trains her to become Sailor V, and remains by her side when she takes on her proper role as Sailor Venus. He first guides Usagi Tsukino through the Sailor V video game at the Crown Game Center [[Amusement arcade|arcade]] without revealing his true identity.

In addition, he is a good father to Diana, as evidenced by her affection for him.\n\nIn the original Japanese series, Artemis is voiced by [[Yasuhiro Takato]] in ''Sailor Moon'' and by Yohei Obayashi in ''Crystal''. In the live-action series, he is voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]. He appears in the first Sailor Moon musical, played by a cat-suited Keiji Himeno. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]]. In the [[Viz Media]] English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].\n\n====Diana====\n{{nihongo|Diana|\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30ca|Daiana}} is the future daughter of Luna and Artemis. She first appears when the Sailor Guardians travel to the 30th century in the Black Moon arc. After defeating Death Phantom, the Sailor Guardians return to the 20th century and Diana joins them. In the anime, she first appears in ''Sailor Moon SuperS'', calling Artemis her father, to Luna's initial dismay. Only later it is revealed that Diana has come from the future and that her mother is Luna. Just as Luna and Artemis guide Usagi and Minako, Diana acts as a guardian to [[Chibiusa]]. She is very curious, eager to help, and deeply polite, always addressing Usagi and Mamoru with the [[Japanese honorific]] {{nowrap|\"''-sama''\"}} and calling Chibiusa by her formal title, Small Lady. She is able to help the Sailor Guardians on occasion, despite her youth, and often because of the knowledge she had gained in the future.\n\nDiana is voiced by [[Kumiko Nishihara]] in the first series, and by [[Shoko Nakagawa]] in ''Crystal''. In the Cloverway English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Loretta Jafelice]] in the series, and by Naomi Emmerson in ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie]]''. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].\n\nIn one of her reviews of ''Sailor Moon Crystal'', [[IGN]] writer Meghan Sullivan admitted that the scene in which Diana tells Sailor Pluto to go and help Chibiusa and the Sailor Guardians while she guards the Door of Time and Space made her tear up, stating: \"Here was this tiny cat - who by her own admission has no powers and is too small to fight, offering to help however she could.

They come from the fictional planet {{nihongo|Kinmoku|\u30ad\u30f3\u30e2\u30af\u661f|Kinmokusei}}, whose princess, [[#Princess Kakyuu|Princess Kakyuu]], left the planet to escape [[Sailor Galaxia]]'s assault and to heal her wounds. The Starlights abandon Kinmoku and track Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where the Starlights disguise themselves as a male [[celebrity|pop star]] group called {{nihongo|The Three Lights|\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4|Sur\u012b Raitsu}} and embed their music with a telepathic broadcast in order to attract Kakyuu's attention. The Three Lights all attend J\u016bban High School along with Usagi and her friends. Eventually, on their way to the Galaxy Cauldron, they are killed by Galaxia's henchwomen [[Shadow Galactica|Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi]].\n\nIn the anime, the Starlights were given a major role. The trio are male in their civilian forms, becoming women when transforming into Sailor Guardians, as opposed to their manga counterparts who are women that disguise themselves as men in their civilian forms. As Starlights, they distance themselves from the other Sailor Guardians, deeming that Earth is not their responsibility. The Starlights survive several direct battles with Galaxia herself, and help Sailor Moon defeat Chaos to save Galaxia. Takeuchi expressed surprise at [[Toei Animation]]'s decision to make the Starlights lead characters in the anime adaptation, but was even more shocked by their treatment of the Starlights' sex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vallen |first1=Mark |title=Naoko Takeuchi: The creator of BISHOUJO SENSHI SAILORMOON speaks at the 1998 San Diego International Comics Convention |url=http://www.theblackmoon.com/Naoko/take.html |website=The Black Moon |accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> In the [[Italian language|Italian]] dub, instead of changing sex, there were six people \u2013 the Three Lights were always men, and simply summoned their twin sisters instead of transforming, as the original depiction was very controversial in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pellitteri|first1=Marco|last2=Yui|first2=Kiyomitsu|last3=Bouissou|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Di Fratta|first4=Gianluca|last5=Martorella|first5=Cristiano|last6=Suvilay|first6=Bounthavy|title=The Dragon and the Dazzle: Models, Strategies, and Identities of Japanese Imagination: a European Perspective|date=2010|publisher=Tunu\u00e9|location=Latina, Italy|isbn=9788889613894|page=424}}</ref>\n\nThe Starlights are featured in several of the [[Sailor Moon musicals|''Sailor Moon'' musicals]] (''Sailor Stars'', ''Eien Densetsu'', and their revised editions, plus ''Ryuusei Densetsu'' and ''Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin''). While played by women, it is meant to be ambiguous as to whether they take on male forms or cross-dress, though their personalities reflect the former. Their story also combines elements from both the manga and the anime; for instance, they travel to the Galaxy Cauldron as they do in the manga, but survive the battles against Galaxia as they do in the anime. The pairings with the Sailor Guardians from the anime are also featured in some musicals.\n\nTheir exact relationship to each other is unknown; according to the manga they are not siblings.<ref name=\"vol16\">{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon: Volume 16|date=1996|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788418}}</ref>{{rp|Act 44}} Their surname \"Kou\" (\u5149) translates to \"light\", among other things,<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Translate|url=https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E5%85%89|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref> making the name \"Three Lights\" a pun.

In general, Seiya acts arrogant and tends to be, at least on the surface, confident in his/her own abilities.\n\nSeiya becomes the star player of their local high-school [[American football]] team and the school's star athlete, upsetting [[Sailor Uranus|Haruka Tenoh]], who was the school's previous star athlete on the track and field team.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The third test was played in Auckland at the Domain with a huge crowd of 24,300 present to see New Zealand go down 23-34<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Third League Test/Australia v New Zealand/Win for the Visitors/Score 34 Points to 23/Fast and Open Game\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17259\n| date = 1919-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190908.2.119\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. In September Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. \n\nIsles was playing for the Tauranga Football Club in the Jordan Cup competition for clubs and he also regularly appeared for the Tauranga representative team in Kusab Cup fixtures. His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.
