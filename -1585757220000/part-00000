He was an active executive member of the General Committee of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj since his college days. He participated in the committee's annual conferences at various locations across India, along with Brahmo leaders such as [[Keshub Chandra Sen|Kesub Chandra Sen]], [[Debendranath Tagore]], Sivanath Sastri, [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[R. G. Bhandarkar]], and others. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into [[Public service|government service]]. After that, he worked as a [[medic]] in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak. Gopalan extended his reform ideologies and propagated his reform activities by establishing Brahmo Samaj<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brahmoism; or, History of reformed Hinduism from its origin in 1830, |last=Bose, Ram Chandra.|date=1884|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls|oclc=1032604831}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brahmo-Samaj|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebrahmosamaj.net|title=brahmosamajnet|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebrahmosamaj.net/history/history.html|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adaniel.tripod.com/brahmosamaj.htm|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> on 17&nbsp;January 1898 at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. To conduct Samaj meetings and prayers, a separate Brahmomandir (hall), now the Ayathan Gopalan Memorial School, Calicut, was opened to the public on 17&nbsp;October 1900. The Brahmomandir was inaugurated by [[Zamorin of Calicut|Mana Vikraman Ettan Thampuran]], the Zamorin King<ref>{{Cite book|title=The zamorins of Calicut: from the earliest times down to A.D. 1806|last=Krishna Ayyar, K.

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which spread the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan initiated the Sugunavardhini Movement and began his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intending to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. Children were offered an opportunity to showcase their talents and skills, and were appreciated during these weekly meetings. Kausallyaammal, along with her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, united women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights.\n\nUnlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

He was an active executive member of the General Committee of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj since his college days. He participated in the committee's annual conferences at various locations across India, along with Brahmo leaders such as [[Keshub Chandra Sen|Kesub Chandra Sen]], [[Debendranath Tagore]], Sivanath Sastri, [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[R. G. Bhandarkar]], and others. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into [[Public service|government service]]. After that, he worked as a [[medic]] in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak. Gopalan extended his reform ideologies and propagated his reform activities by establishing Brahmo Samaj<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brahmoism; or, History of reformed Hinduism from its origin in 1830, |last=Bose, Ram Chandra.|date=1884|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls|oclc=1032604831}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brahmo-Samaj|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebrahmosamaj.net|title=brahmosamajnet|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebrahmosamaj.net/history/history.html|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adaniel.tripod.com/brahmosamaj.htm|title=brahmosamaj|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> on 17&nbsp;January 1898 at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which spread the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan initiated the Sugunavardhini Movement and began his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intending to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. Children were offered an opportunity to showcase their talents and skills, and were appreciated during these weekly meetings. Kausallyaammal, along with her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, united women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights.\n\nUnlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

Doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during Carson's presidential campaign. ''The Wall Street Journal'' attempted to verify Carson's account, reporting that Yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s, that Yale had offered no course called \"Perceptions 301\" at the time, and that Carson's photo had never appeared in the ''Yale Daily News''.<ref name=\"WSJ deeper questions\" /> Carson, while acknowledging the class number was not correct, said: \"You know, when you write a book with a co-writer and you say that there was a class, a lot of [the] time they'll put a number or something just to give it more meat.

Carson said other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination, but he alone finished the test. On doing so, Carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find \"the most honest student in the class\".
