A self-taught musician, he was influenced by the sound of natural rhythms around him. His drum patterns on Brown's recordings are considered [[funk]] standards. He recorded and toured with Brown for six years and settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], where he was a staple of the local music scene. Often uncredited, samples of his drum patterns were heavily used in [[hip hop music]]. He was the recipient of an honorary doctorate in fine arts.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn to Frank D. and Vena Stubblefield on April 18, 1943, he grew up in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Tennessee.<ref name=\"cs-dworld-bio\" /><ref name=\"cs-madison-feb2017\" /> He was inspired to pursue drumming after seeing drummers for the first time in a parade.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /> As a youngster his sense of rhythm was influenced by the industrial sounds of factories and trains around him.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> He practiced the rhythm patterns he heard, sometimes playing two patterns simultaneously.<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /> Years later he said if he could hum a drum pattern, he could play it.<ref name=\"cs-workshop-video\" /> He played professionally as a teenager and performed in local bands such as Blue Shufflers, Inclines, and Cascades.<ref name=\"cs-original-albumnotes\" /><ref name=\"cs-salon-2019\" /> In early 1960s he moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Georgia, and worked with guitarist [[Eddie Kirkland]] and toured with [[Otis Redding]].<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-paste-2014\" />\n\n==Drummer for James Brown, 1965 to 1970==\nIn 1965, [[James Brown]] saw Stubblefield perform in Macon, Georgia, and asked him to audition. Soon after he joined Brown's band.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /><ref name=\"cs-paste-2014\" /> Over the next six years the band had two drummers, Stubblefield and [[John \"Jabo\" Starks]] who had joined the band two weeks earlier. Starks' style was influenced by the tambourine thumbs notes on church music he grew up with in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama. The two drummers had no formal training.<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> According to Stubblefield, \"We just played what we wanted to play (...) We just put down what we think it should be.\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> The two \"created the grooves on many of Brown's biggest hits and laid the foundation for modern funk drumming in the process.\"<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" />\n\nStubblefield's recordings with James Brown are considered to be some of the standard-bearers for [[funk]] drumming, including the singles \"[[Cold Sweat]]\", \"[[There Was a Time]]\", \"[[I Got the Feelin']]\", \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\", \"[[Ain't It Funky Now]]\", \"[[Mother Popcorn]]\", \"[[Give It Up or Turnit a Loose]]\", \"[[Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved]]\" and the album ''[[Sex Machine (album)|Sex Machine]]''.<ref name=\"cs-bio-am\" /><ref name=\"cs-amoeblog-2010\" />\n\nHis rhythm pattern on James Brown's \"[[Funky Drummer]]\" is among the world's most sampled musical segments. It has been used for decades by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups and rappers such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Run-DMC]], [[N.W.A]], [[Raekwon]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and has also been used in other genres.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> Though the sole creator of his patterns, Stubblefield was not credited for the use of the samples.<ref name=\"cs-ind-lens-module\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> He was featured in the 2009 [[PBS]] documentary, ''[[Copyright Criminals]]'', which addressed the creative and legal aspects of sampling in the music industry.<ref name=\"cs-amoeblog-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-wired-2010\" />\n\n{{ external media|float=right|width=150px|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDXrN-90p0 Drum solo],<br/> Boston Garden 1968,<br/> \"Cold Sweat\"}}\n\n==Career, 1971 to 2017==\nStubblefield lived in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], from 1971 onward.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /> For over twenty years he played Monday nights with his band, The Clyde Stubblefield Band, in downtown Madison. The band featured his longtime friend and keyboard-organ player Steve \"Doc\" Skaggs, along with soul vocalists Charlie Brooks and Karri Daley, as well as a horn section and supporting band. Stubblefield retired from the Monday shows in 2011 due to health issues, leaving the band in the hands of his nephew Bret Stubblefield.<ref name=\"cs-isthmus-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-band-broadjam\" />\n\nStubblefield worked with a variety of musicians in the Madison area such as keyboardist Steve Skaggs, guitarists [[Luther Allison]] and Cris Plata, jazz violinist [[Randy Sabien]], country trio Common Faces and jazz group NEO.<ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /><ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-salon-2019\" /> He performed and recorded with members of [[The J.B.'s]] including [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Maceo Parker]] and \"Jabo\" Starks.<ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-sfweekly-2012\" /> The group released the album ''Bring the Funk on Down'' in 1999.<ref name=\"cs-am-bringfunk\" /> From the early 1990s to 2015, he performed on the nationally syndicated public radio show ''[[Whad'Ya Know?]]''<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-aaj-feb2015\" />\n\nStubblefield's first solo album ''The Revenge of the Funky Drummer'' was released in 1997. The album was produced by producer-songwriter [[Richard Mazda]].<ref name=\"cs-soloalbum1997-am\" /> In 2002, he released a 26 track [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|break-beat]] album titled ''The Original Funky Drummer Breakbeat Album''.<ref name=\"cs-bbeat-am\" /> Stubblefield's third solo album ''The Original'' was released in 2003.<ref name=\"cs-original-am\" /> All compositions were based on Stubblefield's drum grooves and the album was produced by [[Leo Sidran]].<ref name=\"cs-original-albumnotes\" />\n\nStubblefield collaborated frequently with \"Jabo\" Starks.

The album was released in 2008.<ref name=\"cs-ffya-2008\" /> Later that year an expansion to the [[EZdrummer]] software was released with samples recorded by Stubblefield and Starks.<ref name=\"cs-toon-2008\" />\n\nIn 2009, Stubblefield was in need of a kidney transplant and underwent dialysis treatments.<ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /> Musicians in the Madison area organized fundraiser events, donating the proceeds to supplement his dialysis treatment and subsequent medical bills.<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-moderndrummer-2007\" /> Stubblefield coped with health issues from the early 2000s onward including cancer. His wife Jody Hannon was a source of support in managing his health.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /><ref name=\"cs-confreaks-2012\" />\n\nIn 2011, Stubblefield performed \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\" on the ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|Jimmy Fallon show]]'' along with [[Chuck D]] and members of [[The Roots]] and [[Eclectic Method]].<ref name=\"cs-isthmus-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-imdb-2011\" /> In 2012, he gave an autobiographical talk and performed his favorite beats at the Madison Ruby conference in Madison, Wisconsin.<ref name=\"cs-rubycon-2012\" /> In 2015, a scholarship fund for music education was started and named after Stubblefield.<ref name=\"cs-scholar-isthmus2015\" /><ref name=\"cs-scholar-wsj2017\" />\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nIn 2014, Stubblefield was named the second best drummer of all time by ''[[LA Weekly]]''. According to the ''LA Weekly'', \"Stubblefield is one of the most sampled drummers in history, the man whose uncanny ability to deconstruct pop music's simple 4/4 rhythms into a thousand different sly syncopations laid the foundation not only for funk, but for most of hip-hop, as well.\"<ref name=\"cs-laweekly-jan2015\" /> In 2013, Stubblefield and Starks received the Yamaha Legacy Award.<ref name=\"cs-groovemaster-2013\" /><ref name=\"cs-yamaha-2013\" /> In 2004, he received the lifetime achievement award at the Madison Area Music Awards.<ref name=\"cs-mama-2004\" /> In 2000, he was inducted into the [[Wisconsin Area Music Industry]] hall of fame.<ref name=\"cs-wami-2000\" /> In 1990 he was named drummer of the year by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and in 2016 the magazine named Stubblefield and Starks the sixth best drummer of all time.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /><ref name=\"cs-rstones-2016\" /> A set of Stubblefield's autographed drum-sticks are in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" />\n\n[[Nerdcore hip hop|Nerdcore]] rapper [[MC Frontalot]] paid tribute to Stubblefield in his song \"Good Old Clyde\".<ref name=\"cs-hiphopbook-2015\" /> Hip hop artist [[Black Thought]] of [[The Roots]] rhymes \"I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James\" in the song \"Stay Cool\".<ref name=\"cs-bbc-roots-2004\" /> According to [[Questlove]], drummer of The Roots, Stubblefield is the one \"who defined funk music.\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> [[Chuck D]] said of Stubblefield's impact on hip-hop, \"It was a style of repetition that was emulated as opposed to just the actual sound. You know, holding it there, and keeping steady with the vamp.\"<ref name=\"cs-chuckd2017\" />\n\n[[Ben Sisario]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes: \"on songs like 'Cold Sweat' and 'Mother Popcorn' he perfected a light-touch style filled with the off-kilter syncopations sometimes called [[Ghost note|ghost notes]].\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> According to [[National Public Radio]], \"the grooves the two drummers (Stubblefield and Starks) created have inspired generations of artists \u2014 not just in funk, but in hip-hop, where their steady but intricate patterns make natural material for sampling.\"<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> In 2017, Stubblefield accepted an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], which was conferred posthumously.<ref name=\"cs-uw-feb2017\" /><ref name=\"cs-uw-degreelist\" /><ref name=\"cs-uw-degreepolicy\" />\n\n==Death==\nStubblefield died on February 18, 2017, from kidney failure.<ref name=\"cs-captimes-2017\" /><ref name=\"cs-billboard-2017\" /> He survived cancer in 2000 and coped with kidney disease since 2002.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /><ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> Pop icon [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who considered Stubblefield a drumming idol, was a major financial supporter and had paid for about $80,000 of the drummer's health care costs, it was disclosed in 2016, since Stubblefield had no health insurance.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> Stubblefield was survived by his wife Jody Hannon.<ref name=\"cs-billboard-2017\" />\n\n==Quotations==\nIn a 1991 interview with ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'', Stubblefield said: \"What influenced me mainly was sounds. Train tracks. Washing machines. I just put patterns against natural sounds, and that's what I do today. I could be walking down the street in time and put a drum pattern against it while I'm walking (...) That's the same thing I'm doing now when I sit down behind the drums. I put a pattern behind what everyone else is doing.\"<ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" />\n\n==Discography==\nCredits adapted from [[AllMusic]], except as noted.<ref name=\"cs-am-credits\" />\n\n===As

A self-taught musician, he was influenced by the sound of natural rhythms around him. His drum patterns on Brown's recordings are considered [[funk]] standards. He recorded and toured with Brown for six years and settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], where he was a staple of the local music scene. Often uncredited, samples of his drum patterns were heavily used in [[hip hop music]]. He was the recipient of an honorary doctorate in fine arts.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn to Frank D. and Vena Stubblefield on April 18, 1943, he grew up in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Tennessee.<ref name=\"cs-dworld-bio\" /><ref name=\"cs-madison-feb2017\" /> He was inspired to pursue drumming after seeing drummers for the first time in a parade.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /> As a youngster his sense of rhythm was influenced by the industrial sounds of factories and trains around him.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> He practiced the rhythm patterns he heard, sometimes playing two patterns simultaneously.<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /> Years later he said if he could hum a drum pattern, he could play it.<ref name=\"cs-workshop-video\" /> He played professionally as a teenager and performed in local bands such as Blue Shufflers, Inclines, and Cascades.<ref name=\"cs-original-albumnotes\" /><ref name=\"cs-salon-2019\" /> In early 1960s he moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Georgia, and worked with guitarist [[Eddie Kirkland]] and toured with [[Otis Redding]].<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-paste-2014\" />\n\n==Drummer for James Brown, 1965 to 1970==\nIn 1965, [[James Brown]] saw Stubblefield perform in Macon, Georgia, and asked him to audition. Soon after he joined Brown's band.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /><ref name=\"cs-paste-2014\" /> Over the next six years the band had two drummers, Stubblefield and [[John \"Jabo\" Starks]] who had joined the band two weeks earlier. Starks' style was influenced by the church music he grew up with in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama. The two drummers had no formal training.<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> According to Stubblefield, \"We just played what we wanted to play (...) We just put down what we think it should be.\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> The two \"created the grooves on many of Brown's biggest hits and laid the foundation for modern funk drumming in the process.\"<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" />\n\nStubblefield's recordings with James Brown are considered to be some of the standard-bearers for [[funk]] drumming, including the singles \"[[Cold Sweat]]\", \"[[There Was a Time]]\", \"[[I Got the Feelin']]\", \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\", \"[[Ain't It Funky Now]]\", \"[[Mother Popcorn]]\", \"[[Give It Up or Turnit a Loose]]\", \"[[Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved]]\" and the album ''[[Sex Machine (album)|Sex Machine]]''.<ref name=\"cs-bio-am\" /><ref name=\"cs-amoeblog-2010\" />\n\nHis rhythm pattern on James Brown's \"[[Funky Drummer]]\" is among the world's most sampled musical segments. It has been used for decades by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups and rappers such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Run-DMC]], [[N.W.A]], [[Raekwon]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and has also been used in other genres.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> Though the sole creator of his patterns, Stubblefield was not credited for the use of the samples.<ref name=\"cs-ind-lens-module\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> He was featured in the 2009 [[PBS]] documentary, ''[[Copyright Criminals]]'', which addressed the creative and legal aspects of sampling in the music industry.<ref name=\"cs-amoeblog-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-wired-2010\" />\n\n{{ external media|float=right|width=150px|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDXrN-90p0 Drum solo],<br/> Boston Garden 1968,<br/> \"Cold Sweat\"}}\n\n==Career, 1971 to 2017==\nStubblefield lived in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], from 1971 onward.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /> For over twenty years he played Monday nights with his band, The Clyde Stubblefield Band, in downtown Madison. The band featured his longtime friend and keyboard-organ player Steve \"Doc\" Skaggs, along with soul vocalists Charlie Brooks and Karri Daley, as well as a horn section and supporting band. Stubblefield retired from the Monday shows in 2011 due to health issues, leaving the band in the hands of his nephew Bret Stubblefield.<ref name=\"cs-isthmus-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-band-broadjam\" />\n\nStubblefield worked with a variety of musicians in the Madison area such as keyboardist Steve Skaggs, guitarists [[Luther Allison]] and Cris Plata, jazz violinist [[Randy Sabien]], country trio Common Faces and jazz group NEO.<ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /><ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-salon-2019\" /> He performed and recorded with members of [[The J.B.'s]] including [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Maceo Parker]] and \"Jabo\" Starks.<ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-sfweekly-2012\" /> The group released the album ''Bring the Funk on Down'' in 1999.<ref name=\"cs-am-bringfunk\" /> From the early 1990s to 2015, he performed on the nationally syndicated public radio show ''[[Whad'Ya Know?]]''<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-aaj-feb2015\" />\n\nStubblefield's first solo album ''The Revenge of the Funky Drummer'' was released in 1997. The album was produced by producer-songwriter [[Richard Mazda]].<ref name=\"cs-soloalbum1997-am\" /> In 2002, he released a 26 track [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|break-beat]] album titled ''The Original Funky Drummer Breakbeat Album''.<ref name=\"cs-bbeat-am\" /> Stubblefield's third solo album ''The Original'' was released in 2003.<ref name=\"cs-original-am\" /> All compositions were based on Stubblefield's drum grooves and the album was produced by [[Leo Sidran]].<ref name=\"cs-original-albumnotes\" />\n\nStubblefield collaborated frequently with \"Jabo\" Starks. As the '''Funkmasters''', the duo released an album in 2001 called ''Find the Groove'' and an album in 2006 called ''Come Get Summa This''.<ref name=\"cs-findgroove-am\" /><ref name=\"cd-summathis-am\" /> The duo also released a drumming instruction video in 1999 titled ''Soul of the Funky Drummers''.<ref name=\"cs-dworld-bio\" /><ref name=\"cs-instvideo-1999\" /> In December 2007, the duo joined Bootsy Collins in Covington, Kentucky, for the first tribute concert in memory of James Brown.<ref name=\"cs-tributeshow-2007\" /> Stubblefield and Starks played on ''Funk for Your Ass'', a tribute album by fellow James Brown orchestra alum [[Fred Wesley]]. The album was released in 2008.<ref name=\"cs-ffya-2008\" /> Later that year an expansion to the [[EZdrummer]] software was released with samples recorded by Stubblefield and Starks.<ref name=\"cs-toon-2008\" />\n\nIn 2009, Stubblefield was in need of a kidney transplant and underwent dialysis treatments.<ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /> Musicians in the Madison area organized fundraiser events, donating the proceeds to supplement his dialysis treatment and subsequent medical bills.<ref name=\"cs-vicfirth-2010\" /><ref name=\"cs-moderndrummer-2007\" /> Stubblefield coped with health issues from the early 2000s onward including cancer. His wife Jody Hannon was a source of support in managing his health.<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-madison-jul2009\" /><ref name=\"cs-confreaks-2012\" />\n\nIn 2011, Stubblefield performed \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\" on the ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|Jimmy Fallon show]]'' along with [[Chuck D]] and members of [[The Roots]] and [[Eclectic Method]].<ref name=\"cs-isthmus-2011\" /><ref name=\"cs-imdb-2011\" /> In 2012, he gave an autobiographical talk and performed his favorite beats at the Madison Ruby conference in Madison, Wisconsin.<ref name=\"cs-rubycon-2012\" /> In 2015, a scholarship fund for music education was started and named after Stubblefield.<ref name=\"cs-scholar-isthmus2015\" /><ref name=\"cs-scholar-wsj2017\" />\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nIn 2014, Stubblefield was named the second best drummer of all time by ''[[LA Weekly]]''. According to the ''LA Weekly'', \"Stubblefield is one of the most sampled drummers in history, the man whose uncanny ability to deconstruct pop music's simple 4/4 rhythms into a thousand different sly syncopations laid the foundation not only for funk, but for most of hip-hop, as well.\"<ref name=\"cs-laweekly-jan2015\" /> In 2013, Stubblefield and Starks received the Yamaha Legacy Award.<ref name=\"cs-groovemaster-2013\" /><ref name=\"cs-yamaha-2013\" /> In 2004, he received the lifetime achievement award at the Madison Area Music Awards.<ref name=\"cs-mama-2004\" /> In 2000, he was inducted into the [[Wisconsin Area Music Industry]] hall of fame.<ref name=\"cs-wami-2000\" /> In 1990 he was named drummer of the year by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and in 2016 the magazine named Stubblefield and Starks the sixth best drummer of all time.<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" /><ref name=\"cs-rstones-2016\" /> A set of Stubblefield's autographed drum-sticks are in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"cs-famusbook-2003\" />\n\n[[Nerdcore hip hop|Nerdcore]] rapper [[MC Frontalot]] paid tribute to Stubblefield in his song \"Good Old Clyde\".<ref name=\"cs-hiphopbook-2015\" /> Hip hop artist [[Black Thought]] of [[The Roots]] rhymes \"I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James\" in the song \"Stay Cool\".<ref name=\"cs-bbc-roots-2004\" /> According to [[Questlove]], drummer of The Roots, Stubblefield is the one \"who defined funk music.\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> [[Chuck D]] said of Stubblefield's impact on hip-hop, \"It was a style of repetition that was emulated as opposed to just the actual sound. You know, holding it there, and keeping steady with the vamp.\"<ref name=\"cs-chuckd2017\" />\n\n[[Ben Sisario]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes: \"on songs like 'Cold Sweat' and 'Mother Popcorn' he perfected a light-touch style filled with the off-kilter syncopations sometimes called [[Ghost note|ghost notes]].\"<ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> According to [[National Public Radio]], \"the grooves the two drummers (Stubblefield and Starks) created have inspired generations of artists \u2014 not just in funk, but in hip-hop, where their steady but intricate patterns make natural material for sampling.\"<ref name=\"cs-npr-2015\" /> In 2017, Stubblefield accepted an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], which was conferred posthumously.<ref name=\"cs-uw-feb2017\" /><ref name=\"cs-uw-degreelist\" /><ref name=\"cs-uw-degreepolicy\" />\n\n==Death==\nStubblefield died on February 18, 2017, from kidney failure.<ref name=\"cs-captimes-2017\" /><ref name=\"cs-billboard-2017\" /> He survived cancer in 2000 and coped with kidney disease since 2002.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /><ref name=\"cs-nytimes-2011\" /> Pop icon [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who considered Stubblefield a drumming idol, was a major financial supporter and had paid for about $80,000 of the drummer's health care costs, it was disclosed in 2016, since Stubblefield had no health insurance.<ref name=\"cs-prince-wsj\" /><ref name=\"cs-rollingstone-2017\" /> Stubblefield was survived by his wife Jody Hannon.<ref name=\"cs-billboard-2017\" />\n\n==Quotations==\nIn a 1991 interview with ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'', Stubblefield said: \"What influenced me mainly was sounds. Train tracks. Washing machines. I just put patterns against natural sounds, and that's what I do today. I could be walking down the street in time and put a drum pattern against it while I'm walking (...) That's the same thing I'm doing now when I sit down behind the drums. I put a pattern behind what everyone else is doing.\"<ref name=\"cs-isthmus2-2011\" />\n\n==Discography==\nCredits adapted from [[AllMusic]], except as noted.<ref name=\"cs-am-credits\" />\n\n===As

{"title_page": "List of attacks related to secondary schools", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of attacks related to secondary schools''' that have occurred around the world. These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Final 1.jpg|thumb|CDCR Special Service Unit agents making an arrest]]\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

On September 13, 1995 the court found the delivery of mental health care violated the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and issued an order for injunctive relief requiring defendants to develop plans to remedy the constitutional violations under the supervision of a [[special master]].\n\nFollowing the Governor's issuance of the State of Emergency Proclamation, the plaintiffs in ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' filed motions to convene a three-judge court to limit the prison population. On July 23, 2007 both the ''Plata'' and ''Coleman'' courts granted the plaintiff's motions and recommended that the cases be assigned to the same three-judge court.<ref name=\"MooreNYT\"/> The Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and, on July 26, 2007, convened the instant three-judge district court pursuant to {{usc|28|2284}}.\n\nAs of 2008\u201309 fiscal year, the state of California spent approximately $16,000 per inmate per year on prison health care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/handouts/crimjust/2010/Correctional_health_care_03_18_10.pdf|title=Overview of Adult Correctional Health Care Spending}}</ref> This amount was by far the largest in the country and more than triple the $4,400 spent per inmate in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/spe01.pdf|title=State Prison Expenditures, 2001}}</ref> The state with the second largest prison population in the country, Texas, spent less than $4,000 per inmate per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/uchealth/2010/05/20/prison-health-update/|title=Prison health update}}</ref>\n\n=='''Prison Escapes'''==\n\nThe number of prison escapes from California prisons is not officially published anywhere.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. This incident was documented in Joseph Wambaugh's bestseller, \"[[The Onion Field]].\"The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Final 1.jpg|thumb|CDCR Special Service Unit agents making an arrest]]\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.

It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt.

Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements.  Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from [[Combat Engineers]] are the skill sets.

Moreell's model.\n\nSince creation Seabees have received all their advanced military training from the Marine Corps.  As  such, it is strictly standard conventional warfare.  Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt.

Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.
