The [[Port of Skagen]] is Denmark's main fishing port and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 million people annually.\n\nOriginally the name was applied to the peninsula but it now usually refers to the town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its [[herring]] industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of [[impressionism|impressionist]] artists now known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. In 1879, the Skagen Fishermen's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the [[Skagensbanen]] railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.\n\nIn the early 1910s, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and [[Queen Alexandrine]] often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built the summer residence [[Klitgaarden]], completed in 1914.\n\nBetween the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a peak population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of 1 January 2019 it has a population of 8,003. Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller [[Skagen Designs]] have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen's restaurants.\n\n[[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by [[Skagen Church]] in 1841 designed by [[Christian Frederik Hansen]]. It was redeveloped in 1909\u201310 by [[Ulrik Adolph Plesner|Ulrik Plesner]] who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including [[Br\u00f8ndums Hotel]], [[Skagens Museum]], [[Michael and Anna Ancher House|Michael and Anna Ancher's House]], and [[Drachmann's House]].\n\nSkagen's first school was the ''Latinskole'', a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the [[Danish Folkeskole Education|public school]] ''Ankermedets skole'' was opened on Skagavej. The main gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen's Sportscenter was completed in 1974, primarily to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idr\u00e6ts Klub, was founded in 1946 and reached the Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in [[Football in Denmark|Danish football]], as their best position. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is {{convert|17| km|abbr=on}} south of the town.\n\n[[Skagen station]] is the most northerly railway station in Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. [[Nordjyske Jernbaner]] operates the local train service between Skagen, Frederikshavn and Aalborg with onward national connections by [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to [[Gothenburg]], [[Oslo]] and [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]]. [[Aalborg Airport]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Skagen.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Skagens tilsandede kirke.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The sand-engulfed Buried Church (''tilsandede kirke'') at Skagen.]]\nSkagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by [[Pliny the Elder]]:\n:\"Promenturium Cimbrorum excurrens in maria longe paeninsulam efficit quae Tastris appellatur\" (Book IV, 97)\n:\"The promontory of the Cimbri running far out into the seas makes a peninsula, which is called Tastris.\"\n\nThis is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself, first documented as ''Skaffuen'' in 1284, simply means narrow, high point of land<ref>[http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php Flemming Elimar Jensen, \"Hvad betyder bynavnene & landsdels navne?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091902/http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php |date=15 February 2015 }}, MiddelalderInfo. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.</ref><ref name=dsd/>\n\nThe first building in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in [[H\u00f8jen]] on the west side of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, a shepherd who also became Skagen's first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today's harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, [[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, [[Erik of Pommern]] granted Skagen the status of [[market town]] with the result that for a time it became [[Vendsyssel]]'s largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.<ref name=slf>[http://www.skagenlokal.dk/tidstavle.html \"Tidstavle\"], Skagen Lokalhistoriske Forening. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1549 a grammar school was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first lighthouse was constructed.

They were attracted by the scenery, the fishermen and the social community of their fellow artists which encouraged them to paint ''[[en plein air]]'' following the example of the French [[Impressionist]]s while sometimes adopting the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] approach of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon School]]. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.{{sfn|Svanholm|2001|pp=30-43}}\n\nThe group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle.

[[Denmark]]'s northernmost town, on the east coast of the [[Skagen Odde]] peninsula in the far north of [[Jutland]], part of [[Frederikshavn Municipality]] in [[North Denmark Region|Nordjylland]], {{convert|41|km}} north of [[Frederikshavn]] and {{convert|108|km}} northeast of [[Aalborg]]. The [[Port of Skagen]] is Denmark's main fishing port and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 million people annually.\n\nOriginally the name was applied to the peninsula but it now usually refers to the town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its [[herring]] industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of [[impressionism|impressionist]] artists now known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. In 1879, the Skagen Fishermen's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the [[Skagensbanen]] railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.\n\nIn the early 1910s, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and [[Queen Alexandrine]] often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built the summer residence [[Klitgaarden]], completed in 1914.\n\nBetween the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a peak population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of 1 January 2019 it has a population of 8,003. Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller [[Skagen Designs]] have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen's restaurants.\n\n[[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by [[Skagen Church]] in 1841 designed by [[Christian Frederik Hansen]]. It was redeveloped in 1909\u201310 by [[Ulrik Adolph Plesner|Ulrik Plesner]] who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including [[Br\u00f8ndums Hotel]], [[Skagens Museum]], [[Michael and Anna Ancher House|Michael and Anna Ancher's House]], and [[Drachmann's House]].\n\nSkagen's first school was the ''Latinskole'', a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the [[Danish Folkeskole Education|public school]] ''Ankermedets skole'' was opened on Skagavej. The main gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen's Sportscenter was completed in 1974, primarily to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idr\u00e6ts Klub, was founded in 1946 and reached the Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in [[Football in Denmark|Danish football]], as their best position. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is {{convert|17| km|abbr=on}} south of the town.\n\n[[Skagen station]] is the most northerly railway station in Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. [[Nordjyske Jernbaner]] operates the local train service between Skagen, Frederikshavn and Aalborg with onward national connections by [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to [[Gothenburg]], [[Oslo]] and [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]]. [[Aalborg Airport]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Skagen.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Skagens tilsandede kirke.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The sand-engulfed Buried Church (''tilsandede kirke'') at Skagen.]]\nSkagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by [[Pliny the Elder]]:\n:\"Promenturium Cimbrorum excurrens in maria longe paeninsulam efficit quae Tastris appellatur\" (Book IV, 97)\n:\"The promontory of the Cimbri running far out into the seas makes a peninsula, which is called Tastris.\"\n\nThis is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself, first documented as ''Skaffuen'' in 1284, simply means narrow, high point of land<ref>[http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php Flemming Elimar Jensen, \"Hvad betyder bynavnene & landsdels navne?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091902/http://www.middelalderinfo.dk/bynavne.php |date=15 February 2015 }}, MiddelalderInfo. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.</ref><ref name=dsd/>\n\nThe first building in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in [[H\u00f8jen]] on the west side of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, a shepherd who also became Skagen's first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today's harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, [[The Sand-Covered Church|St Lawrence's Church]] was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, [[Erik of Pommern]] granted Skagen the status of [[market town]] with the result that for a time it became [[Vendsyssel]]'s largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.<ref name=slf>[http://www.skagenlokal.dk/tidstavle.html \"Tidstavle\"], Skagen Lokalhistoriske Forening. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 10 October 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1549 a grammar school was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first lighthouse was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked off the coast of Skagen.<ref name=slf/> In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away.<ref name=slf/> In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand.<ref name=slf/> As a result, new housing was built in \u00d8sterby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.\n\n===17th\u201319th centuries===\n[[File:Skagenhaus 1.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Skagen house: red tiled roof with white trimmings, yellow-plastered walls and a white fence]]\nIn the 17th century, fishing suffered from a decline in herring stocks.

It was inaugurated on 20 November 1907,{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=24}} and later additions were made for cold storage and the fish processing industry. The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by [[Thorvald Bindesb\u00f8ll]].\n\nIn the early 1910s, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and [[Queen Alexandrine]] often visited Skagen in the royal yacht ''[[HDMY Dannebrog (1879)|Kongeskibet Dannebrog]]''. Occasionally they arrived by train and brought friends from other European monarchies and stayed at the Br\u00f8ndums and Grenen hotels. They grew fond of the place, befriending many of the artists in Skagen.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=25}} Christian X bought up land in the vicinity and built the summer residence [[Klitgaarden]] as a gift for his wife. Designed by Ulrik Plesner, with furniture provided by [[Marie Kr\u00f8yer]], the villa was inaugurated on 11 April 1914, with the town celebrating the royal opening with many flags.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=26}} Klitgaarden was further embellished inside by local artists. It passed to [[Prince Knud]] and [[Princess Caroline Mathilde]], and after Caroline's death in 1995, it was converted into a villa retreat for scholars in 2000.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=26}} Composer [[Carl Nielsen]] also frequented Skagen in his youth, and he purchased a plot of land on Vestre Strandvej at Vesterby in 1918 with his sculptor wife [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen]], using one of the two small half-timbered houses there as a residence and studio.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=26}} They named it \"Finis Terrae\", meaning \"end of the world\".

In 1931, the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town, commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to erect a {{convert|3|m}} bronze statue of a lifeboatman in garb, holding a lifeline.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=27}} The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931, before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=27}} In October 1938, lightning struck the Skagens Badehotel, affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms. During World War II, the hotel was taken over by the Germans, until it was demolished in 1943.{{sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=24}} Further facilities were developed in the 1950s. From the 1960s, housing estates were constructed to the north, forming a built-up area extending to H\u00f8jen. Anna and Michael Ancher's house was opened as a museum (1967) and the new town hall was completed in 1969.<ref name=dsd/><ref name=slf/> The [[Skagen Festival]] was founded in 1971, making it the oldest music festival in the country.

Kr\u00f8yer: ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'' (1888)]]\nThe [[Skagen Painters]] were a group of Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. They were attracted by the scenery, the fishermen and the social community of their fellow artists which encouraged them to paint ''[[en plein air]]'' following the example of the French [[Impressionist]]s while sometimes adopting the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] approach of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon School]]. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.{{sfn|Svanholm|2001|pp=30-43}}\n\nThe group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle. It encompassed not only painters, but also writers, and other influential people. While only a few were full-time residents of the area, they were often joined by family and friends, especially during the summer months. The group initially revolved around [[Michael Ancher]] and his wife to be [[Anna Ancher|Anna]], the only member of the group who was a native of Skagen. [[P.S.

It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Kr\u00f8yer in 1894, [[Laurits Tuxen]] in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903.<ref>Mona Jensen (editor), \"Danske kunstnerkolonier. Skagen. Fyn.

In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].

''[[The Guardian]]''. 24 September 2003.</ref>\n\nAlthough composed in 1965, ''The Likes of Us'' was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]]. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].

The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from \"Phantom of the Opera\" plays D, C#, C, B, A#, then ascending A#, B, C, C#, D.
