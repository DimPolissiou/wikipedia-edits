It has a rich history of local characters many of whom acquired their local knowledge and traditions from generations who have passed on. The area is located close to the Armagh border which provided an option for people to make a living during periods of economic recession also the Cashel and Tonagh bogs supplied a constant source of fuel to people for many years up to the late 1960s. Two lakes dominate the landscape in the townland, Lough Nahinch (The Island Lough) and Tassan Lough Natural Heritage Area both of which have been used by anglers for pike and perch fishing over the centuries.\n\n==History==\nTassan is located in the postal district of [[Clontibret]] where in 1595 in the adjacent countryside the [[Battle of Clontibret]] occurred. The territory of Monaghan had been wrested from the control of the MacMahon clan in 1591, when the clan leader was executed by English authority. Subsequent encroachments by the English into the province of [[Ulster]] led to the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595\u20131603). The battle was the earliest clash between the two sides, with the Irish led by [[Hugh \u00d3 Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] and the English by Sir Henry Bagenal. Although O'Neill won the battle, the war ended with the completion of the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English conquest of Ireland]]. In 1610 the [[Plantation of Ulster]] was established, an event that still defines certain political allegiances in the north of Ireland.\n\n===The Tassan Mining Company===\nThe Tassan Mining Company was established in the late 1840s and is recognised as one of the largest and most productive lead mines in County Monaghan. Total production was reported at 742 tonnes of ore, including 546 tonnes of lead and 37.478g of silver. The mineralization was hosted by two lodes each striking Northwest and dipping Eastwards.<ref>(Morris J.H 1984 : The Metallic Mineral Deposits of the Lower Palaeozoic Longford-Down Inlier in the Republic of Ireland Geological Survey of Ireland RS 84/1 Mineral Resources, pp72)</ref> The mine appears to have extended to a depth of 160&nbsp;m below surface, the site contained a combined engine and crusher house as well as mine offices, workshops and at least five shafts.<ref>(Morris J.H., Lally, P. and Cowman, D.

It has a rich history of local characters many of whom acquired their local knowledge and traditions from generations who have passed on. The area is located close to the Armagh border which provided an option for people to make a living during periods of economic recession also the Cashel and Tonagh bogs supplied a constant source of fuel to people for many years up to the late 1960s. Two lakes dominate the landscape in the townland, Lough Nahinch (The Island Lough) and Tassan Lough Natural Heritage Area both of which have been used by anglers for pike and perch fishing over the centuries.\n\n==History==\nTassan is located in the postal district of [[Clontibret]] where in 1595 in the adjacent countryside the [[Battle of Clontibret]] occurred. The territory of Monaghan had been wrested from the control of the MacMahon clan in 1591, when the clan leader was executed by English authority. Subsequent encroachments by the English into the province of [[Ulster]] led to the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595\u20131603). The battle was the earliest clash between the two sides, with the Irish led by [[Hugh \u00d3 Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] and the English by Sir Henry Bagenal. Although O'Neill won the battle, the war ended with the completion of the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English conquest of Ireland]]. In 1610 the [[Plantation of Ulster]] was established, an event that still defines certain political allegiances in the north of Ireland.\n\n===The Tassan Mining Company===\nThe Tassan Mining Company was established in the late 1840s and is recognised as one of the largest and most productive lead mines in County Monaghan. Total production was reported at 742 tonnes of ore, including 546 tonnes of lead and 37.478g of silver. The mineralization was hosted by two lodes each striking Northwest and dipping Eastwards.<ref>(Morris J.H 1984 : The Metallic Mineral Deposits of the Lower Palaeozoic Longford-Down Inlier in the Republic of Ireland Geological Survey of Ireland RS 84/1 Mineral Resources, pp72)</ref> The mine appears to have extended to a depth of 160&nbsp;m below surface, the site contained a combined engine and crusher house as well as mine offices, workshops and at least five shafts.<ref>(Morris J.H., Lally, P. and Cowman, D.

One year on and Foremsky had joined up with the Mount Royal College Cougars of the Alberta College's Athletic Hockey Conference (ACAC) posting 70 points in 28 games for the Cougars, leading the league in points, being picked for the first all-star team, receiving League MVP and setting a new league record for goals in a season.\n\n==Going pro==\nAt the end of the successful 2002-03 season Foremsky was given a short-term contract with the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]] of the [[ECHL]] grabbing 1+3 from 6 regular season games.

Foremsky also dominated the play-offs scoring 17 points in 7 games. His end of season plaudits included, top points scorer in EPL, top points scorer in League, Cup and Play-offs for Peterborough and selected for the EPL All-Star 1st Line 2006/07.

Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal%27s|Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis & Partners|John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the [[architecture]] is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the [[architect]] who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as [[New College Oxford]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal%27s|Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Buenos Aires|British Embassy in Buenos Aires]] \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College Oxford]], followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018[[Cool Britannia]]\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new [[British Embassy in Moscow]], designed by [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with love - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for [[St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford|St Hugh's College Oxford]]. The late 90s also saw the development of meeting and conference room tables for the executive boardroom market<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Corbett |first=Sue |date=22 October 1998 |title=Table d'Art | magazine=Country Life}}</ref>, culminating in two widely publicised corporate HQs for [[Unilever]] and [[Diageo]]<ref>{{cite news |date=February 2003 |title=The spirit of enlightenment \u2013 Diageo headquarters | work=Architecture Today | edition=AT 135 }}</ref>.\n\nSince 2000 the company has concentrated on commissions for public buildings, a large proportion of them of either historic or architectural interest or both.\n\n==Company Philosophy & Identity==\nThe \u2018core proposition\u2019 of the Luke Hughes brand is \u2018Furniture in Architecture\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lukehughes.co.uk/project/overview-furniture-in-architecture|title=Company website's 'Furniture in Architecture' projects page|website=lukehughes.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the [[architecture]] is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the [[architect]] who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as [[New College Oxford]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less [[CO2 emissions]]. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid [[hardwoods]] from suppliers who derive their raw material from [[forests]] managed to the standards of [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)]], [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification)]], [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative|SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative)]] or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.
