The player controls a member of a youth gang, the GGs, as they use [[inline skates]] to traverse Tokyo, spraying graffiti and evading authorities.\n\nDevelopment was headed by director Masayoshi Kikuchi, with art by Ryuta Ueda. Influence was drawn from late 90s Japanese pop culture such as the rhythm game ''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]'', and the anti-establishment themes in the film ''[[Fight Club]]''. The environments were based on Tokyo shopping districts in [[Shibuya]] and [[Shinjuku]], with graffiti designed by artists including [[Eric Haze]]. It was the first game to use a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] art style, developed in response to the team's disappointment towards Sega games mainly resembling anime or manga.\n\n''Jet Set Radio'' received acclaim for its graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. A [[Jet Grind Radio (Game Boy Advance)|Game Boy Advance version]], developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], was released in 2003, along with versions for Japanese mobile phones. In 2012, ''Jet Set Radio'' was digitally re-released for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[iOS]], followed by releases for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. A sequel, ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'',  was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2002.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Jet Set Radio gameplay.png|thumb|left|200px|The character Beat performing a grind on rails and tagging graffiti]]\n[[Player character|Player]] controls a member of a gang of [[graffiti]]-tagging [[Inline skating|inline skaters]]. The game consists of three types of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial.<ref name=\"manual\" /> The Street levels come in two categories.<ref name=\"manual\" /> The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /> The second category serves as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /> The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become.<ref name=\"Vice\">{{Cite web|title =What Today's Video Games Could Learn from \u2018Jet Set Radio\u2019 |url = https://www.vice.com/read/jet-set-radio-shows-us-15-years-later-that-video-games-have-an-influence-problem-553 |website = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=April 13, 2015 |accessdate = February 1, 2016}}</ref> Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /><ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a single button or inputting commands using the [[analog stick]] depending on the size of the graffiti spot.

There are three kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash.<ref name=\"manual\" /> In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the graffiti points within the [[Time limit (video games)|time limit]]. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor.<ref name=\"manual\" /> By using a [[VMU]], players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons scattered throughout stages.<ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Disc jockey|DJ]] Professor K, of the Jet Set Radio [[pirate radio]] station, broadcasts to gangs of youths who roam the streets of Tokyo-to, [[Inline skating|rollerblading]] and spraying [[graffiti]]. ''Jet Set Radio'' follows Beat and his gang, the GGs, who compete for turf with three main rival gangs: the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of [[Shibuya]]-Cho; the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district; and the [[kaiju]]-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with [[riot police]] and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious  [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. Professor K reveals over the radio that the mysterious vinyl that everyone is searching for has the power to summon a demon.\n\nThe GGs are joined by new skaters, Combo and Cube, who explain that two months prior, their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. Shortly after, the Rokkaku pursue the GGs and manage to steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains to the GGs that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon in order to take over Tokyo-to and the world by spinning the record over a turntable. The GGs confront and defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable and tagging his head with graffiti as he falls off the rooftop. Although Coin's fate remains uncertain, freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to. Combo reveals that ''The Devil's Contract'' was an old record with no demonic powers and that wealth had driven Goji to insanity.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.png|thumb|200px|''Jet Set Radio'' was originally developed with the Dreamcast specs in mind]]\n''Jet Set Radio'' was developed by [[Smilebit]], a [[Sega]] studio formed from members of [[Team Andromeda]], developers of the ''[[Panzer Dragoon]]'' games for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\":GS-History\">{{Cite web |title=GameSpot Presents: The History of Panzer Dragoon |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=June 1, 2005 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/panzerdragoon/4.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922195538/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/panzerdragoon/4.html|archivedate=September 22, 2004 |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> The development team consisted of fewer than 25 developers, with an average age of under 25.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/ |page=1 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130720044511/http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/ |title=Behind The Scenes: Jet Set Radio |date=January 7, 2011 |website=[[GamesTM]] |archivedate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Programming began in mid-1999.

His superiors were not satisfied with early concepts, and so Kikuchi used trial and error to develop a concept that he believed everyone would find interesting.<ref name=\"Rude Awakening\" />\n\nUeda wanted to create something \"cool\" that dealt with [[popular culture]] and was completely unlike the team's previous game, the 1998 role-playing game ''[[Panzer Dragoon Saga]]''.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\" />  Ueda's drawings of a [[Punk subculture|punky]] character with headphones and rollerblades became the foundation of the game.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Ueda had joined Sega after being impressed by the \"freshness\" and international appeal of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], but was disappointed with the number of manga and anime-style designs; he hoped to create something original.<ref name=\"ODCM-interview\">{{Cite magazine|date=August 2000|title=Radio Heads|url=https://archive.org/details/OfficialSegaDreamcast6JulAug2000/page/n33|magazine=[[Official Dreamcast Magazine (US magazine)|Official Dreamcast Magazine]]|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media Inc]]|issue=6|pages=33\u201335|accessdate=September 21, 2019}}</ref> Smilebit drew inspiration from games outside the typical game genres of science fiction and fantasy.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\" /> Ueda was particularly inspired by a demonstration of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] rhythm game ''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]'' at the 1996 [[Tokyo Game Show]]: \"I think that's the first game with pop culture like that.

It's not hard with modern hi-spec hardware, but that wasn't the case back then... It was very difficult from a programming standpoint.\"<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Another Sega game, ''[[Shenmue (video game)|Shenmue]]'' (1999), also featured an open world, but Kikuchi felt the games posed different technical challenges, as ''Shenmue'' does not allow the player to jump or move at speed.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> The team implemented [[Aggressive inline skating|grinding]] to allow players to enjoy speed without worrying about colliding with obstacles.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Smilebit chose to have a fixed camera as an attempt to avoid the Japanese audience getting motion-sickness.<ref name=\"Edge-mag-interview\" /> Smilebit was determined to making the game impossible to be duplicated on [[PlayStation 2]] by pushing the Dreamcast hardware and software limitations using bright colors, realistic shadows, and over sixteen displayable NPCs on-screen without [[lag]] that would have been impossible on PS2 due to its weaker memory.<ref name=\"Edge-mag-interview\" />\n\nThe settings were inspired by Japanese locations such as the Tokyo shopping district of [[Shibuya]] and [[Shinjuku]]. Smilebit traveled to those areas and took pictures as references during development.<ref name=\"GFan-interview\" /> Sega feared that the game's style might alienate players outside Japan and requested changes for the international versions.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\" /> The team added 2 stages modeled after New York City: An area based on [[Times Square]], and another inspired by [[Roosevelt Avenue]] along [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]].  Some story changes were also made, such as changing the nationality of two characters to American. The interactive credits sequence of the Japanese version was also cut, as localizing it would have meant rebuilding the stage with names written in English. Sega sold the international version in Japan as ''De La Jet Set Radio''.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\" /> Ueda was unhappy about the changes, which he felt diminished the essential Japanese elements of the game.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/3/ |page=3 |title=Behind The Scenes: Jet Set Radio |date=January 7, 2011 |website=[[GamesTM]] |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}{{dead link|date=September 2019 |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe ''Jet Set Radio'' soundtrack includes original and licensed tracks with a variety of genres including [[J-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]], [[rock music|rock]], [[acid jazz]], and [[trip hop]].<ref name=\"Rude Awakening\" /> The North American version and international rereleases adds [[Heavy metal music|metal]] songs.

The environments were based on Tokyo shopping districts in [[Shibuya]] and [[Shinjuku]], with graffiti designed by artists including [[Eric Haze]]. It was the first game to use a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] art style, developed in response to the team's disappointment towards Sega games mainly resembling anime or manga.\n\n''Jet Set Radio'' received acclaim for its graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. A [[Jet Grind Radio (Game Boy Advance)|Game Boy Advance version]], developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], was released in 2003, along with versions for Japanese mobile phones. In 2012, ''Jet Set Radio'' was digitally re-released for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[iOS]], followed by releases for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. A sequel, ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'',  was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2002.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Jet Set Radio gameplay.png|thumb|left|200px|The character Beat performing a grind on rails and tagging graffiti]]\n[[Player character|Player]] controls a member of a gang of [[graffiti]]-tagging [[Inline skating|inline skaters]]. The game consists of three types of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial.<ref name=\"manual\" /> The Street levels come in two categories.<ref name=\"manual\" /> The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /> The second category serves as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /> The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become.<ref name=\"Vice\">{{Cite web|title =What Today's Video Games Could Learn from \u2018Jet Set Radio\u2019 |url = https://www.vice.com/read/jet-set-radio-shows-us-15-years-later-that-video-games-have-an-influence-problem-553 |website = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=April 13, 2015 |accessdate = February 1, 2016}}</ref> Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them.<ref name=\"DC-UK\" /><ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a single button or inputting commands using the [[analog stick]] depending on the size of the graffiti spot.

There are three kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash.<ref name=\"manual\" /> In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the graffiti points within the [[Time limit (video games)|time limit]]. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor.<ref name=\"manual\" /> By using a [[VMU]], players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons scattered throughout stages.<ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Disc jockey|DJ]] Professor K, of the Jet Set Radio [[pirate radio]] station, broadcasts to gangs of youths who roam the streets of Tokyo-to, [[Inline skating|rollerblading]] and spraying [[graffiti]]. ''Jet Set Radio'' follows Beat and his gang, the GGs, who compete for turf with three main rival gangs: the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of [[Shibuya]]-Cho; the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district; and the [[kaiju]]-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with [[riot police]] and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious  [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. Professor K reveals over the radio that the mysterious vinyl that everyone is searching for has the power to summon a demon.\n\nThe GGs are joined by new skaters, Combo and Cube, who explain that two months prior, their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. Shortly after, the Rokkaku pursue the GGs and manage to steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains to the GGs that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon in order to take over Tokyo-to and the world by spinning the record over a turntable. The GGs confront and defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable and tagging his head with graffiti as he falls off the rooftop. Although Coin's fate remains uncertain, freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to. Combo reveals that ''The Devil's Contract'' was an old record with no demonic powers and that wealth had driven Goji to insanity.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.png|thumb|200px|''Jet Set Radio'' was originally developed with the Dreamcast specs in mind]]\n''Jet Set Radio'' was developed by [[Smilebit]], a [[Sega]] studio formed from members of [[Team Andromeda]], developers of the ''[[Panzer Dragoon]]'' games for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\":GS-History\">{{Cite web |title=GameSpot Presents: The History of Panzer Dragoon |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=June 1, 2005 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/panzerdragoon/4.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922195538/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/panzerdragoon/4.html|archivedate=September 22, 2004 |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> The development team consisted of fewer than 25 developers, with an average age of under 25.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/ |page=1 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130720044511/http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/ |title=Behind The Scenes: Jet Set Radio |date=January 7, 2011 |website=[[GamesTM]] |archivedate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Programming began in mid-1999.

His superiors were not satisfied with early concepts, and so Kikuchi used trial and error to develop a concept that he believed everyone would find interesting.<ref name=\"Rude Awakening\" />\n\nUeda wanted to create something \"cool\" that dealt with [[popular culture]] and was completely unlike the team's previous game, the 1998 role-playing game ''[[Panzer Dragoon Saga]]''.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\" />  Ueda's drawings of a [[Punk subculture|punky]] character with headphones and rollerblades became the foundation of the game.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Ueda had joined Sega after being impressed by the \"freshness\" and international appeal of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], but was disappointed with the number of manga and anime-style designs; he hoped to create something original.<ref name=\"ODCM-interview\">{{Cite magazine|date=August 2000|title=Radio Heads|url=https://archive.org/details/OfficialSegaDreamcast6JulAug2000/page/n33|magazine=[[Official Dreamcast Magazine (US magazine)|Official Dreamcast Magazine]]|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media Inc]]|issue=6|pages=33\u201335|accessdate=September 21, 2019}}</ref> Smilebit drew inspiration from games outside the typical game genres of science fiction and fantasy.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part1\" /> Ueda was particularly inspired by a demonstration of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] rhythm game ''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]'' at the 1996 [[Tokyo Game Show]]: \"I think that's the first game with pop culture like that.

It's not hard with modern hi-spec hardware, but that wasn't the case back then... It was very difficult from a programming standpoint.\"<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Another Sega game, ''[[Shenmue (video game)|Shenmue]]'' (1999), also featured an open world, but Kikuchi felt the games posed different technical challenges, as ''Shenmue'' does not allow the player to jump or move at speed.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> The team implemented [[Aggressive inline skating|grinding]] to allow players to enjoy speed without worrying about colliding with obstacles.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part2\" /> Smilebit chose to have a fixed camera as an attempt to avoid the Japanese audience getting motion-sickness.<ref name=\"Edge-mag-interview\" /> Smilebit was determined to making the game impossible to be duplicated on [[PlayStation 2]] by pushing the Dreamcast hardware and software limitations using bright colors, realistic shadows, and over sixteen displayable NPCs on-screen without [[lag]] that would have been impossible on PS2 due to its weaker memory.<ref name=\"Edge-mag-interview\" />\n\nThe settings were inspired by Japanese locations such as the Tokyo shopping district of [[Shibuya]] and [[Shinjuku]]. Smilebit traveled to those areas and took pictures as references during development.<ref name=\"GFan-interview\" /> Sega feared that the game's style might alienate players outside Japan and requested changes for the international versions.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\" /> The team added 2 stages modeled after New York City: An area based on [[Times Square]], and another inspired by [[Roosevelt Avenue]] along [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]].  Some story changes were also made, such as changing the nationality of two characters to American. The interactive credits sequence of the Japanese version was also cut, as localizing it would have meant rebuilding the stage with names written in English. Sega sold the international version in Japan as ''De La Jet Set Radio''.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\" /> Ueda was unhappy about the changes, which he felt diminished the essential Japanese elements of the game.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Part3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-jet-set-radio/3/ |page=3 |title=Behind The Scenes: Jet Set Radio |date=January 7, 2011 |website=[[GamesTM]] |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}{{dead link|date=September 2019 |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe ''Jet Set Radio'' soundtrack includes original and licensed tracks with a variety of genres including [[J-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]], [[rock music|rock]], [[acid jazz]], and [[trip hop]].<ref name=\"Rude Awakening\" /> The North American version and international rereleases adds [[Heavy metal music|metal]] songs.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later.

Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nHe captained Tauranga in a match against [[Rangitaiki]] which was won 12-5 with Iles involved prominently throughout the match\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby Match Won by Tauranga/Good Game Against Rangitaiki Team\n| page =5\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LIII, Issue 8935\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19250720.2.25\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nHe captained Tauranga in a match against [[Rangitaiki]] which was won 12-5 with Iles involved prominently throughout the match\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby Match Won by Tauranga/Good Game Against Rangitaiki Team\n| page =5\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LIII, Issue 8935\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19250720.2.25\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.
