This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history.\n\n[[Muhammad Ali]] is the only  boxer in the history of the heavyweight division to become Lineal world heavyweight champion three times: [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Michael Moorer]], [[Lennox Lewis]],  [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Ruslan Chagaev]] have held various versions of the title belts on three occasions.\n\nSix kickboxers have regained the Lineal heavyweight title: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, [[George Foreman]],  Lennox Lewis and [[Tyson Fury]].\n\nFour boxers have regained the heavyweight title in an immediate rematch: Floyd Patterson in 1960, Muhammad Ali in 1978, Lennox Lewis in 2001, and [[Anthony Joshua]] in 2019.\n\n[[Mike Tyson]] holds the record for being the youngest heavyweight to ever have achieve championship status. Becoming champion at age 20 years old.\n\nWith the exceptions of Lewis, Joshua, and Fury, each of the listed champions accomplished these feats back when the heavyweight minimum was set at 175 pounds, rather than 200. The cruiserweight division (first for boxers in the 175-190 pound range, later increased to the 175-200 pound range) was not established until 1979.\n\n====Historical development====\nBecause this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined. In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg stlb}} or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).\n\nThe first [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] was [[John L. Sullivan]], known as \"The Boston Strong Boy\". He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion.  He was defeated by [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.\n\nIn 1920, the light heavyweight division was formed, with a maximum weight of {{convert|175|lb|kg stlb}}. \nAny fighter weighing more than 175 pounds was a heavyweight. In the 1980s, the various boxing organizations recognized the cruiserweight division, with a maximum weight of either {{convert|190|lb|kg stlb}} or {{convert|195|lb|kg stlb}}. Later these organizations increased the cruiserweight limit to 200 pounds.\n\nSince 1975, the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] and the Soviet Sports Committee established a new concept in international boxing, called \"Heavy Duals,\" an all-heavyweight team contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>'Heavy' Date, ''AAU News'', 1975, v. 45, p. 10.</ref>\n\n====Champions====\n{{main|List of world heavyweight boxing champions}}\n'''Current champions'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sanctioning Body\n!Reign Began\n!Champion\n!Record\n!Defenses\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]\n|February 22, 2020\n|{{flagicon|UK}} [[Tyson Fury]]\n|30-0\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|}\n\n==== All-time table ====\n{{main|World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics}}\n\nThis list does not include ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' and [[lineal championship]] fights after 1921.\n\n===== Most wins in title fights =====\n\nKeys:\n:{{Color box|#B2FFFF|border=darkgray}} Active title reign\n:{{Color box||border=darkgray}} Reign has ended\n\n:'''Note 1:''' WBA (Regular) champions are not included\n:'''Note 2:''' WBO heavyweight title bouts before August 1997 are not included<ref name=\"wbotitlebouts\">James B.

The World Heavyweight Championship in wrestling is usually considered the main title in a given promotion. Prior to the wrestling industry publicly acknowledging the predetermined nature of the sport, a Heavyweight title was generally competed for by larger wrestlers while smaller wrestlers competed as (among other names and classifications) \"[[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|Junior Heavyweights]]\" and \"Light-Heavyweights\".\n\n==Analogous uses==\nThe word \"heavyweight\" is sometimes used in other fields (''e.g.'' politics) to denote a person who is especially powerful or influential. In this context, \"big beast\" has a similar meaning.

This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history.\n\n[[Muhammad Ali]] is the only  boxer in the history of the heavyweight division to become Lineal world heavyweight champion three times: [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Michael Moorer]], [[Lennox Lewis]],  [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Ruslan Chagaev]] have held various versions of the title belts on three occasions.\n\nSix boxers have regained the Lineal heavyweight title: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, [[George Foreman]],  Lennox Lewis and [[Tyson Fury]].\n\nFour boxers have regained the heavyweight title in an immediate rematch: Floyd Patterson in 1960, Muhammad Ali in 1978, Lennox Lewis in 2001, and [[Anthony Joshua]] in 2019.\n\n[[Mike Tyson]] holds the record for being the youngest heavyweight to ever have achieve championship status. Becoming champion at age 20 years old.\n\nWith the exceptions of Lewis, Joshua, and Fury, each of the listed champions accomplished these feats back when the heavyweight minimum was set at 175 pounds, rather than 200. The cruiserweight division (first for boxers in the 175-190 pound range, later increased to the 175-200 pound range) was not established until 1979.\n\n====Historical development====\nBecause this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined. In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg stlb}} or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).\n\nThe first [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] was [[John L. Sullivan]], known as \"The Boston Strong Boy\". He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion.  He was defeated by [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.\n\nIn 1920, the light heavyweight division was formed, with a maximum weight of {{convert|175|lb|kg stlb}}. \nAny fighter weighing more than 175 pounds was a heavyweight. In the 1980s, the various boxing organizations recognized the cruiserweight division, with a maximum weight of either {{convert|190|lb|kg stlb}} or {{convert|195|lb|kg stlb}}. Later these organizations increased the cruiserweight limit to 200 pounds.\n\nSince 1975, the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] and the Soviet Sports Committee established a new concept in international boxing, called \"Heavy Duals,\" an all-heavyweight team contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>'Heavy' Date, ''AAU News'', 1975, v. 45, p. 10.</ref>\n\n====Champions====\n{{main|List of world heavyweight boxing champions}}\n'''Current champions'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sanctioning Body\n!Reign Began\n!Champion\n!Record\n!Defenses\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]\n|February 22, 2020\n|{{flagicon|UK}} [[Tyson Fury]]\n|30-0\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|}\n\n==== All-time table ====\n{{main|World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics}}\n\nThis list does not include ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' and [[lineal championship]] fights after 1921.\n\n===== Most wins in title fights =====\n\nKeys:\n:{{Color box|#B2FFFF|border=darkgray}} Active title reign\n:{{Color box||border=darkgray}} Reign has ended\n\n:'''Note 1:''' WBA (Regular) champions are not included\n:'''Note 2:''' WBO heavyweight title bouts before August 1997 are not included<ref name=\"wbotitlebouts\">James B.

The World Heavyweight Championship in wrestling is usually considered the main title in a given promotion. Prior to the wrestling industry publicly acknowledging the predetermined nature of the sport, a Heavyweight title was generally competed for by larger wrestlers while smaller wrestlers competed as (among other names and classifications) \"[[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|Junior Heavyweights]]\" and \"Light-Heavyweights\".\n\n==Analogous uses==\nThe word \"heavyweight\" is sometimes used in other fields (''e.g.'' politics) to denote a person who is especially powerful or influential. In this context, \"big beast\" has a similar meaning.

Its neighbouring peaks are: to the west, separated by the ''Nurpensjoch'' saddle (2,525&nbsp;m), the ''Halslspitze'' at 2,574 metres, and beyond that over the  [[Wattentaler Lizum]], the ''[[Hirzer (Tux Alps)|Hirzer]]'' (2,725&nbsp;m). To the north lies the ''[[Ro\u00dfkopf (Tux Alps)|Ro\u00dfkopf]]'' (2,576&nbsp;m) and - jutting far out into the [[Inn valley]] - the ''[[Gilfert]]'' (2,506&nbsp;m) and, to the east, separated by the ''Hoarbergjoch'' (2,590&nbsp;m), the ''[[Pangert]]'' at 2,550 metres.\n\nDue to its [[topographical prominence|prominent]] location in the south of the Tuxertal, the Rastkogel is an oft-frequented mountain. At its summit the crest divides like a cross into the three aforementioned directions, although its rock faces are mainly oriented in a north-south direction. To the south the massif drops relatively steeply into the Tuxertal.\n\n== Bases and routes to the summit ==\n[[File:Rastkogel ski slope.jpg|thumb|left|Ski lifts on the Rastkogel.]]\nAn ascent of the Rastkogel as an Alpine mountain hike along the normal route, which is the easiest one, takes about 3 hours, approaching from the north along the southeast ridge (''S\u00fcdostgrat'') from the [[Rastkogel Hut]] (2,117&nbsp;m). Another route runs from the [[Weidener Hut]] (1,799 m) to the northwest over the Haslspitze and the west ridge (''Westgrat'') taking a good four hours to gain the summit.\n\nOn the southwest flank of the Rastkogels there is a [[skiing area]] that is reached from Vorderlanersbach on a [[ski lift]].\n\nA popular route for those staying in Mayrhofen is to take the Penken lift to the top station and then walk along route 23 to Penkenjoch with views across the Zillertal Alps. Route 57 should then be followed (clearly signposted) past the Wanglalm hut. Route 57 then climbs up to the summit of the Wanglspitze at 2420m continuing on to Hoarbergjoch at 2590m. Continue NNW along route 57 until it joins route 51.  Continue along route 51 which becomes steeper until the ridge is reached.  Turn west along a well marked trail that leads to the summit of Rastkogel.  The final km involves some mild scrambling.  The recommended time for the walk is 3.5 to 4 hours each way.  These timings are for an average walker in good conditions.  The Penken lift starts at 9.00 am and the last trip down is at 4.30pm (2011).  It is worth checking before starting as if there are no more lifts it is another 2 to 3 hours walking down to Mayrhofen.

There is a Memorial Stone of C.S. Goldman in the yard on the [[Murray United Church]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Cape Colony]], Goldman was a [[uitlander]] who spent much of his life in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. Charles Sydney Goldman was perhaps one of the Province's most enigmatic historic figures. A German of Jewish ancestry, he left Germany for England, where he married the granddaughter of [[Sir Robert Peel]]. His next move was to South Africa, where he made a fortune in ostrich farming and gold mining. As a young man he built up a fortune in mining, using some of the profits to purchase an extensive estate known as Schoongezicht in the Middelburg District. During the [[Second Boer War]], Goldman was a [[war correspondent]] for ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'' and was a major in the British forces, who assisted Winston Churchill as a war correspondent. Initially attached to Sir [[Redvers Buller]]'s relief force, he travelled with them as far as [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]] after which he transferred to the cavalry advancing north in order to report on their endeavours. These experiences served as the foundation for Goldman's subsequent book ''With General French and the Cavalry in South Africa''. He then moved to [[British Columbia]], where he founded Nicola Stock Farm (now Nicola Ranch) in Merritt. He wrote a lengthy account of the Boer War, edited and translated several other historic works, as well as being a collector of [[Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] art.  One of his legacies still enjoyed by the public is [[Monck Provincial Park]] on the shore of [[Nicola Lake]].\n\nAfter this war, in an effort to gain political influence Goldman purchased the struggling weekly journal, ''[[The Outlook (British magazine)|The Outlook]]''.<ref>[[Stephen Koss]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain'', vol. 1:''The Nineteenth Century'' (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1981), p. 434</ref> Seeking to develop it into a prominent platform for the cause of [[Imperial Preference|tariff reformers]], he hired the journalist [[James Louis Garvin|J. L. Garvin]] as its editor. Garvin quickly transformed the journal into a publication of note, yet in spite of an increase in both prominence and circulation the paper failed to turn a profit. After a series of disagreements between the two men over business matters, Goldman sold the paper to [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Lord Iveagh]] in October 1906.<ref>Alfred M. Gollin, ''The Observer and J. L. Garvin, 1908-1914: A Study in a Great Editorship'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 14-15</ref>\n\nStill desiring a political role, Goldman involved himself in politics directly by entering Parliament, winning the [[Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn and Falmouth]] seat in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] and serving until the borough was abolished in 1918 (the name was transferred to a new county division). During the [[First World War]], Goldman served as a major in the [[Cornwall]] [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]. In 1919 he purchased the Nicola Ranch and Town site in [[Nicola, British Columbia]] which grew to some {{convert|300000|acre|km2}}. He owned all the way up to [[Monck Provincial Park]]. Which is now that name. He named this park after his son Commander Victor Robert Penryn Monck of the [[Royal Navy]]. In England Goldman lived at Trefusis House, [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] until about 1929, after which he moved to the Jacobean mansion at [[Yaverland Manor]].\n\n==Family==\nGoldman married, in 1899, Honourable Agnes Mary Peel (1869-1959), daughter of [[Liberal Party (UK)|liberal]] politician [[Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel]]. She was decorated with the [[Royal Red Cross]], and was in December 1901 appointed a ''Lady of Grace'' of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Venerable Order of Saint John of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27383 |date=6 December 1901 |page=8639}}</ref> They had 3 children.\n\n==Works==\n* ''The financial, statistical, and general history of the gold & other companies of Witwatersrand, South Africa'' (1892)[https://books.google.com/books?id=rm0ZAAAAYAAJ&dq=charles+sydney+goldman+general+The+financial,+statistical,+and+general+history+of+the+gold+%26+other+companies+of+Witwatersrand,+South+Africa&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=QDZ2pB5PL0&sig=i0GxxQaVzKSM0pVHI5lS7hHUDl8&hl=en&ei=GivbSpvGAsSa8AbegtG3BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false]\n* ''With General French and the Cavalry in South Africa'' (1905)[https://books.google.com/books?id=_xZXAAAAMAAJ&dq=charles+sydney+goldman+general+french+cavalry&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=CWaum986kR&sig=ZBp_yRyrt2JoMkVjTd0QWNGhCx0&hl=en&ei=yCrbSqTXOYrM8QaSz8W3BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false]\n* (as editor) ''The Empire and the century: A series of essays on imperial problems and possibilities'' (1905)[https://books.google.com/books?id=-hELAAAAYAAJ&dq=charles+sydney+goldman+empire+century&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=OfVTgWT1-l&sig=eQfUf-jq8PuGAOM41yl461gSPtU&hl=en&ei=PCvbSr_5OcTh8AbixtS3BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false]\n* (as translator) ''Cavalry In Future Wars'' (1906)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Who was Who, 1951-1960'', p.&nbsp;430.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Goldman,+Charles+Sydney | name=Charles Sydney Goldman}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Charles Sydney Goldman |birth=1868 |death=1958 |sopt=t }}\n*{{Hansard-contribs | mr-charles-goldman | Charles Sydney Goldman }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn and Falmouth]]\n  | years  = [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] \u2013 [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n  | before = [[Sir John Barker, 1st Baronet|Sir John Barker]]\n  | after  = [[Edward Nicholl|Sir Edward Nicholl]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldman, Sydney}}\n[[Category:1868 births]]\n[[Category:1958 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Royal Garrison Artillery officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Cape Colony people]]\n[[Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:South African people of German-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Jewish British politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name        = Charles Sydney Goldman\n| image       = Charles Sydney Goldmann Vanity Fair 28 January 1904.jpg\n| image_size  = \n| caption     = \"a self-made African\" as caricatured by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]], January 1904\n| birth_name  =  \n| birth_date  = April 28, 1868\n| birth_place = Cape Colony\n| death_date  = April 7, 1958\n| death_place = British Columbia, Canada\n| death_cause = \n| resting_place = Yaverland, Isle of White\n| resting_place_coordinates = \n| residence   = \n| nationality = [[United Kingdom|British]]\n| other_names = C.S.

From 1991 to April of 1993 lyrics and vocals were provided by Louis DeWray. Niall Murphy then sang with the band until November 1994. Vlad departed quickly after Niall. Vlad sued Damien using a conventional solicitor. Damien hired Sony Music's lawyers and counter-sued. Vlad lost the lawsuit, retreating into obscurity. Dominic LaVey provided vocals from March 1995 to February 2002 then Louis DeWray returned as vocalist and songwriter in 2003, having performed in the meantime with Fashionable Living Death and his own band Ditzy Micro. DeWray played guitar, bass, keyboard and percussion in the band at various times until December 2014. DeWray, DeVille, Moonshie and Star contributed songwriting and instrumentation for the 2011 Wonderland album, which was developed over a seven-year period. Tim Vic replaced Louis DeWray as lead vocalist in 2014 and has gained massive recognition in Germany due to his exceptional vocal range which is akin to soprano.\n\nNosferatu have performed over 325 concerts in 14 countries since 1986 including Austria, Belgium, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Spain and Wales. The main prestigious events Nosferatu have performed at are LKA Longhorn, Stuttgart, Germany in January 2020, the 100 Club in London, England in 2019, Amphi Fest in Cologne, Germany in 2016, the Wave Gothic Treffen Festival in Leipzig, Germany in 2015, 2011, 2009, 2006, 1999 & 1994; the NCN Festival in Deutzen, Germany in 2012; the Mera Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany in 2007 & 2002; the Castle Party Festival in Poland in 2011; the DV8 Festival in York in 2011 & 2010, England; the Judgement Day Festival Dornbirn in 2006, Austria; the Existence Festival in Valencia, Spain in 2006; the Vampiricon Festival in Duisburg, Germany in 2003; Sacrosanct Festival London in 1995 and Reading in 2014; the Waregem Gothic Festival in Waregem, Belgium in 2010, the Lumous Festival in Tampere, Finland in 2011 and many more shows at other prestigious venues such as Le Gibus, Paris, France, Nottingham Rock City, the Fulham Greyhound, London, the Marquee, London.\n\nNosferatu are currently working on their sixth studio album \"Grail Hunting\" at 2 prestigious recording studios in Germany.

In 1991, they recorded ''The Hellhound'' EP with vocalist Louis DeWray replacing Aurora. In 1992, [[Dave Roberts (musician)|Dave Roberts]] of the gothic rock group [[Sex Gang Children]] wanted Nosferatu to release a compilation of their singles so far under the [[Cleopatra Records]] label, but the band agreed to record new songs towards their debut album ''[[Rise (Nosferatu album)|Rise]]'' in 1993. Afterwards, Niall Murphy replaced DeWray on vocals for their Halloween shows.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Nosferatu released a compilation of early recordings called ''Legend'' and their second studio album ''The Prophecy''. Afterwards, Murphy was replaced by Dominic LaVey, and Janicek left the band, with Dante Savarelle replacing. The group signed with Hades Records, and released ''[[Prince of Darkness (Nosferatu album)|Prince of Darkness]]'' in 1996. In 1998, the group released ''[[Lord of the Flies (Nosferatu album)|Lord of the Flies]]'' with bassist Doc Milton replacing Savarelle, and guest drummer [[Rat Scabies]] formerly of [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBassist Stefan Diablo replaced Milton and the band worked on the album ''Re Vamped'', released in 1999. ''Re Vamped'' had remixes and some new tracks. In 2000, they released the live album ''Reflections Through a Darker Glass''. They released another compilation album ''The Best of Nosferatu, Vol. 1''<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n\n<!-- NEED SOURCES  previous writeup\nJanicek played bass guitar/keys  until November 1994, and designed the first Nosferatu Logo and stage sets. Aurora provided vocals until April 1990, after which Gary Ash (Gary Clarke) sang briefly with the band until October of that year. In 1991 vocals were provided by Louis DeWray, who remained until April 1993. Chris Clark joined the band briefly in 1994 on drums. Niall Murphy then sang with the band until November 1994, and Dominic LaVey  provided vocals from March 1995 to February 2002. \n\nLouis DeWray returned as a vocalist in 2003, having performed in the meantime with Fashionable Living Death and his own band Ditzy Micro.  He also played guitar, bass, keyboard and percussion in the band at various times until December 2014.<ref>[http://www.terrorizer.com/dominion/dominionfeatures/the-principles-of-goth-orchestration-an-interview-with-nosferatu \"The Principles of Goth Orchestration \u2013 An Interview with Nosferatu\"].

They drew on Victorian gothic and vampiric imagery and championed the stylistic excesses that many of their contemporaries disdained.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSapphire Aurora provided vocals until April 1990, and Gary Clarke sang briefly with the band from April to October of 1990.

Deville formed a new band in 1995 and decided to continue using the Nosferatu name without authorisation. Although this was contested by Janicek at the time, legal action was halted as the cost of litigation far outweighed any potential future income.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDominic LaVey provided vocals from March 1995 to February 2002.
