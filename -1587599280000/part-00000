During this period, they started a YouTube channel together as a project to keep them in touch, where they created videos about their experiences and topics related to Japanese and American cultures. The initial name of the channel, MyHusbandisJapanese, was created by Jun as a reference to Japanese pop culture, inspired by the title of the manga series ''[[My Darling Is a Foreigner]]''. The breakthrough was the video \"What NOT to do in Japan\", in March 2012, which quickly amassed hundreds of thousands of views (at the moment of its launch they had about a dozen subscribers).<ref

It allowed for the need to enhance pilot control of the [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-27M]] (later renamed Su-35), which was a further development of the [[Su-27]]. The sole aircraft had originally been built as the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] before having its thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. In addition, it was modified with updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] in April&nbsp;1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its [[supermaneuverability|supermanoeuvrability]] at [[air show]]s, performing manoeuvres such as a [[Kulbit|360-degree somersault]]. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production; despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe,<ref>Gethin 1998, p. 32.</ref> T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft's systems to the design bureau's other fighter designs.\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nThe Sukhoi Design Bureau started research on [[thrust vectoring]] as early as 1983,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> At the insistence of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the [[Chaplygin Siberian Scientific Research Institute Of Aviation|Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute]] studied [[Wiktionary:axisymmetric|axisymmetrical]] vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. [[Lyulka]] (later [[UEC Saturn|Lyulka-Saturn]]) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;146\u2013147.</ref> By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using its flying test beds.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;55.</ref>\n<!--\nMeanwhile, Sukhoi was busy with the T10M (later renamed ''Su-35'' in 1993) program, which was a comprehensive upgrade of the Su-27.

Engineers therefore installed thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] in the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] and was being used as a radar test bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 151.</ref> Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles on the aircraft.<ref name=G07_p151/>{{#tag:ref|According to ''[[Flight International]]'', engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft in late 1994.<ref>Barrie 1994, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>|group=\"N\"}} Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight-cleared.

Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system.<ref name=N96_p52>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Together with the aircraft's overall high [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] and the engine's [[full authority digital engine control]] feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems added maneuverability at high angles of attack and low speeds.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;151, 154.</ref> The aircraft's [[fire-control system|weapons-control system]] had also been improved, as it included an [[Bars radar|N011M Bars]] (literally \"Panther\") [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref><ref name=Gordon_2007_p158>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;158.</ref> The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><!-- The Su-37 also features an upgraded [[electronic warfare support measures]] package.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|pp=64\u201366.}}</ref>-->\n\nConsiderable improvement had also been made to the cockpit layout.

It allowed for the need to enhance pilot control of the [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-27M]] (later renamed Su-35), which was a further development of the [[Su-27]]. The sole aircraft had originally been built as the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] before having its thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. In addition, it was modified with updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] in April&nbsp;1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its [[supermaneuverability|supermanoeuvrability]] at [[air show]]s, performing manoeuvres such as a [[Kulbit|360-degree somersault]]. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production; despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe,<ref>Gethin 1998, p. 32.</ref> T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft's systems to the design bureau's other fighter designs.\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nThe Sukhoi Design Bureau started research on [[thrust vectoring]] as early as 1983,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> At the insistence of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the [[Chaplygin Siberian Scientific Research Institute Of Aviation|Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute]] studied [[Wiktionary:axisymmetric|axisymmetrical]] vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. [[Lyulka]] (later [[UEC Saturn|Lyulka-Saturn]]) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;146\u2013147.</ref> By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using its flying test beds.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;55.</ref>\n<!--\nMeanwhile, Sukhoi was busy with the T10M (later renamed ''Su-35'' in 1993) program, which was a comprehensive upgrade of the Su-27. The T10M would incorporate aerodynamic modifications, improved avionics and [[armament]], and have a better [[Turbofan|propulsion system]], designed to give it [[Supermaneuverability|greatly enhanced agility]].<ref name=Eden>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=469.}}</ref> The first Su-27M prototype (T-10S-70) made its maiden flight on 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;1988.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 62\">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=62.}}</ref> Later Su-35 prototypes featured [[glass cockpit]]s and modified [[vertical stabilizer]]s.<ref name=Eden/>\n\n[[File:Su-37 Kulbit.png|thumb|The Su-37 could perform the 360\u00b0 \"[[Kulbit|Frolov Chakra]]\", demonstrating its [[supermaneuverability]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Siuru|first=William|title=Supermaneuverability|journal=Airpower Journal|publisher=Air University Press|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|year=1998|accessdate=22 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207060039/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|issn=0897-0823}}</ref>]]-->\n\nDuring test flights of the Su-27Ms, which began in 1988, engineers discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] due to the ineffectiveness of [[flight control surfaces]] at low speeds. Engineers therefore installed thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] in the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] and was being used as a radar test bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 151.</ref> Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles on the aircraft.<ref name=G07_p151/>{{#tag:ref|According to ''[[Flight International]]'', engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft in late 1994.<ref>Barrie 1994, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>|group=\"N\"}} Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight-cleared. The aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU.<ref name=G07_p151>Gordon 2007, p. 151.</ref> The aircraft was rolled out in May.<ref>''Aviation Week & Space Technology'' 1995, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch axis]], together or differentially.<ref>Novichkov 1996, pp.&nbsp;52, 55.</ref><!--The engine not only incorporates a new-generation 2D TVC nozzle but also is resistant to engine [[compressor stall|surge]] even during inverted and flat spins, giving better reliability and maneuverability even when the [[angle of attack]] is 180\u00b0.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=69.}}</ref>-->\n\nApart from the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system.<ref name=N96_p52>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Together with the aircraft's overall high [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] and the engine's [[full authority digital engine control]] feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems added maneuverability at high angles of attack and low speeds.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;151, 154.</ref> The aircraft's [[fire-control system|weapons-control system]] had also been improved, as it included an [[Bars radar|N011M Bars]] (literally \"Panther\") [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref><ref name=Gordon_2007_p158>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;158.</ref> The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><!-- The Su-37 also features an upgraded [[electronic warfare support measures]] package.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|pp=64\u201366.}}</ref>-->\n\nConsiderable improvement had also been made to the cockpit layout. In addition to the [[head-up display]], the Su-37 had four [[Thales Group|Sextant Avionique]] [[Multi-function display|multi-function]] colour [[liquid crystal display]]s arranged in a \"T\" configuration; they had better backlight protection than the Su-27M's monochrome [[cathode ray tube]] displays. The displays presented to the pilot information about navigation, systems status, and weapons selection. The pilot sat on an [[ejection seat]] that was reclined to 30&nbsp;degrees to improve [[g-force]] tolerance.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><ref name=Gordon_2007_p154>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;154.</ref> <!--The pilot steers with a [[side-stick]] and pressure-sensing throttles.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 65\">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=65.}}</ref> The two-grip flying control configuration was designed to prevent the pilot from losing contact with the controls when the aircraft is engaged in fast vectored-thrust maneuvers.

According to Simonov, such a feature would allow pilots to develop new combat manoeuvres and tactics, greatly enhancing its effectiveness in dogfights.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;50.</ref> Among the new manoeuvres was the Super Cobra, which was a variation of the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and was demonstrated during the aircraft's international debut at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in September 1996. Piloted by Frolov, the aircraft pitched up 180&nbsp;degrees and maintained the tail-first position momentarily, which would theoretically allow the aircraft to fire a missile at a combat opponent.<ref name=Gordon_2007_p158/> The Super Cobra evolved into the ''[[kulbit]]'' (somersault), in which the Su-37 performed a 360-degree loop with an extremely tight turning radius the length of the aircraft.<ref>Velovich September 1996, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> According to test pilot [[Anatoly Kvochur]], thrust vectoring would have given the aircraft a considerable advantage in close-in [[dogfight]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski |first=Piotr |title=Su-37 dogfights will be '10 times as effective'|journal=Jane's Defence Weekly|location=Horley, UK|date=10 July 1996|issn=0265-3818}}</ref> Nonetheless, critics have questioned the practical benefits of such manoeuvres; although they would allow an early [[Radar lock-on|missile lock-on]], it would come at the expense of a rapid loss of [[kinetic energy]], which would leave the aircraft vulnerable when pilots missed their first shot.<ref>''Flight International'' 1996, p&nbsp;3: \"If the pilot does not kill the opposition with his first shot, then his own aircraft's lack of energy will means {{sic}} he could present an attractive target.\"</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was demonstrated at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1997. Although it was only able to perform on the last day of the show, the organisers recognised the Su-37 as the standout performer at the event.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Petrov|first=Ivan|script-title=ru:\u0421\u0443-37 \u2014 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/179961|newspaper=Kommersant|language=Russian|date=25 June 1997|accessdate=10 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010155651/https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/179961|archivedate=10 October 2017}}</ref> The aircraft thereafter participated in the [[MAKS (air show)|MAKS air show]] in Moscow, the [[International Defence Exhibition]] in Dubai, and the [[FIDAE|FIDAE air show]] in [[Santiago]], Chile, as authorities sought to export the aircraft.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;160, 164.</ref> With the expiration of the engines' service lives, the aircraft later had the AL-37FUs replaced with standard production AL-31F engines that lacked movable nozzles. The loss of thrust vectoring was somewhat compensated for by an update to the fly-by-wire flight control system. The aircraft's foreign avionics were also replaced with indigenous designs. It resumed test flights in October 2000.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;58.</ref> \n\nThe flight-test programme was ended on 19 December 2002, when the aircraft's port [[Tailplane|horizontal tail]] broke off during a high-g manoeuvre, leading to its crash at [[Shatura]], near Moscow. The structural failure was caused by repeated exceeding of the aircraft's [[design load]] during six years of testing.<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;172.</ref> The pilot Yuri Vashuk ejected safely.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sukhoi demonstrator crashes during testing |work=[[Flightglobal]]|date=31 December 2002 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sukhoi-demonstrator-crashes-during-testing-159684/|accessdate=25 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109050929/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sukhoi-demonstrator-crashes-during-testing-159684/|archivedate=9 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/956023|script-title=ru:\u0412 \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0421\u0443-35|newspaper=Kommersant|language=Russian|date=19 December 2002|accessdate=16 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105112216/http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/956023|archivedate=5 January 2016}}</ref><!--In 2001, 711 was outfitted with AL-37FU engines and updated fly-by-wire flight control system and avionics.--> Despite the entry of the Su-37 into Brazilian and [[F-X fighter program|South Korean fighter tenders]], the aircraft failed to gain any foreign customers. India in the mid-1990s funded the development of what would result in the [[Su-30MKI]], which is a two-seat fighter design that incorporated the canards, N011M radar and thrust-vectoring technology that were present and evaluated on the Su-37.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;47.</ref> In addition, through tests of the Su-27M and the Su-37, engineers had determined that thrust vectoring could compensate for the loss of manoeuvrability brought about by the removal of canards, the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe.<ref>Barrie 2003, p.&nbsp;39: \"While the canard layout brought advantages in terms of improved maneuverability, it also added structural weight to the airframe. A conventional airframe coupled with thrust vector control, the source said, could now provide the same capability.\"</ref> The modernized Su-35, without canards,<ref>Butowski 2004, p. 39: \"The problem was solved in a similar way: removal of the canards from the airframe structure. The aircraft maneuverability will not be affected since modern control systems are much more effective than those used previously. The Su-35BM {{sic}} will be equipped with the control system similar to the quadruple digital fly-by-wire SDU-427 system from the Su-47 Berkut experimental fighter.
