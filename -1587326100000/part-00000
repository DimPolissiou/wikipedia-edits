In Mexico, Islas has worked for [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] (AAA) and made appearances for various independent promotions but is not currently associated with one specific Mexican promotion. As Super Crazy, Islas gained American exposure by working for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) between 1998 and 2000 and for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] between 2005 and 2008. He has also toured Japan on several occasions, working for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling Zero-One]] (Zero-1), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career (1988\u20131997)===\nFrancisco Islas made his professional wrestling debut in February 1988, at just 14 years of age, after being trained by his older brother Rey Pantera. Islas took the [[ring name]] \"Super Crazy\". He initially worked as an ''[[wrestling mask|enmascarado]]'', or masked wrestler, but lost the mask just over a month after his debut when he lost a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]]'' (a \"bet match\") to [[Skayde|El Seminarista]] in March 1988.<ref name=\"TomoSuperCrazy\"/> From 1988 until 1995 Super Crazy was a mainstay on the Mexican [[independent circuit]] working for various promotions, including appearances for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) in the year leading up to its closure. In the UWA Super Crazy won the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]] on November 17, 1995 and held the title when the UWA closed in December 1995.<ref name=UWAWelter/> After the UWA closed Super Crazy still used and defended the UWA title on various independent shows but once he signed with the [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] promotion in 1996 the title was not mentioned. In AAA he was given a new gimmick, a masked ''Rudo'' (villain or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]) character called \"Histeria\" (sometimes [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as \"Hysteria\"). Together with [[Abismo Negro]], [[Maniaco]], [[X-Fly|Mosco de la Merced]] I and Mach-1 he comprised a wrestling group called ''Rudos de la Galaxia'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"The bad guys of the universe\"), a group that was involved in a [[Narrative thread|storyline]] feud with a ''tecnico'' (good guy or [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]) group called ''Los Cadetos del Espacio'' (Spanish for \"the Space Cadets\"). In the spring of 1997 Islas, as Histeria, made a couple of appearances for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) due to an AAA/WWF working agreement. Histeria worked mainly against ''Los Cadetos del Espacio'', especially [[Venum Black|Venum]] in his appearances on ''[[WWE Raw|RAW is WAR]]'' and ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun]]''. In September 1997 Islas left AAA, giving the \"Histeria\" name and outfit to another AAA wrestler who had worked as \"Quarterback\" up until that time, he still wrestles as [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]] today.<ref name=\"EncyHisteria\">{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Histeria (II) | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo II | page = 49 | date = August 2007 | language = Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIslas resumed working as \"Super Crazy\" when he left AAA to join the newly created [[Promo Azteca]].

December 3, 1973) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], or ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]]'', best known by his [[ring name]] '''Super Crazy'''. In Mexico, Islas has worked for [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] (AAA) and made appearances for various independent promotions but is not currently associated with one specific Mexican promotion. As Super Crazy, Islas gained American exposure by working for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) between 1998 and 2000 and for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] between 2005 and 2008. He has also toured Japan on several occasions, working for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling Zero-One]] (Zero-1), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career (1988\u20131997)===\nFrancisco Islas made his professional wrestling debut in February 1988, at just 14 years of age, after being trained by his older brother Rey Pantera. Islas took the [[ring name]] \"Super Crazy\". He initially worked as an ''[[wrestling mask|enmascarado]]'', or masked wrestler, but lost the mask just over a month after his debut when he lost a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]]'' (a \"bet match\") to [[Skayde|El Seminarista]] in March 1988.<ref name=\"TomoSuperCrazy\"/> From 1988 until 1995 Super Crazy was a mainstay on the Mexican [[independent circuit]] working for various promotions, including appearances for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) in the year leading up to its closure. In the UWA Super Crazy won the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]] on November 17, 1995 and held the title when the UWA closed in December 1995.<ref name=UWAWelter/> After the UWA closed Super Crazy still used and defended the UWA title on various independent shows but once he signed with the [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] promotion in 1996 the title was not mentioned. In AAA he was given a new gimmick, a masked ''Rudo'' (villain or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]) character called \"Histeria\" (sometimes [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as \"Hysteria\"). Together with [[Abismo Negro]], [[Maniaco]], [[X-Fly|Mosco de la Merced]] I and Mach-1 he comprised a wrestling group called ''Rudos de la Galaxia'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"The bad guys of the universe\"), a group that was involved in a [[Narrative thread|storyline]] feud with a ''tecnico'' (good guy or [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]) group called ''Los Cadetos del Espacio'' (Spanish for \"the Space Cadets\"). In the spring of 1997 Islas, as Histeria, made a couple of appearances for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) due to an AAA/WWF working agreement. Histeria worked mainly against ''Los Cadetos del Espacio'', especially [[Venum Black|Venum]] in his appearances on ''[[WWE Raw|RAW is WAR]]'' and ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun]]''.

(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London. On 1 August 1946, Stevenage was designated the first New Town under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-37826783|title=The town that aimed for Utopia|first=Jodie|last=Halford|date=11 November 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe plan was not popular and local people protested at a meeting held in the town hall before [[Lewis Silkin]], minister in the Labour Government of Clement Attlee. As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area. For many years [[British Aerospace]] (now [[MBDA]]) was the largest employer in the town but now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] has a large pharmaceutical research laboratory complex (which is known as 'The Palace' to many of its inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|title=Peter's weather website|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234840/http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> A smaller but interesting enterprise is [[Astrium]], which for some decades (as part of British Aerospace and its predecessors) has manufactured spacecraft, both as prime contractor and as equipment supplier.\n\nThere are many small- to medium-size firms as well.

(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London.

As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area. For many years [[British Aerospace]] (now [[MBDA]]) was the largest employer in the town but now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] has a large pharmaceutical research laboratory complex (which is known as 'The Palace' to many of its inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|title=Peter's weather website|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234840/http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> A smaller but interesting enterprise is [[Astrium]], which for some decades (as part of British Aerospace and its predecessors) has manufactured spacecraft, both as prime contractor and as equipment supplier.\n\nThere are many small- to medium-size firms as well.

Indeed, the [[Woodland Trust]] ranks it as one of the best places in the UK for ease of access to large woodland, with 99.9% of the population having access to woodland over {{convert|2|ha|acre|0}} within {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, only slightly behind those living in the [[Forest of Dean]] or [[New Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/mediafile/100083906/space-for-people.pdf|title=2638 Space for People|year=2010|accessdate=3 January 2014|work=[[Woodland Trust]]}}</ref> There are also many playing fields (e.g. St. Nicholas playing fields near Ripon Road). The town's schools all have a substantial amount of ground; key examples are Ashtree Primary School, Moss Bury Primary School, Longmeadow Primary School and Barnwell.\n\nStevenage also has a basketball team: Stevenage Scorpions.\n\nThe town is surrounded by the Stevenage Outer Orbital Path (STOOP), a {{convert|27|mi|km|adj=on}} circuit walk established by the North Herts Ramblers Group in 2008. The circuit provides an informal, active recreational leisure amenity readily available to the residents of Stevenage and the surrounding villages. The STOOP is split into several sections, accessible via a series of links from the town. The route passes through [[Graveley, Hertfordshire|Graveley]], [[Walkern]], [[River Beane|Beane Valley]], [[Datchworth]], [[Woolmer Green]], [[Knebworth Park]], [[St Ippolyts]] and [[Little Wymondley]]. It was launched on 20 September 2008.<ref name=\"ramblers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ramblers-herts-northmiddlesex.org.uk/stoop.htm|title=STOOP (Stevenage Outer Orbital Path)|publisher=Hertfordshire & North Middlesex Area of the Ramblers' Association|accessdate=25 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143050/http://ramblers-herts-northmiddlesex.org.uk/stoop.htm|archivedate=22 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"SBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/townandcommunity/soneighbourly/stooprightonit|title=STOOP right on it|publisher=[[Stevenage Borough Council]]|accessdate=25 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718111408/http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/townandcommunity/soneighbourly/stooprightonit|archivedate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA small community arts centre is located in the Roaring Meg Retail Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/31028/31013/|title=Arts in Stevenage}}</ref> The Boxfield and Foyer Gallery is situated in the [[Gordon Craig Theatre]], which forms part of the large central Leisure Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon-craig.co.uk/EducationsVisualArts/VisualArts.aspx|title=Gordon Craig Theatre|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220506/http://www.gordon-craig.co.uk/EducationsVisualArts/VisualArts.aspx|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> Stevenage Museum is located under the St. Andrew and St. George's church on St George's Way<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/about-stevenage/museum/|title=Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Nearby attractions==\nNorth of Stevenage Old Town, near St Nicholas' Church, lies Rooks' Nest (\"under the big [[wych elm|wych-elm]]\"), home of the novelist [[Edward Morgan Forster]] from 1884 to 1894. Forster used Rooksnest and the surrounding area as the setting for his novel ''[[Howards End]]''. In the preface to one paperback edition of ''Howards End'' there is a lot to be found about landmarks of Stevenage and their relationship to the story of the novel, such as Stevenage High Street and the [[Six Hills]]. The land north of St Nicholas' Church, known as Forster Country, is the last remaining farmland within the boundary of Stevenage borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forstercountry.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=27|title=Where is Forster Country?|publisher=Friends of the Forster Country|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=23 August 2009}}</ref> Forster was unhappy with the development of new Stevenage, which would, in his words, \"fall out of the blue sky like a meteorite upon the ancient and delicate scenery of Hertfordshire\".<ref name=Austerity/>\n\nAlso close to Stevenage is [[Knebworth House]], a [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic]] stately home and venue of globally renowned rock concerts since 1974. The house was once home to [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], Victorian English novelist and spiritualist.\n\n==Transport==\nA distinctive feature of Stevenage is its urban landscape.  It has many [[roundabout]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenheartpartnership.org/site/68/253.html|title=Stevenage \"sunken\" roundabout|author=Green Heart Partnership|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413022700/http://www.greenheartpartnership.org/site/68/253.html|archivedate=13 April 2011}}</ref> few [[traffic light]]s, a network of completely segregated [[Segregated cycle facilities|cycleways]], and some of the tallest [[street light]]s in Britain. [[Eric Claxton]] was chief engineer of Stevenage from 1962 to 1972, and the comprehensive separate cycle network was planned and implemented by him during that period. Despite this network, the bike mode share is 2.7%.<ref>{{cite news|title=Build it and they will come?

He was so adamant about roundabouts that he had a house built for himself on the gyratory system in the Old Town.\n\nStevenage is served by the [[A1(M) motorway]]. The old [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] passes through the centre of the town, and the High Street in the Old Town has several pubs that were [[coaching inn]]s on this road; it is mostly now classified as the [[B197 road|B197]]. Stevenage is also served by the [[A602 road|A602]], connecting the town to [[Hitchin]], [[Watton-at-Stone]], Hertford and [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]].\n\nBuses within and to outside the town are provided by several operators, the main within the town being [[Arriva Shires & Essex#Hitchin/Stevenage|Arriva The Shires]]. Other operators include [[Centrebus]], [[Uno (bus company)|Uno]], Cozy Travel and Trusty Bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|title=About us|date=21 January 2016|website=TrustyBus|access-date=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115132524/http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=15 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town is served by [[Stevenage railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and has regular commuter services to London and Cambridge, as well as connections to the North and Scotland.\n\n==Education==\nMany schools were built in the 1950s/60s due to an influx of Londoners to affordable terraced housing in areas such as Shephall, Broadwater, Chells and St Nicholas. The town has around 23 primary schools (see below). Some go to the surrounding villages of [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]], [[Benington, Hertfordshire|Benington]], [[Walkern]], [[Datchworth]] for their schooling. Stevenage also has a number of secondary schools and the central campus for North Hertfordshire College.\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Almond Hill Junior<ref>{{cite

After holding the chief offices in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Aegyptus Province|Aegyptus]] (Egypt), he went to [[Rome]] c. 120, where he practised as an [[advocate]], pleading cases before the emperors (probably as ''advocatus fisci'').<ref name=Loeb>{{cite book|last=White|first=Horace|title=Appian's Roman History|year=1912|publisher=The Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-99002-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/appianromanhisto00appi_466/page/ vii\u2013xii]|chapter=Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/appianromanhisto00appi_466/page/}}</ref> It was in 147 at the earliest that he was appointed to the office of [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]], probably in Egypt, on the recommendation of his friend [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]], a well-known [[litterateur]]. Because the position of procurator was open only to members of the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] (the \"knightly\" class), his possession of this office tells us about Appian's family background.\n\nHis principal surviving work (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ac ''Romaik\u00e1'', known in [[Latin]] as ''Historia Romana'' and in [[English language|English]] as ''Roman History'') was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in 24 books, before 165. This work more closely resembles a [[Monographic series|series of monographs]] than a connected history. It gives an account of various peoples and countries from the earliest times down to their incorporation into the [[Roman Empire]], and survives in complete books and considerable fragments.<ref name=Loeb/> The work is very valuable, especially for the period of the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appian|volume=2|pages=221\u2013222}}</ref>\n\n''The Civil Wars'', books 13\u201317 of the ''Roman History'', concern mainly the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and take a conflict-based view and approach to history. Despite the lack of cited sources for his works, these books of the ''Roman History'' are the only extant comprehensive description of these momentous decades of Roman history. The other extant work of Appian is his;\u201dThe Foreign Wars\u201d, which includes a ethnographic style history recounting the various military conflicts against a foreign enemy in Roman history, until the time of Appian.\n\n== Life ==\nLittle is known of the life of Appian of Alexandria. He wrote an autobiography that has been almost completely lost.<ref>Appian Proem. 62</ref> Information about Appian is distilled from his own writings and a letter{{which|date=March 2012}} by his friend [[Cornelius Fronto]].<ref>Michael Petrus Josephus Van Den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'', Volume 190 of ''Mnemosyne'' (Brill, 1999)</ref> However, it is certain that Appian was born around the year AD 95 in Alexandria, the capital of Roman Egypt. Since his parents were [[Roman citizen]]s capable of paying for their son's education, it can be inferred that Appian belonged to the wealthy upper classes.\n\nIt is believed that Appian moved to Rome in 120, where he became a barrister. In the introduction to his ''Roman History,'' he boasts \"that he pleaded cases in Rome before the emperors.\" The emperors he claims to have addressed must have been either Hadrian or [[Marcus Aurelius]] and definitely Antoninus Pius, for Appian remained in Egypt at least until the end of the reign of Trajan (117). In the letter of Cornelius Fronto, it is revealed that a request on behalf of Appian to receive the rank of procurator occurred during the [[co-regency]] of Marcus Aurelius and his brother [[Lucius Verus]] between 147 and 161. Although Appian won this office, it is unclear whether it was a real job or an honorific title. The only other certain biographical datum is that Appian's ''Roman History'' appeared sometime before 162. This is one of the few primary historical sources for the period.\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Radolt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Appian: ''Historia Romana''. Printed in Venice 1477 by [[Erhard Ratdolt]]]]\n\n===Appian's ''Roman History'' and ''The Civil Wars''===\n\nAppian began writing his history around the middle of the second century AD. \nOnly sections from half of the original 24 books survive today of a much larger history known as ''The Roman History''. The section of this history known as ''The Civil Wars'' is composed of books 13\u201317 of the original 24 of the ''Roman History''. This history narrates the history of the Romans from the time of the [[Gracchi|Gracchan tribunates]]. Going on to narrate the civil wars of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]] and those of [[Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. The history breaks off in the time of the [[Second Triumvirate]]. These five books stand out because they are one of the few comprehensive histories available on the transition of the Roman state from Republic to Empire and the ensuing civil and military strife. \n\nBesides Appian, this period is also covered by a handful of ancient authors with varying degrees of detail and viewpoints. The commentaries of Julius Caesar record his personal, mainly military, observations of the [[Gallic Wars]] and subsequent civil wars. [[Plutarch]]'s Roman biographies sketch the lives of the major leaders of the late Republican period. These biographies record events Plutarch thought interesting and give only a perfunctory explanation of historic events. The Roman author [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius]]' history examines Roman history from the city\u2019s foundation until AD 29. This history becomes more detailed in the late Republic / early Empire period, while earlier history is condensed. The ''Epitome of Roman History'' by [[Florus]], also covers Roman history from mythical times until the 5th century AD in an extremely condensed format. The history of [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] of Sicily also covers Roman history until the Gallic Wars, but this history becomes fragmentary after around 300 BC.\n\n===''The Foreign Wars''===\n\nAnother work of Appians history which still survives mostly extant, is called ''The Foreign Wars''. This history describes the wars Rome fought against other cultures throughout their history. The  mostly extant work narrates the wars in Spain, the [[Punic Wars]] in both Italy and Africa, the wars against the [[Seleucid Empire]], and the [[Mithridatic Wars]]. Several small fragments also survive, describing of the wars against the [[Samnites]], [[Illyrians]], Macedonians, [[Numidians]], and the Gauls. Especially notable is this work's [[ethnographic]] structure. Appian most likely used this structure to facilitate his readers' orientation through the sequence of events, which are united only by their relationship to Rome. For example, the chapter on Spain, recounts Roman history in Spain chronologically with the Romans' first intervention in Spain during the War with [[Hannibal]]. The book goes on to describe the Roman conquest of several regions of Spain, followed by their wars with  Spanish tribes and  the [[Numantine War]]. The chapter on Spain concludes with the war against [[Sertorius]] in roughly 61 BC. Likewise the chapter on the Hannibalic wars, only recounts the battles that took place on the Italian Peninsula during the second Punic war, while the Punic War chapters recount all the action that occurred in northern Africa during the first and second Punic war.\n\n===Sources===\n\nOne might expect that a historical work covering nine centuries and countless different peoples would involve a multitude of testimonials{{clarify|date=March 2012}} from different periods. However, Appian's sources remain uncertain, as he only mentions the source of his information under special circumstances. He may have relied primarily on one author for each book, whom he did not follow uncritically, since Appian also used additional sources for precision and correction.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} At our present state of knowledge questions regarding Appian\u2019s sources cannot be resolved.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Editions ==\n*{{Cite book\n| publisher = World Digital Library\n| title = Appiani Alexandrini Historia Publio Candido interprete Ac praeterea Anonymi Compendium historiae ab excessu Constantini usque ad Ioannem XXIII\n| accessdate = 2014-02-28\n| language = Latin\n| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11613/\n}}\n* ''[[Editio princeps]]'', 1551\n* [[Johann Schweigh\u00e4user|Schweigh\u00e4user]], 1785\n* [[August Immanuel Bekker|Bekker]], 1852\n* Ludwig Mendelssohn, 1878\u20131905, ''Appiani Historia Romana'', [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana]]\n* Paul Goukowsky, 1997\u2013, ''Appien.

After holding the chief offices in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Aegyptus Province|Aegyptus]] (Egypt), he went to [[Rome]] c. 120, where he practised as an [[advocate]], pleading cases before the emperors (probably as ''advocatus fisci'').<ref name=Loeb>{{cite book|last=White|first=Horace|title=Appian's Roman History|year=1912|publisher=The Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-99002-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/appianromanhisto00appi_466/page/ vii\u2013xii]|chapter=Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/appianromanhisto00appi_466/page/}}</ref> It was in 147 at the earliest that he was appointed to the office of [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]], probably in Egypt, on the recommendation of his friend [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]], a well-known [[litterateur]]. Because the position of procurator was open only to members of the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] (the \"knightly\" class), his possession of this office tells us about Appian's family background.\n\nHis principal surviving work (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ac ''Romaik\u00e1'', known in [[Latin]] as ''Historia Romana'' and in [[English language|English]] as ''Roman History'') was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in 24 books, before 165. This work more closely resembles a [[Monographic series|series of monographs]] than a connected history. It gives an account of various peoples and countries from the earliest times down to their incorporation into the [[Roman Empire]], and survives in complete books and considerable fragments.<ref name=Loeb/> The work is very valuable, especially for the period of the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appian|volume=2|pages=221\u2013222}}</ref>\n\n''The Civil Wars'', books 13\u201317 of the ''Roman History'', concern mainly the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and take a conflict-based view and approach to history. Despite the lack of cited sources for his works, these books of the ''Roman History'' are the only extant comprehensive description of these momentous decades of Roman history. The other extant work of Appian is his;\u201dThe Foreign Wars\u201d, which includes a ethnographic style history recounting the various military conflicts against a foreign enemy in Roman history, until the time of Appian.\n\n== Life ==\nLittle is known of the life of Appian of Alexandria. He wrote an autobiography that has been almost completely lost.<ref>Appian Proem. 62</ref> Information about Appian is distilled from his own writings and a letter{{which|date=March 2012}} by his friend [[Cornelius Fronto]].<ref>Michael Petrus Josephus Van Den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'', Volume 190 of ''Mnemosyne'' (Brill, 1999)</ref> However, it is certain that Appian was born around the year AD 95 in Alexandria, the capital of Roman Egypt. Since his parents were [[Roman citizen]]s capable of paying for their son's education, it can be inferred that Appian belonged to the wealthy upper classes.\n\nIt is believed that Appian moved to Rome in 120, where he became a barrister. In the introduction to his ''Roman History,'' he boasts \"that he pleaded cases in Rome before the emperors.\" The emperors he claims to have addressed must have been either Hadrian or [[Marcus Aurelius]] and definitely Antoninus Pius, for Appian remained in Egypt at least until the end of the reign of Trajan (117). In the letter of Cornelius Fronto, it is revealed that a request on behalf of Appian to receive the rank of procurator occurred during the [[co-regency]] of Marcus Aurelius and his brother [[Lucius Verus]] between 147 and 161. Although Appian won this office, it is unclear whether it was a real job or an honorific title. The only other certain biographical datum is that Appian's ''Roman History'' appeared sometime before 162. This is one of the few primary historical sources for the period.\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Radolt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Appian: ''Historia Romana''. Printed in Venice 1477 by [[Erhard Ratdolt]]]]\n\n===Appian's ''Roman History'' and ''The Civil Wars''===\n\nAppian began writing his history around the middle of the second century AD. \nOnly sections from half of the original 24 books survive today of a much larger history known as ''The Roman History''. The section of this history known as ''The Civil Wars'' is composed of books 13\u201317 of the original 24 of the ''Roman History''. This history narrates the history of the Romans from the time of the Gracchan tribunates. Going on to narrate the civil wars of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]] and those of [[Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. The history breaks off in the time of the second Triumvarate. These five books stand out because they are one of the few comprehensive histories available on the transition of the Roman state from Republic to Empire and the ensuing civil and military strife. Besides Appian, this period is also covered by a handful of ancient authors with varying degrees of detail and viewpoints. The commentaries of Julius Caesar record his personal mainly military observations of the [[Gallic Wars]] and subsequent civil wars. [[Plutarch]]'s Roman biographies sketch the lives of the major leaders of the late Republican period. These biographies record events Plutarch thought interesting and give only a perfunctory explanation of historic events. The Roman author [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius]]' history examines roman history from the city\u2019s foundation until AD 29. This history becomes more detailed in the late Republic / early Empire period, whilst earlier history is condensed. The ''Epitome of Roman History'' by [[Florus]], also covers Roman history from mythical times until the 5th century AD in an extremely condensed format. The history of [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] of Sicily also covers Roman history until the Gallic Wars, but this history becomes fragmentary after around 300 BC. \n\n===''The Foreign Wars''===\n\nAnother work of Appians history which still survives mostly extant, is called ''The Foreign Wars''. This history describes the wars Rome fought against other cultures throughout their history. The  mostly extant work narrates the wars in Spain, the [[Punic Wars]] in both Italy and Africa, the wars against the [[Seleucid Empire]], and the [[Mithridatic Wars]]. Several small fragments also survive, describing of the wars against the [[Samnites]], [[Illyrians]], Macedonians, [[Numidians]], and the Gauls. Especially notable is this work's [[ethnographic]] structure. Appian most likely used this structure to facilitate his readers' orientation through the sequence of events, which are united only by their relationship to Rome. For example, the chapter on Spain, recounts Roman history in Spain chronologically with the Romans' first intervention in Spain during the War with [[Hannibal]]. The book goes on to describe the Roman conquest of several regions of Spain, followed by their wars with  Spanish tribes and  the [[Numantine War]]. The chapter on Spain concludes with the war against [[Sertorius]] in roughly 61 BC. Likewise the chapter on the Hannibalic wars, only recounts the battles that took place on the Italian Peninsula during the second Punic war, while the Punic War chapters recount all the action that occurred in northern Africa during the first and second Punic war.\n\n===Sources===\n\nOne might expect that a historical work covering nine centuries and countless different peoples would involve a multitude of testimonials{{clarify|date=March 2012}} from different periods. However, Appian's sources remain uncertain, as he only mentions the source of his information under special circumstances. He may have relied primarily on one author for each book, whom he did not follow uncritically, since Appian also used additional sources for precision and correction.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} At our present state of knowledge questions regarding Appian\u2019s sources cannot be resolved.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Editions ==\n*{{Cite book\n| publisher = World Digital Library\n| title = Appiani Alexandrini Historia Publio Candido interprete Ac praeterea Anonymi Compendium historiae ab excessu Constantini usque ad Ioannem XXIII\n| accessdate = 2014-02-28\n| language = Latin\n| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11613/\n}}\n* ''[[Editio princeps]]'', 1551\n* [[Johann Schweigh\u00e4user|Schweigh\u00e4user]], 1785\n* [[August Immanuel Bekker|Bekker]], 1852\n* Ludwig Mendelssohn, 1878\u20131905, ''Appiani Historia Romana'', [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana]]\n* Paul Goukowsky, 1997\u2013, ''Appien.
