During the expedition, two members of the crew reached a new [[Farthest North]] record, but of the original 25&nbsp;men, only seven survived to return.\n\nThe expedition was under the auspices of the Signal Corps at a time when the Corps' Chief Disbursements officer, [[Henry W. Howgate]], was arrested for [[embezzlement]]. However, that did not deter the planning and execution of the voyage.\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== First year, 1881 ===\n[[File:Lady Franklin Bay expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Proteus'' at [[Qeqertarsuaq]] harbor]]\nThe expedition was led by Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]] of the Fifth United States Cavalry, with astronomer [[Edward Israel]] and photographer [[George W. Rice (photographer)|George W. Rice]] among the crew of 21&nbsp;officers and men. They sailed on the ship ''Proteus'' and reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], in early July 1881.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=438}} At [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]], Greenland, they picked up two [[Inuit]] dogsled drivers, as well as physician Octave Pierre Pavy and Mr. Clay who had continued scientific studies instead of returning on ''Florence'' with the remainder of the 1880 Howgate Expedition.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=439}}<ref>{{cite journal |pages=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oRoCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=howgate+expedition+1880+-wiki |last=Shrady, G.

''Neptune'', laden with relief supplies, set out in July 1882 but, cut off by ice and weather, Captain Beebe was forced to turn around prematurely. All he could do was leave some supplies at [[Smith Sound]] in August, and the remaining provisions in Newfoundland, with plans for their delivery the following year.\n\nOn July 20, Pavy's contract ended, and Pavy announced that he would not renew it, but would continue to attend to the expedition's medical needs. Greely was incensed, and ordered the doctor to turn over all his records and journals. Pavy refused, and Greely placed him under arrest. Pavy was not confined, however Greely claimed he intended to [[court-martial]] him when they returned to the United States.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=447\u2013448}}\n\n=== Third year, 1883 ===\nIn 1883, new rescue attempts by ''Proteus'', commanded by Lieutenant [[Ernest Albert Garlington]], and ''Yantic'', commanded by Commander Frank Wildes, failed, with ''Proteus'' being crushed by pack ice.\n\n[[File:111-SC-96236 (21832311119).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The six survivors: Private Francis Long, Sergeant Julius R. Frederick, Private Maurice Connell, Steward Henry Bierderbick, Sergeant [[David L. Brainard]], Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]]]]\nIn the summer of 1883, in accordance with his instructions for the case of two consecutive relief expeditions not reaching [[Fort Conger]], Greely decided to head South with his crew. It had been planned that the relief ships should depot supplies along the [[Nares Strait]], around [[Cape Sabine]] and at [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], if they were unable to reach Fort Conger, which should have made for a comfortable wintering of Greely's men. But with ''Neptune'' not even getting that far and ''Proteus'' sunk, in reality only a small emergency cache with 40 days worth of supplies had been laid at Cape Sabine by ''Proteus''.\n\nWhen arriving there in October 1883, the season was too advanced for Greely to either try to brave the [[Baffin Bay]] to reach Greenland with his small boats, or to retire to Fort Conger, so he had to winter on the spot.\n\n=== Fourth year, 1884 ===\nIn 1884, Secretary of the Navy, [[William E. Chandler]], was credited with planning the ensuing rescue effort, commanded by Cdr. [[Winfield Scott Schley]].

During the expedition, two members of the crew reached a new [[Farthest North]] record, but of the original 25&nbsp;men, only seven survived to return.\n\nThe expedition was under the auspices of the Signal Corps at a time when the Corps' Chief Disbursements officer, [[Henry W. Howgate]], was arrested for [[embezzlement]]. However, that did not deter the planning and execution of the voyage.\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== First year, 1881 ===\n[[File:Lady Franklin Bay expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Proteus'' at [[Qeqertarsuaq]] harbor]]\nThe expedition was led by Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]] of the Fifth United States Cavalry, with astronomer [[Edward Israel]] and photographer [[George W. Rice (photographer)|George W. Rice]] among the crew of 21&nbsp;officers and men. They sailed on the ship ''Proteus'' and reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], in early July 1881.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=438}} At [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]], Greenland, they picked up two [[Inuit]] dogsled drivers, as well as physician Octave Pierre Pavy and Mr. Clay who had continued scientific studies instead of returning on ''Florence'' with the remainder of the 1880 Howgate Expedition.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=439}}<ref>{{cite journal |pages=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oRoCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=howgate+expedition+1880+-wiki |last=Shrady, G.

''Neptune'', laden with relief supplies, set out in July 1882 but, cut off by ice and weather, Captain Beebe was forced to turn around prematurely. All he could do was leave some supplies at [[Smith Sound]] in August, and the remaining provisions in Newfoundland, with plans for their delivery the following year.\n\nOn July 20, Pavy's contract ended, and Pavy announced that he would not renew it, but would continue to attend to the expedition's medical needs. Greely was incensed, and ordered the doctor to turn over all his records and journals. Pavy refused, and Greely placed him under arrest. Pavy was not confined, however Greely claimed he intended to [[court-martial]] him when they returned to the United States.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=447\u2013448}}\n\n=== Third year, 1883 ===\nIn 1883, new rescue attempts by ''Proteus'', commanded by Lieutenant [[Ernest Albert Garlington]], and ''Yantic'', commanded by Commander Frank Wildes, failed, with ''Proteus'' being crushed by pack ice.\n\n[[File:111-SC-96236 (21832311119).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The six survivors: Private Francis Long, Sergeant Julius R. Frederick, Private Maurice Connell, Steward Henry Bierderbick, Sergeant [[David L. Brainard]], Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]]]]\nIn the summer of 1883, in accordance with his instructions for the case of two consecutive relief expeditions not reaching [[Fort Conger]], Greely decided to head South with his crew. It had been planned that the relief ships should depot supplies along the [[Nares Strait]], around [[Cape Sabine]] and at [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], if they were unable to reach Fort Conger, which should have made for a comfortable wintering of Greely's men. But with ''Neptune'' not even getting that far and ''Proteus'' sunk, in reality only a small emergency cache with 40 days worth of supplies had been laid at Cape Sabine by ''Proteus''.\n\nWhen arriving there in October 1883, the season was too advanced for Greely to either try to brave the [[Baffin Bay]] to reach Greenland with his small boats, or to retire to Fort Conger, so he had to winter on the spot.\n\n=== Fourth year, 1884 ===\nIn 1884, Secretary of the Navy, [[William E. Chandler]], was credited with planning the ensuing rescue effort, commanded by Cdr. [[Winfield Scott Schley]]. While four vessels\u2014{{USS|Bear|1874|6}}, {{USS|Thetis|1881|6}}, {{HMS|Alert|1856|6}}, and [[Loch Line|''Loch Garry'']]\u2014made it to Greely's camp on June&nbsp;22, only seven men had survived the winter.<ref>Stein, Stephen K (December 2006). \"The Greely Relief Expedition and the New Navy\", ''International Journal of Naval History''</ref> The rest had succumbed to starvation, [[hypothermia]], and drowning, and one man, Private Henry, had been shot on Greely's order for repeated theft of food rations.<ref name=NYTimesAug14Greely>{{cite news|title=Lieut.

On August 14, 1884, a few days after his funeral, the body of Lieutenant Frederick Kislingbury, second in command of the expedition, was exhumed and an autopsy was performed.
